The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes various methods for resetting user options and
registry settings in Microsoft Word.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two basic kinds of options that the user can define in Word. The
first kind affects the way the program operates. The information for this
kind of option is usually stored in the Windows registry. The second kind
of option affects the formatting or appearance of one or more documents.
The information for this option is stored in templates or documents.
<P>
When you troubleshoot odd behavior in the program or in a document first
eliminate the possibility that the problem is caused by a combination of
options and formatting. If the behavior in question occurs in multiple
documents, it may be useful to reset the user settings to the "factory"
defaults either temporally or permanently. To do this, use one of the
methods that is listed in the following table.
<P>
<PRE>   Method                                                   Result
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Hold SHIFT to prevent automatic macros from starting.    Temporary
   Start Word with the /a switch.                           Temporary
   Rename the Normal template.                              Temporary or
                                                            Permanent
   Edit or delete registry entries.                         Permanent

</PRE><h2>HOLDING THE SHIFT KEY</h2>
 
<P>
Word reserves special names for macros that you can create to automatically
alter the way Word behaves. These are called "auto" macros. The auto macros
in Microsoft Word are listed in the following table.
<P>
<PRE>   Macro      Storage location                Automatically Runs
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   AutoExec   In the Normal template          When Word is started
              or in a global add-in

   AutoNew    In a template                   When a new document that is
                                              based on the template is
                                              created

   AutoOpen   In document or template         When a document that is based
                                              on the template or that
                                              contains the macro is opened

   AutoClose  In document or template         When a document that is based
                                              on the template or that
                                              contains the macro is closed

   AutoExit   In the Normal template          When Word is Exited
              or a global add-in

</PRE>Word recognizes a macro with a name that begins with "Auto" as a macro that
automatically runs when the situation to which it applies occurs. You can
prevent an auto macro from running by holding down the SHIFT key while
performing the action that causes the macro to run.
<P>
<P><h2>STARTING WORD USING /A</h2>
 
<P>
Starting Word by using /a on a command line causes Word to use the default
settings for all options and prevents add-ons from being loaded.
<P>
The /a switch allows you to start Word without loading the following
components:

<UL><LI>The global template (Normal.dot)
<LI>Any add-in templates in the Startup folder
<LI>Any add-in libraries (.wll files)
<LI>User settings stored in the Data key in the Windows registry
<P>
</UL>NOTE: When you start Word with the /a switch, changes you make in Word that
affect any of these components are not written to the hard disk when you
quit Word, and the changes are lost.
<P>
For the following example, assume that Word is located in the C:\Program
Files\Microsoft Office\Office folder.
<P>
To start Word 97 by using /a, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Run on the Start menu.

<P><LI>In the Run dialog box, click Browse.

<P><LI>Use the Look In box to locate Winword.exe, and then select it. Then,
   click Open.
<P>
   This step fills in the Open box in the Run dialog box.

<P><LI>In the Open box, move the insertion point after Winword.exe.
<P>
   NOTE: The path to the Winword.exe in the Run dialog box is enclosed in
   quotation marks. Be sure to move the insertion point to the right of the
   closing quotation mark.

<P><LI>Type a space, and then type "/a" (without the quotation marks).
<P>
   The statement in the Open box should resemble the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      "C:\PROGRAM FILES\MICROSOFT OFFICE\OFFICE\WINWORD.EXE" /A
</PRE><P>
</OL>If starting the program with the /a switch corrects the problem, use the
following methods to further isolate the problem.
<P>
<P><h2>RENAMING THE NORMAL TEMPLATE</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent formatting, AutoText, and macros that are stored in the Normal
template (Normal.dot) from affecting behavior of the program and documents
that are opened, rename Normal.dot. Renaming allows you to quickly
determine whether the Normal template is causing the problem or behavior.
<P>
NOTE: Renaming the Normal.dot template resets several options back to
the default settings, including custom styles, custom toolbars, macros,
and AutoText entries. For this reason, Microsoft strongly recommends that
you rename the Normal.dot file.
<P>
Certain kinds of configurations may create more than one Normal.dot file.
These situations include cases in which multiple versions of Word are
running on the same computer or cases in which several workstation
installations exist on the same computer. In these situations, be sure to
rename the correct copy of Normal.dot.
<P>
To rename the Normal.dot file, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI> Quit all instances of Word, including WordMail.

<P><LI> On the Windows taskbar, click Start, point to Find, and click Files Or
<P><PRE>    Folders.
</PRE>
<P><LI> In the Named box, type "Normal.dot" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI> In the Look In box, select your local hard disk drive (or an
<P><PRE>    alternate user template location if you are running Word from a
    network server).
</PRE>
<P><LI> Click Find Now to search for the file.

<P><LI> For each occurrence of Normal.dot that appears in the Find dialog
<P><PRE>    box, right-click the file. Click Rename on the shortcut menu. Give
    the file a new name, such as OldNormal.dot or Normal-1.dot.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Quit the find dialog box and restart Word normally (without using the
<P><PRE>    /a switch).
</PRE><P>
</OL>If Word starts correctly, you have resolved the problem. In this case the
problem is a damaged Normal.dot template. You may need to change a few
settings to restore your favorite options. If the Normal.dot file you
renamed contains customizations, such as styles, macros, or AutoText
entries that cannot be easily recreated, you may be able to copy those
customizations from the old Normal.dot file to the new Normal.dot file by
using the organizer.
<P>
For more information about using the organizer, click the Office Assistant,
type "using the organizer," click Search, and then click "Use settings from
another document or template."
<P>
<P><h2>SAVING AND THEN DELETING REGISTRY ENTRIES</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
Deleting the Data Key:
<P>
NOTE: Deleting the Data key resets several options back to the default
settings, including the File menu most recently used file list, and many
settings you customize in the Options dialog boxes.
<P>
Most common options (click Options on the Tools menu) are stored in the
data key. One troubleshooting step is to delete the data key. Word rebuilds
this data key by using the default settings the next time the program is
started.
<P>
To delete the Data key, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI> Quit all instances of Word, including WordMail.

<P><LI> On the Windows taskbar, click the Start button and click Run.

<P><LI> In the Open box, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks), and
<P><PRE>    click OK.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Locate the following key by double-clicking the appropriate
<P><PRE>    folders.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word\Data
</PRE>
<P><LI> With the Data folder selected (on the left), click Delete on the Edit
<P><PRE>    menu to delete the key.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Click Yes when you are prompted to confirm the deletion.

<P><LI> Quit the registry editor and restart Word normally (without using
<P><PRE>    the /a switch).
</PRE><P>
</OL>If Word starts correctly, you have resolved the problem. The problem is a
damaged Data key. You may need to change a few settings to restore your
favorite options.
<P>
To edit or delete other registry entries:
<P>
Use the preceding steps but substitute the correct registry key in step 4,
and then use Modify or Delete in step 5
<P>
NOTE: Some keys are automatically rebuilt when you run Word. To rebuild
other keys, you must reinstall the program by using the /y switch on the
command line to recreate the correct entry. For more information see the
following section.
<P>
<P><h3>USING SETUP /Y</h3>
 
<P>
The /y switch prevents Setup from copying files. Setup proceeds normally,
including setting registry entries; however, it does not copy any files to
the computer. Use this switch to restore registry entry values or to track
down process problems without copying files.
<P>
This switch may be used when running Microsoft Office 97 Setup in
maintenance mode, for example
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;D&gt;:\setup /y

</PRE></OL>where &lt;D&gt; is the location of the program compact disc.
<P>
<P><h3>WHERE SETTINGS ARE STORED IN THE REGISTRY</h3>
 
<P>
Word 97 stores all of its settings in the Windows registry; Word 97 no
longer stores information in a *.ini file or in the Winword.opt file as do
Word 2.X and 6.x.
<P>
This section lists the settings in the registry that pertain to Word 97.
The locations are organized into the following sections:

<UL><LI>Main locations of Word settings
<LI>Settings in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word
<LI>Settings in HKEY\CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Common
<LI>Settings in HKEY\CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\MS Setup (ACME)
<LI>Settings in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools
<LI>Miscellaneous settings
<LI>Using the RegOptions macro
<P>
</UL><h3>Main Locations of Word Settings</h3>
 
<P>
Most settings in Word are stored in the following key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word

</PRE>Changes made to this HKEY_CURRENT_USER key are mirrored in the following
key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_USERS\Default\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word

</PRE>The difference between the two locations is that first one applies only to
the current user of the system while the other one is the default for all
users. However, Word entries are the same for both; so, any change made to
one is automatically reflected in the other.
<P>
NOTE: For the remainder of this section, all references to the
HKEY_CURRENT_USER key apply also to the HKEY_USERS key except where noted.
<P>
<P><h3>SETTINGS IN HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word</h3>
 
<P>
The settings that you may need to examine during troubleshooting are
located in this key. The Data key and the Options key are the most
frequently changed areas.
<P>
<P><h3>Data Key</h3>
 
<P>
Path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word\Data
<P>
The Word 97 for Windows equivalent to the Word 6.x Winword.opt file is the
Data key. This key contains binary information for most recently used
lists, including the most recently used file list and the most recently
used address book list. It also contains the same information that is
stored in the Winword.opt file in Word for Windows 6.x, such as Track
Changes settings (Revision settings in Word 6.x) and Edit settings.
<P>
<P><h3>Default Save Key</h3>
 
<P>
Path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word\Default Save
<P>
This key sets the default format for saving documents. You can change the
default format Word 97 uses by changing the Save Word Files As setting in
Word. To locate this option in Word, click Options on the Tools menu, and
then click the Save tab.
<P>
<P><h3>Options Key</h3>
 
<P>
Path: \\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word\Options
<P>
This key stores the options that you can set from Word either by changing
menu options or by running the RegOptions macro. These are the editable
options.
<P>
The settings fall into two groups: default settings and optional settings.
Default settings are established during Setup. You can change them by
modifying options in Word. Optional settings are not created during Setup;
to add them you must run the RegOptions macro.
<P>
These default settings are the following:
