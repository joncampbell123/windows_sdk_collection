<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word for Windows uses the MS-DOS file sharing utility
(SHARE.EXE) to allow more than one instance of itself to run
simultaneously. SHARE accomplishes this by enabling Word for Windows
to access the same file more than once. When two Word for Windows
sessions are running on a system, both can simultaneously access the
NORMAL.DOT and WINWORD.INI files if SHARE is installed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
SHARE allows two different Word users on a network to open the same
file. Without SHARE loaded, the system returns an error message if two
users try to open the same file at the same time. With SHARE loaded,
Word informs the second user that someone else has the file open and
asks whether or not the second user wants to open a copy of that file.
<P>
Many networks, such as Novell, include a utility that handles file
sharing; therefore, SHARE is not usually necessary for sharing Word
for Windows files over a network.
<P>
Word for Windows operates correctly without SHARE loaded; however,
without SHARE, Word loses the ability to run two sessions
simultaneously and the ability to allow two people to access the same
file at once.
<P>
For more information on SHARE, refer to pages 565-566 of the
"Microsoft MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference," version 5.0.
