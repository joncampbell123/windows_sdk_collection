The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Assistant for Word, versions 2.0, 2.0z, 2.02b, 2.03z,
   2.04z
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Internet Assistant 2.0 - 2.04z to a workstation
installation of Word, you receive one of the following error messages:
<P>
<P><h3>Word for Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Setup could not create the folder:
   "\\&lt;path to server installation&gt;\ISGDI32.DLL"

</PRE><h3>Word for Windows NT</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Setup could not open the file:
   "\\&lt;path to server installation&gt;\ISGDI32.DLL"

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Isgdi32.dll file is not able to install to the server location that
contains the Winword.exe program file. This file will need to be copied to
the server manually.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
When you get one of the error messages listed in the Symptoms section,
click the Ignore button. When Setup is completed, copy the Isgdi32.dll file
into the directory on the server where the shared Winword.exe file is
located, using one of the following methods:
<P>
Method 1: If you have access to a personal computer that has a local
<PRE>          installation of Word, install Internet Assistant on this
          computer, and then copy the Isgdi32.dll file from the local
          installation to the shared directory on the network where you
          installed Winword.exe.

</PRE>Method 2. If you don't have access to a local installation of Word, use the
<PRE>          following steps to manually extract the file from the Ia1.cab
          file. (This file is part of the self-extracting archive.)

          a. Start Internet Assistant setup. When prompted to select the
             installation type, minimize the Setup program and search the
             hard disk for the Ia1.cab file. Copy this file to another
             folder (subdirectory).

          b. Maximize Internet Assistant Setup, and then click the Exit
             Setup button.

          c. Extract the Isgdi32.dll file from the Ia1.cab file. To
             extract this file from drive A to C:\Windows\Temp, for
             example, use the Windows 95 Extract.exe file.  To do this,
             click Start on the Windows Taskbar, point to Run and type the
             following command in the Open box:

                extract a:\ia1.cab isgdi32.dll /l c:\windows\temp

          d. Copy the extracted file, Isgdi32.dll, to the network server
             directory that contains the Winword.exe file.

</PRE>Once this file is on the network server, subsequent workstation
installations of Internet Assistant will be successful.
<P>
For additional information on using the Extract tool, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE>followed by:
<P>
