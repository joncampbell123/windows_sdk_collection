The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 95 for Windows, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Multilevel numbers do not increment based on the level of the Heading style
that is applied to a paragraph.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Multilevel numbering is designed to increment based on the left indent
applied to a paragraph. It is not designed to number paragraphs formatted
with Heading styles. In fact, the Multilevel tab is not available in the
Bullets And Numbering dialog box when the first paragraph in the selection
is a heading paragraph. To number paragraphs formatted with heading style,
click Heading Numbering on the Format menu.
<P>
The Multilevel tab is available when the first paragraph in the selection
is not formatted with a heading style, even though the selection may
contain some heading paragraphs. When Multilevel numbering is applied to a
selection that contains some paragraphs formatted with heading styles, the
heading paragraphs are numbered based on their indents rather than
their heading style level.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design in the versions of Microsoft Word listed at the 
beginning of this article. The Heading Numbering command (on the Format 
menu) should be used to number paragraphs formatted with heading styles. 
<P>
This design was changed in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows and Word 98 
Macintosh Edition.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following example demonstrates how the first choice in the Multilevel
Numbering Style Gallery would be applied to a mixture of paragraphs 
formatted with Normal style and Heading styles.

<OL><P><LI>Normal Style
</OL>2. Heading 1 Style
<PRE>   a) Normal Style
      i) Heading 2 Style

</PRE></OL>When multilevel numbering is reapplied to a heading paragraph that is
indented after multilevel numbering is first applied, the indent is
removed and the paragraph reverts to the indentation defined by the
heading style.
<P>
If Heading Numbering had previously been applied to the heading paragraphs,
it would not be disturbed by the application of Multilevel numbering to the
Normal style paragraphs in the selection. For example, when using the first
Gallery style from both Heading Numbering and Multilevel numbering, the
result is as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Normal Style
</OL>I. Heading 1 Style
<PRE>   a) Normal Style
   A. Heading 2 Style

</PRE></OL><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
