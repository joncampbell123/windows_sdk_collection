<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to delete unwanted temporary files from your
computer. Temporary files are created by programs for storing data
temporarily, and are then deleted when the programs quit. If an program
quits unexpectedly, it will not delete its temporary files. You should
periodically remove any leftover temporary files. These files are stored in
a separate directory that is specified in the Autoexec.Bat file.
<P>
It is important to remember that since many programs create temporary files
while they are running, removing temporary files should be done at the MS-
DOS level. Programs generally delete most of the temporary files created
when the program is properly closed. At the MS-DOS prompt, all programs
should be closed, including Microsoft Windows. This will prevent deleting a
temporary file that is currently in use.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Removing the temporary files requires the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Determine the location of the temporary directory.

<P><LI>Exit all programs.

<P><LI>Determine the existence of any temporary files and remove them.
<P>
</OL><h3>Determine the Temporary Directory</h3>
 
<P>
There are several methods to determine the location of the temporary
directory. Follow one of the methods described below.
<P>
NOTE: Once the location of the directory is established, it is also
important to verify that the specified directory exists.
<P>
Method 1: (From Microsoft Word)
<P>
<PRE>       a. On the Help menu, click About Microsoft Word.

       b. Click the System Info button.

       c. From the Choose a Category window, select System.

       d. TEMP Directory will be in the list box. This is where the
          location of the temporary directory is specified. Make note of
          the location.

</PRE></OL>Method 2: (Using the System Configuration Editor)
<P>
<PRE>          a. Start the System Configuration Editor:

             1) In Program Manager, click Run on the File menu.

             2) In the Command Line, type "sysedit" (without the quotation
                marks).

             3) Click OK.

          b. All of the system files will be cascaded in the System
             Configuration Editor. The Autoexec.bat file should be on top.
             If the file is not shown, choose C:\Autoexec.bat from the
             Window menu.

          c. There should be a line in the Autoexec.bat that reads

                SET TEMP= &lt;location&gt;

             This is the location of your temporary directory. Make note
             of the location.

</PRE>Method 3: (From the MS-DOS Prompt)
<P>
<PRE>          a. Quit all programs, including Windows.

          b. Make sure your MS-DOS prompt is at the root directory, shown
             as "C:\&gt;" (without the quotation marks).

          c. Type "set" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER. This
             will display the environment variables on your system. There
             may be two entries listed here. The first should read
             "TEMP=&lt;location&gt;", and the second may read "TMP=&lt;location&gt;".
             Make note of the locations.

</PRE><h3>Verify the Temporary Directory</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the MS-DOS prompt, type "CD &lt;temp directory&gt;" (without the
   quotation marks) where &lt;temp directory&gt; is the location of the temporary
   directory as determined by one of the methods listed above.

<P><LI>If the directory is valid, the MS-DOS prompt will reflect that you are
   now in that directory. If the directory does not exist, the message
   "Invalid directory" will appear.
<P>
   NOTE: If the directory does not exist, it will be necessary to create
   one. This can be done by typing "md &lt;directory name&gt;" (without the
   quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt.
<P>
</OL><h3>Delete Temporary Files</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the MS-DOS prompt, type "cd &lt;temp directory&gt;" (without the
   quotation marks), where &lt;temp directory&gt; is the location of the
   temporary directory as determined by one of the methods listed above.
   You should now see the name of the temporary directory included in the
   prompt. This means that you are now in that directory.

<P><LI>Type "dir *.tmp" (without the quotation marks) at the prompt. This will
   list any existing temporary files on your system. Most temporary files
   will have the extension .tmp.

<P><LI>If there are any temporary files on your system, they can be removed. To
   delete these files, type the following "del *.tmp" (without the
   quotation marks).
<P>
   NOTE: Repeat step 2 to verify the temporary files have been removed.
