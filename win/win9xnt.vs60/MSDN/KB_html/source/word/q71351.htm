<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word for Windows 1.x includes an OrgChart macro that
generates an organizational chart using the outline of the current
document. The macro uses a Word for Windows table and table borders to
create the organizational chart effect. An updated version of this
macro is available for Word version 2.x for Windows users on the
application note titled "Frequently Requested WordBasic Macros for
Word for Windows 2.0." For more information, query on the following
words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   WD0523 and Appnote

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The OrgChart macro uses the heading levels defined in the current
document to generate a multilevel organizational chart using the table
function in Word for Windows. You can install the OrgChart macro by
following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the file EXAMPLES.DOC in Word for Windows.

<P><LI>Press the Install button next to the OrgChart listing.
<P>
</OL>The install process adds OrgChart as a global macro, copies the
necessary glossary entries and adds OrgChart to the Macro menu. Be sure
to save global, glossary, and command changes when exiting the program
to save the macro for future use.
<P>
To see how the macro operates, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open up a new document in Word for Windows.

<P><LI>Type the following words so that each word is a separate
   paragraph:
<P>
<P><PRE>      President
      Vice President
      Secretary
      Treasurer
</PRE>
<P><LI>Place the insertion point in the word President, press CTRL+S,
   type "Heading 1" (without the quotation marks), and press ENTER.

<P><LI>Place the cursor in the word Vice President, press CTRL+S, type
   "Heading 2", and press ENTER.

<P><LI>Highlight the words Secretary and Treasurer, press CTRL+S, type
   "Heading 3", and press ENTER.

<P><LI>From the Macro menu, choose OrgChart to create an organizational
   chart from this document.

<P><LI>The macro now prompts "Save changes to Document?" Choosing Yes
   or No does not affect the creation of the chart. The prompt is
   simply a precaution against losing data.

<P><LI>A dialog box containing options for the paper size, outline range,
   and orientation of the chart document appears. For this example,
   select Letter, All, and Portrait, respectively.

<P><LI>The next message reads "About to create chart using levels 1
   to 3, using "President" as the prime. Continue?" Choose Yes.
<P>
</OL>The macro goes through the process of extracting information from the
outline for each level and constructing each level of the chart from
this information. When the macro has finished running, a new document
is created containing the words from the original document in an
organizational chart, with each level displayed as a lower branch
extending from the prime.
<P>
Note: For the chart to be created correctly, there can only be one
"prime" defined in the original document. If you want the "prime" to
be a heading 1 style, make sure there is only one heading 1 style
entry in the original document.
<P>
Note: If there is a blank line between the Heading 1 and Heading 2
lines, the organization chart does not include any of the lower
levels. It  stops at Heading 1 and only includes that level in the
resulting organization chart.
