<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A dropped capital letter ("drop cap") can cause problems with envelope 
addressing or table of content creation.
<P>
Because many functions in Word for Windows operate on a paragraph level,
and because the Drop Cap command creates an additional paragraph in the
document, many paragraph-based operations in Word may be affected.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The two most common problems associated with drop caps concern envelope 
addressing and table of content creation.
<P>
<P><h3>Envelope Addressing</h3>
 
<P>
When you create envelopes, Word searches in the current document for a
possible mailing address. If you have formatted a drop cap at the beginning
of the mailing address in your document, Word does not correctly choose the
entire mailing address for the Envelope dialog box. If you do not select
anything, Word "guesses" the address minus the first letter (the one with
drop cap formatting).
<P>
The easiest workaround for this situation is to accept the guess that Word 
makes and then type the appropriate first letter. If you select the drop 
cap and the rest of the address, Word chooses just the letter with the drop 
cap formatting as the mailing address.
<P>
<P><h3>Tables of Contents</h3>
 
<P>
A common way to create a table of contents (TOC) is to build it from
styles. If your drop cap paragraph is formatted with a heading style and
you create a TOC based on heading styles, the drop cap letter appears by
itself as a TOC entry, and the rest of the original paragraph appears as a
second TOC entry.
<P>
To work around this problem, use Table of Contents Entry (TC) fields to
mark the TOC entries instead of using the heading styles.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Word includes the Drop Cap command on the Format menu to allow easy
creation of a dropped capital letter ("drop cap") at the beginning of a
sentence. When you use this feature, Word inserts a new framed paragraph in
the document. Since the drop cap is in a separate paragraph, it behaves as
a separate paragraph and may cause unwanted behavior in some situations.
