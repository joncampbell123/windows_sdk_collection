<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you run one of the Microsoft Direct Mail Manager mailing wizards for
use with Microsoft Word 97, a sample data record is created and attached.
This article discusses how this process works.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>What Is the Sample Data Record?</h3>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Word 97 templates, Flyer Wizard, Letter Wizard,
or Postcard Wizard that come with Microsoft Direct Mail Manager, a sample
data record is created and attached to the main document.
<P>
The sample data record that is created is called Samplerecord.csv and it is
created in the Windows temp directory. It contains one record of data which
can be used as a sample data file.
<P>
Samplerecord.csv is a text-only file. However, because the .csv file name
extension is associated with Microsoft Excel, double-clicking the file will
open the file in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h3>How the Samplerecord.csv File Created?</h3>
 
<P>
Samplerecord.csv is generated when the wizards are run. It is not installed
by Microsoft Direct Mail Manager. When the wizards are run for the first
time, the Samplerecord.csv file is created. After the file is created, the
wizards use the existing Samplerecord.csv file.
<P>
<P><h3>Troubleshooting Problems with Samplerecord.csv</h3>
 
<P>
If the Samplerecord.csv is damaged, you may receive an error message about
the merge fields being invalid, or you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Word could not open the data source.

</PRE>To resolve this problem, delete the existing Samplerecord.csv and re-run
the wizard. A new Samplerecord.csv file will be created.
