The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh versions 3.0, 3.01, 3.02, 4.0,
   5.0, 5.1, 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you are saving a document in Microsoft Word for the Macintosh and
the program unexpectedly quits, a "Word Temp #" file will remain in
the same folder the document was originally located. It will contain
the text and formatting of the last saved version of the file.
<P>
<P><h3>Word Version 5.0 and Later</h3>
 
<P>
When using Word under System 7.0, Word Temp files are placed in an
invisible folder called Temporary Items in the root directory. If Word
unexpectedly quits, this folder becomes visible. If the machine is
restarted, this folder will be moved to the trash and placed in a
folder called "Rescued Items from &lt;hard disk name&gt;" and will then need
to be dragged back to the hard disk. It can then be recovered using
one of the methods listed below.
<P>
If the machine is not restarted and Word is launched the Temp file
will be erased from the Temporary Items folder and will not be able to
be recovered. If the Temp file is moved from the Temporary Items
folder BEFORE Word is launched, it can then be recovered using one of
the methods listed below.
<P>
Under System 6.x, the Word Temp files are stored in System Folder as
described below.
<P>
<P><h3>Word Version 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
Word also creates a "Word Temp #" file in the System Folder of the
start-up disk every time the program is run. Under normal operating
conditions, these "Word Temp #" files are removed when you choose Quit
from the File menu. If the program unexpectedly quits, this file will
be left in the System Folder. These temporary files usually do not
contain usable information and can be discarded.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To see if the "Word Temp #" files contain any of your text, choose By
Size from the Finder View menu to see the size of the files. If the
files are fairly large, you can try to recover the text using one of
the following two methods:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Word Version 5.0 5.1:

<OL><P><LI>Start Word.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open.

<P><LI>From the List Files of Type pop-up menu, choose All Files.

<P><LI>Select a "Word Temp #" file, and then click Open. The temporary
   file will be opened.
<P>
</OL>Word 4.0 or 3.0:

<OL><P><LI>Start Word.

<P><LI>Hold down the SHIFT key and choose Open Any File from the File
   menu.

<P><LI>Select a "Word Temp #" file, then click Open. The temporary file
   will be opened.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Using MacTools, Fedit Plus, or some other disk-utility package,
   change the "File Type" of the Word Temp file from WTMP to WDBN
   (capital letters must be used).

<P><LI>Try to open the document in Word.
<P>
</OL>If there is text remaining in the "Word Temp #" file, it will open up
in an untitled window. Please note that the file will probably contain
a lot of useless characters that must be cleaned out.
<P>
In Word versions 1.0x, the temporary files are called "MWxxx". You can
use the second method to recover these files.
<P>
If "Word Temp #" files are accumulating rapidly and for no apparent
reason, make sure you do not have version 3.0. This version does not
always remove the temporary files upon quitting. For more information,
query on the following words:
