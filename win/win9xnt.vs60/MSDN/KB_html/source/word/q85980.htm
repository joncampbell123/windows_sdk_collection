The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh versions 5.0, 5.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Word, you can create white text on a black background using three
different methods. These methods are accomplished by using a
combination of character and paragraph formatting, by using the
Picture command, or by using PostScript commands.
<P>
The character and paragraph formatting method and the PostScript
commands method reverse entire paragraphs of text. The Picture command
can be used to reverse a word or words. However, since a graphic is
created with this method, positioning (using the Format Frame command)
is often necessary to obtain the desired results.
<P>
<P><h3>Character and Paragraph Formatting</h3>
 
<P>
To create reverse type using character and paragraph formatting,
do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Select the paragraph (or paragraphs) to be reversed.

<P><LI>From the Format menu, choose Character.

<P><LI>From the Color box, select White. Choose the OK button.

<P><LI>From the Format menu, choose Border.

<P><LI>From the Shading box, select 100%. Choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL>The text should now appear in reverse type.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Picture Command</h3>
 
<P>
To create reverse type with the Picture command, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Place the insertion point at the location where the graphic will be
   inserted.

<P><LI>From the Insert menu, choose Picture. Choose the New Picture
   button.

<P><LI>From the Tool palette, select the Text tool. Click in the Picture
   window and type the desired text.

<P><LI>Select the text with the Selection Tool. From the Line Color
   palette, select white.

<P><LI>Select one of the shape tools (square, circle, and so on) and draw
   a shape around the text.

<P><LI>With the shape selected, click the Fill Color palette and select
   Black.

<P><LI>With the shape selected, click the Front/Back tool and select
   Send To Back.

<P><LI>Close the Picture window.
<P>
</OL>The graphic should now appear in the document.
<P>
When you create a graphic in the Microsoft Word for the Macintosh,
Picture Window, graphic elements such as circles and squares have a
default background fill of 100 percent. If this object is then printed
and the printer is setup to print Black &amp; White, the graphic will
print solid black. Even if the color of the filled graphic is white.
The graphic can be printed as a white solid fill if the printer is set
to Color/Grayscale. To set the LaserWriter to Color/Grayscale,
select Print from the File menu and choose the Color/Grayscale button.
<P>
<P><h3>PostScript Commands</h3>
 
<P>
For more information on using PostScript commands to create reverse
text, query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
