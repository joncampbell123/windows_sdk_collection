The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The size of chart objects will increase dramatically when you paste them
into a Word document. This occurs when all of the following conditions are
true:

<UL><LI>Two or more chart objects are selected at the same time in an Excel 98
   spreadsheet (to do this, click the first object, press SHIFT, and click
   the next object).
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The chart objects are copied to the Clipboard (to do this, press
   COMMAND+C).

<LI>The objects are pasted into a Word document using COMMAND+V.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Copy and Paste the Chart Objects Individually</h3>
 
<P>
Use this method if you want the charts to appear as separate objects.
To paste the charts as separate objects, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Excel, copy the first chart that you want to appear in the Word
   document.

<P><LI>In Word, position the insertion point where you want the chart to
   appear, and click Paste on the Edit menu.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Copy and Paste the Chart Objects as a Unit</h3>
 
<P>
If you want the charts to appear together in a single picture object, use
the Paste Special command and select the Picture option.
<P>
To paste the charts as a single picture, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Excel, select the charts you want to appear in the Word document (to
   select multiple charts, press the SHIFT key as you make your
   selections).

<P><LI>On the edit menu, click Paste Special.

<P><LI>In the Paste Special dialog box, under As, select Picture, and click OK.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The charts will not be separate objects and must be positioned and
sized together.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
