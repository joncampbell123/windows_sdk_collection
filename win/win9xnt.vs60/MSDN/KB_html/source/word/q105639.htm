The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Word 6.x-7.x, if a table row marked as Headings has a cell that contains
a number with no other text characters, the formula SUM(Above) incorrectly 
includes the value from the heading row cell into the calculation.
<P>
In Word 97 for Windows and Word 98 Macintosh Edition, the formula 
SUM(Above) incorrectly includes the value from the heading row into the 
calculation even if the cell in the Heading row of the table contains text 
and a number.
<P>
This happens only on the first page of the table.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When Word searches for the contiguous cells, it starts at the formula cell
and continues up until it finds the first cell containing a number. It 
stops when it encounters the first blank cell or cell containing a number 
and/or text characters above the last cell that contains a number only.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following are some examples where the formula results are incorrect and 
others where the results are correct.
<P>

</PRE>NOTE: Word 97 for Windows and Word 98 Macintosh Edition returns 8 in Row4 
Column3.
<P>
Row 1 of the Sample Table was marked as Headings (select the row and
click Headings on the Table menu).
<P>
Result of Row4 Column1:

<UL><LI>The result of the formula includes the numeric value of the heading for
   that column.
<P>
</UL>Result of Row4 Column2:

<UL><LI>The result of the formula includes the set of contiguous cells that 
   contain numeric values.
<P>
</UL>Result of Row4 Column3:

<UL><LI>The result of the formula does not include the heading for that column
   because it also contains text characters. But the value of Row3 Column3
   is included in the results because there is a numeric value in that
   cell. Cells containing numeric values along with text are only 
   included with the formula results Word encounters them before the
   first cell containing only numbers (remembering Word calculates from the
   formula upwards). Word 97 for Windows and Word 98 Macintosh Edition
   returns 8 because it includes the value 3 from Row1 Column 3.
<P>
</UL>Result of Row4 Column4:

<UL><LI>The result of the formula does not include the heading for that column
   because there is a blank cell above the last cell containing only
   numbers.
<P>
</UL>The behavior described above for columns also applies to summing rows using
Table/Formula. The Formula will read SUM(Left) if placed in a row with
cells containing numbers to the left of the target cell, and no numbers
above the target cell in the same column.
<P>
If there are numbers in the column above the target cell, as well as to the
left, the default formula in the dialog box will read SUM(Above). This may
be edited to read SUM(Left) to sum the row instead. Note that if there is a
cell above the target cell that contains only text, below other cells
containing numbers, SUM(Left) is offered as the default.
<P>
The formulas SUM(Below) and SUM(Right) are also valid in the appropriate
cell context, but are never offered as a default. If there are no cells
containing numbers to the left or above the target cell the default offered
is only '='. You may add the SUM formula you want to the dialog box field.
