The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you insert a cross-reference to a ListNum field, the cross-reference
may not include the complete ListNum context if all of the following
conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The ListNum field is located previous to the cross-reference.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The cross-reference is being inserted into a paragraph containing a
   higher level ListNum then the ListNum being referenced.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>There is not a higher level ListNum field (other than the ListNum field
   contained in the paragraph where the cross-reference is being inserted)
   between the cross-reference and the ListNum that is being cross-
   referenced.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Consider using outline numbering or a combination of outline numbering and
ListNum fields.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A cross-reference to a ListNum field should include the entire context of
the ListNum that is being cross-referenced unless there are no higher level
ListNum fields between the paragraph containing the cross-reference and the
ListNum field that is being cross-referenced.
<P>
In the following discussion, the term ListNum "context" is used. A
paragraph is said to be in the same ListNum context as a certain ListNum
field if no higher level ListNum fields occur between the paragraph and the
ListNum field.
<P>
Here is a sample list with the numbering created using ListNum fields:
<P>
<PRE>   ------------------------------------
   1) This is a ListNum of level 1
        a) This is a ListNum of level 2
        b) This is a ListNum of level 2

   2) This is a ListNum of level 1
        a) This is a ListNum of level 2
        b) This is a ListNum of level 2
        c) This is a ListNum of level 2
        d) This is a ListNum of level 2

   3) This is a ListNum of level 1
        a) This is a ListNum of level 2
        b) This is a ListNum of level 2
   ------------------------------------

</PRE>Cross-references to this list:
<P>
If you insert a cross-reference in line 2d and reference either line 2a,
2b, 2c, or 2d, you will only get "a)," "b)," "c)," or "d)" as the cross
reference because the cross-reference is in the same context as the item
being cross-referenced.
<P>
However, if you insert a cross-reference in line 2d and reference either
line 1a, 1b, 3a, or 3b, you will get the full context "1)a)," "1)b),"
"3)a)," or "3)b)" as the cross-reference because the cross-reference is in
a different context than the item being cross-referenced.
<P>
The problem also occurs when you insert a cross-reference in line 3) and
reference 2a, 2b, 2c, or 2d. You should get the full context of "2)a),"
"2)b)," "2)c)," or "2)d)" because you are referencing a line that is
outside the context of the paragraph where you are inserting the cross
reference. However, in this situation, you will get the incorrect cross-
reference of "a," "b," "c," or "d."
<P>
NOTE: Inserting a cross-reference in line "3)" and cross-referencing lines
"1a" or "1b" works correctly (giving you the full context).
