The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains guidelines you can use to troubleshoot the following
file locking behaviors that may occur when you open a master document or
its subdocuments in Word:

<UL><LI>Scenario 1: Some subdocuments are locked, while others are unlocked.

<LI>Scenario 2: Word opens the file as read-only or the following
   error messages occur when you open a master document and then try to
   unlock or open a subdocument:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;Filename&gt; is being used by &lt;user name&gt;. Do you want to
      make a copy?
</PRE>
<LI>Scenario 3: When you attempt to unlock a subdocument, the following
   error occurs and Word does not unlock the subdocument:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The operation cannot be completed because the subdocument has a
      different type of protection from the master document. Make the
      protection the same for the master document and the subdocuments.
</PRE>
<LI>Scenario 4: When you attempt to unlock a subdocument, you receive the
   following error message and Word does not unlock the document:
<P>
<P><PRE>      An unlocked subdocument already exists in another master document.
</PRE><P>
</UL>NOTE: Several of the workarounds below will require you to compare the
information in the Name field as compared to the Author field. To locate
these fields, use the procedure appropriate for your version of Word.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 7.x</h3>
 
<P>
Author Field:
<P>
To locate the Author field, click Properties on the File menu, and click
the Summary tab.
<P>
Name Field:
<P>
To locate the Name field, click Options on the Tools menu, and click the
User Info tab.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 6.x</h3>
 
<P>
Author Field
<P>
To locate the Author field, click Summary Info on the File menu.
<P>
Name Field:
<P>
To locate the Name field, click Options on the Tools menu, and click the
User Info tab.
<P>
<P><h2>SCENARIO 1: SOME SUBDOCUMENTS LOCKED, OTHERS UNLOCKED</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Cause</h3>
 
<P>
Word unlocks those subdocuments in which the Author field matches the Name
field. Word locks those subdocuments in which the Author and Name fields do
not match. These fields are case sensitive.
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
If you are not the author of the subdocument, you must first unlock the
subdocument before you can edit it. To unlock a subdocument, position the
insertion point in the subdocument and click the Lock Document button on
the Master Document toolbar.
<P>
If you want all the subdocuments to be unlocked when you open the master
document, do one or both of the following:

<UL><LI>Change the Author field in each subdocument to match the Name field.

<LI>Change the Name field so that it matches the Author field in each
   subdocument. (This workaround works only if the Author name is the same
   in all the subdocuments.)
<P>
</UL><h2>SCENARIO 2: MASTER DOCUMENT OPENED AS READ-ONLY</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Cause</h3>
 
<P>
This problem may occur for either of the following reasons:

<UL><LI>Cause 1: Over a network, another user has the master document open for
   editing. Normal network file locking applies in this situation. When you
   attempt to open the file over a network, you will receive the following
   error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;Filename&gt; is being used by &lt;user name&gt;. Do you want to make a copy?
</PRE><P>
   When you click OK, it will open the master document as Read-Only. It may
   not indicate that the file is Read-only; however, if you make a change
   to the master document and try to save it, the following message will
   appear:
<P>
<P><PRE>      This file is in use by another application or user.
</PRE><P>
   When you click OK, the Save As dialog box will appear where you could
   save the file out as a different name or press Cancel to make no
   changes.
   
   If you try to make a change to a subdocument, you will note that the
   subdocuments are locked. When you click in one of the subdocuments and
   then click the Lock Document button on the Master Document toolbar, the
   following message appears:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The file cannot be opened with write privileges.
</PRE><P>
   Clicking OK will take you back to the master document. You will not be
   able to open the subdocument.

<LI>Cause 2: If you are not the author of the master document, Word opens
   the document as read-only. You are not the author if the Author field
   does not match the Name field.
<P>
<P>
</UL><h3>Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
If the file is being used over a network by another user, the other user
must close the master document before you can open it as read-write.
<P>
If you are not the author of the master document, use either of the
following workarounds.
<P>
Method 1: Temporarily Unlock the Master Document:
<P>
<PRE>   Position the insertion point in the master document and click the Lock
   Document button on the Master Document toolbar.
   
   This will enable you to make changes to the master document and then to
   save the master document. Keep in mind that the subdocuments may still
   be locked. See "Scenario 1" in the "Symptoms" section of this article
   for information about subdocuments being locked.
   
   The next time you open the master document, it will be Read-Only again.

</PRE>Method 2: Permanently Unlock the Master Document:
<P>
<PRE>   To prevent the master document from being opened as read-only, in the
   master document, change the Name field so it matches the Author field.
   When you close and then reopen the master document, Word opens it as
   read-write.

</PRE><h2>SCENARIO 3: "DIFFERENT TYPE OF PROTECTION..." ERROR MESSAGE</h2>
 
<P>
In this scenario, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The operation cannot be completed because the subdocument has a
   different type of protection from the master document. Make the
   protection the same for the master document and the subdocuments.

</PRE><h3>Cause</h3>
 
<P>
You tried to unlock a subdocument whose document protection type or
revision marking status is different from that of the master document.
This error occurs if any of the following documentation protection or
revision marking combinations exist:

<UL><LI>The master document is unprotected and the subdocument is protected for
   revisions, annotations, or forms.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Revision marking is turned on in either the subdocument or the master
   document (not both).
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Both the subdocument and master document are protected, but each one is
   protected for a different type, such as annotations, revisions, or
   forms.
<P>
</UL><h3>Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
Change or remove document protection in the master document and open the
subdocument by itself and change or remove document protection so the
protection type matches that of the master document.
<P>
<P><h2>SCENARIO 4: "UNLOCKED DOCUMENT ALREADY EXISTS..." ERROR MESSAGE</h2>
 
<P>
In this scenario, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   An unlocked subdocument already exists in another master document.

</PRE><h3>Cause</h3>
 
<P>
You inserted a subdocument twice in the same master document.
<P>
-or-
<P>
The subdocument you want to unlock is already unlocked in another open
master document.
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
A subdocument can be unlocked in only one master document at a time, so you
must do one or both of the following before you can unlock your
subdocument:

<UL><LI>Close the other master document.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If the subdocument is inserted twice in the current master document,
   lock both instances of the subdocument, and then unlock the one you want
   to edit or simply delete the unlocked version of the subdocument.
