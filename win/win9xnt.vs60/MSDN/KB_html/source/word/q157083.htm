<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists the graphics filters that are installed during a typical
setup of Word 97 or Office 97, the filters that are not installed, and the
filters that are native (built-in) to Word 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Graphics Filters Installed During Typical Setup</h3>
 
<P>
The following graphic filters are installed during a typical setup of
either Word 97 or Office 97. These filters convert graphics on import with
the exception of the WordPerfect Graphics/DrawPerfect and CompuServe GIF
converters. These two converters are used by the WordPerfect and the
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) text converters, respectively.

<UL><LI>Tagged Image File Format (TIFF)
<LI>Encapsulated PostScript (EPS)
<LI>WordPerfect Graphics/DrawPerfect (Imports WPG 1.0, 1.0e, and 2.0)
<LI>WordPerfect Graphics (Export only)
<LI>Macintosh PICT
<LI>CompuServe GIF (import/export) used by the HTML converter.
<P>
</UL><h3>Graphics Filters Not Installed During Typical Setup</h3>
 
<P>
The following graphics filters are not installed during a typical setup. To
install these filters, rerun the Setup program, click Add/Remove, and then
select the graphics filter you want. Unless otherwise noted, these filters
are supported by Word for Windows only.

<UL><LI>Truevision Targa import (.tga)
<LI>AutoCAD (.dxf)
<LI>Micrografx Designer/Draw (.drw)
<LI>CorelDraw (.cdr) versions 3.0, 4.0 5.0, 6.0
<LI>Computer Graphics Metafile (.cgm)
<LI>PC Paintbrush (.pcx)
<LI>Kodak Photo-CD (.pcd) - Windows and Macintosh
<P>
</UL><h3>Native (Built-in) Graphics Filters</h3>
 
<P>
Word can directly import and store the following graphics formats:

<UL><LI>Windows Bitmap (.bmp, .dib, .rle)
<LI>Windows Enhanced Metafile (.emf)
<LI>Windows Metafile (.wmf) - Windows only
<LI>JPEG File Interchange (.jpg)
<LI>Portable Network Graphics (.png)
<LI>Macintosh PICT - Macintosh only
<P>
</UL>Note that some of these filters can be installed during setup. In this case
the filters are not used by Word, but by other Office applications, such as
PowerPoint and PhotoEditor.
