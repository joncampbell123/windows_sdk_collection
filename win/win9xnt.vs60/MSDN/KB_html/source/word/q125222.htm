The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 6.0, 6.0.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You are unable to activate the numeric keypad using a Word command. This
functionality is changed from earlier versions of Word, which provided the
Numeric Lock command (Tools\Commands) to toggle the numeric keypad on non-
Apple keyboards.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
On Apple's keyboards, the NUM LOCK feature can be toggled on and off by
pressing SHIFT+NUM LOCK (clear).
<P>
Some non-Apple keyboards may also use this keystroke. However, some
keyboards (for instance, a model made by Kensington) may not accept this
keystroke. For assistance with Kensington or Key Tronic keyboards, contact:
<P>

   Key Tronic                           (800) 262-6006

<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Word 6.0.1 and Word 98 Macintosh Edition has the NUM LOCK on by default, 
though there is still no Numeric Lock command. You must still use the 
SHIFT+NUM LOCK (clear) keystroke to toggle NUM LOCK on and off.
