-----------------     ------          ----------

86, para 1,           Replace text    If you want Word to fix an
last sentence                         error, regardless of case,
                                      specify a lowercase entry. For
                                      example, "documetn" fixes
                                      "documetn," "Documetn," and
                                      "DOCUMETN." The entry
                                      "Documetn" fixes "Documetn"
                                      and "DOCUMETN," but not
                                      "documetn." The entry
                                      "DOCUMETN" fixes only the
                                      uppercase error.

86, para 2            Replace text    To see how the AutoCorrect

                                      Replace Text As You Type check

                                      menu. Type teh, press the
                                      SPACEBAR, and then watch Word
                                      replace it with "the."

                                      Word, you can save the
                                      template in the current
                                      version of Word. If you
                                      haven't changed the template,
                                      you can also save it in

                                      represented in the Word
                                      document as a rectangle

                                      which the graphic was created,

                                      For example, type "?" to
                                      indicate a question mark
                                      character instead of the
                                      question mark operator. Or
                                      type "modern dance" to
