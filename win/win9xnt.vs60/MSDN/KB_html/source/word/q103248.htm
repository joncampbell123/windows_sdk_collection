This article contains the text of "Installation Questions and
Answers," which is available on the Microsoft FastTips service for
Word for the Macintosh. It answers the most frequently asked questions
regarding the installation of Word version 5.0 for the Macintosh.

<PRE>1. Q. When I try to use the spelling checker, grammar checker,
      thesaurus, or the Find File command, one of the following error
      messages occurs in Word:

         The Spelling command is not installed.

         -or-

         The Grammar command is not installed.

         -or-

         The Find File command is not installed.

   A. In Word version 5.0, these error messages occur when Word cannot
      locate the folder where the commands are stored. This happens
      when the Word application and the Word Commands folder are not
      in the same folder. If this is the case, quit Word, move the two
      elements into the same folder, and then restart Word.

      These messages also appear if you change the name of the Word
      Commands folder or if the desktop file is damaged. If you
      suspect that the desktop is damaged, you can rebuild it by
      holding down COMMAND+OPTION while restarting the computer.

2. Q. What are the minimum system requirements for installing Word
      version 5.0 for the Macintosh?

   A. To run Word 5.0, you need the following:

       - Hardware: Macintosh Plus, SE, Classic, Classic II, LC,
         Portable, PowerBook, Quadra 700 or 900, or any of the
         Macintosh II series computers.

       - Storage: One 800K disk drive and a hard disk with at least 10
         megabytes (MB) of free disk space.

       - Memory: Minimum of 1 MB of memory. (2 MB is recommended; 2 MB
         is required if using System 7.0, the grammar checker, or
         MultiFinder; 4 MB is required if using the grammar checker
         and System 7.0.)

       - System Software: System version 6.0.2 or later, including
         System 7.0; Finder version 6.1 or higher.

      For more information, see page 11 in "Microsoft Word Getting
      Started."

3. Q. How do I install Word 5.0 for the Macintosh?

   A. To install Word 5.0, use the following three steps:

      1. Make sure no programs are running on your computer that might
         interfere with installation. Turn off startup programs
         (INITs) and remove virus protection programs such as
         Gatekeeper from your System folder. Then restart your
         computer.

      2. Insert the Install disk in the disk drive and double-click
         the Installer icon.

      3. Follow the instructions on the screen.

      For complete details on installing Word, see pages 11-14 of
      "Microsoft Word Getting Started."
