The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 3.0, 3.01, 3.02, 4.0,
   5.0, 5.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Automatic page breaks may appear in Microsoft Word documents for a
number of reasons. Below is a list of common causes; specific
definitions of the different formats are described in the "More
Information" section below:

<OL><P><LI>Word allows paragraph formats of "Page Break Before," "Keep With
   Next," and "Keep Lines Together."
<P>
   To see if a paragraph or a group of paragraphs have one or more of
   these formats, do the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      a. Select the paragraphs after the unexpected automatic page break.
</PRE>   
<P><PRE>      b. From the Format menu, choose Paragraph.
</PRE>   
<P><PRE>      c. If any of these formats is applied, their respective check boxes
<PRE></PRE>         will either be selected or unavailable.

   To remove the formatting, click the appropriate check box in step D
   above until it is clear.

</PRE><P><LI>A header or footer is defined to print a large distance from the
   top or bottom of the page. To check this, from the File Menu choose
   Document Layout and select the Margins tab (In Word 5.x from the
   Format menu choose Section). If the "Header/Footer From Top/From
   Bottom" measurement seems large, enter a smaller number.
<P>
   For example, if a header has been inserted in a document and the
   Section dialog box specifies that the header should print 10.75
   inches from the top margin, page breaks will occur after every line
   (assuming you have top and bottom margins set to 1 inch).

<P><LI>A header or footer that contains several blank returns can also
   cause this problem. To check this, choose Header or Footer from the
   View menu (Open Header/Open Footer from the Document menu in Word
   4.0).
<P>
   Because Word makes room for the Header and Footer, the main body of
   the document will contract to accomodate the Header or Footer. To
   correct the problem, open the Header/Footer and remove the extra
   paragraph returns and close the Header/Footer.

<P><LI>A small page size is defined for the document. To check this:
<P>
<P><PRE>      In Word 5.0 and 5.1, choose Preferences from the Tools menu.
      In Word 4.0, choose Preferences from the Edit menu.
      In Word 3.0x, choose Page Setup from the File menu.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      (Note: This only applies to Word 4.0 and 5.0 if an ImageWriter
      has been selected in the Chooser).
</PRE><P>
   Similarly, a large top and/or bottom margin can cause the same
   effect. To check this:
<P>
<P><PRE>      In Word 4.0, 5.0 and 5.1, choose Document from the Format menu.
      In Word 3.x, choose Page Setup from the File menu.
</PRE><P>
   For example, if you had a top margin of 6 inches and a bottom margin
   of 4 inches, you would be defining a 1-inch page (even if letter
   size paper is selected), causing the unwanted page breaks.

<P><LI>Paragraphs with the side-by-side paragraph format may be too long
   to fit on the current page. If any of a group of paragraphs
   formatted to be side-by-side has more lines than will fit on the
   current page, the whole group of paragraphs will be wrapped to the
   next page.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Page Break Before paragraph format places an automatic page break
before the first character of the formatted paragraph.
<P>
The Keep With Next paragraph format forces a paragraph to always be
placed on the same page as the following paragraph. If the next
paragraph falls on the next page, the paragraph formatted as Keep With
Next also moves to the next page. Word indicates this situation by
placing an automatic page break above the formatted paragraph if
appropriate.
<P>
The Keep Lines Together paragraph format prevents a paragraph from
having a page break fall in the middle of the paragraph. If a
paragraph formatted with this option occurs at the end of a page, Word
places the whole paragraph on the next page, and indicates this by
placing an automatic page break at the top of the paragraph.
<P>
Headers and footers allow you to enter text to appear at the top or
bottom of every page in a document. By default, they appear 0.5 inch
from the top and/or bottom of the page.
<P>
Page sizes are available for standard U.S. Letter (8.5 by 11 inches),
U.S. Legal (8.5 by 14 inches), A4 Letter (8.25 by 11.67 inches), and
B5 Letter (6.88 by 9.92 inches). In addition, Word allows custom paper
sizes as described above.
<P>
Page margins set the amount of default white space between the edges
of the page and the text of a document. Word's default margins are 1
inch for top and bottom and 1.25 inches for right and left.
<P>
The side-by-side paragraph format allows you to create successive
paragraphs that are aligned in columns. (Beginning with Word 4.0, you
can easily do this with tables.)
<P>
The Table feature in recent versions of Word allows you to create a
structure of rows and columns that contain normal text.
