The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,
   2.0c
<LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0 and 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOM</h2>
 
<P>
If you run Word for Windows over a PC-TCP network and open a document
that is already open at another workstation, the PC-TCP network may
display no message to notify you that the document is open elsewhere.
You can modify this document even though it is already open for
modification at another workstation.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
By default, the PC-TCP file-locking option is off. As a result,
multiple users can modify and save a Word document at the same time.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Turn on the PC-TCP file-locking option. When you turn on this option,
Word displays the following message when you try to open a document
that is already open in another instance of Word:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;filename&gt; is being used by another user. Do you want to make a copy?

</PRE>This affects your workstation only. To have all network users receive
the warning, be sure all users have the PC-TCP file-locking option
turned on.
<P>
