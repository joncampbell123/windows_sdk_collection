The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0. 6.0.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Setup to install Word for the Macintosh, Setup may repeatedly
prompt you to insert a specific disk, even though you already inserted the
correct disk in the disk drive.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are two main causes for this behavior. Case 1 below is the most
frequent cause.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1: Disk Volume Label Changed</h3>
 
<P>
You did not start your Macintosh without extensions, so an extension is
running that interferes with automatic disk ejection. (To start without
extensions, hold down the SHIFT key when you start the Macintosh. When you
see the message "Welcome to Macintosh Extensions Off," you can release the
SHIFT key.)
<P>
If your Macintosh does not eject the first Word Setup disk automatically
and you eject it manually using a paper clip, your computer retains the
internal volume label for the first disk (in this case, "Disk - 1 Setup").
When you insert the second disk, the computer changes the volume label for
that disk from "Disk - 2" to "Disk 1 - Setup." As a result, you no longer
have a disk with the label that Setup is requesting. Setup continues to
conclude that you inserted the wrong disk and continues to request the
correct disk.
<P>
If you ejected the first Word Setup disk by pressing COMMAND+SHIFT+1, Setup
may accept the disks you insert for awhile. Then, if Setup prompts you to
switch back and forth between two or more disks, it may mistakenly conclude
that you inserted the wrong disk in the disk drive. At that point, Setup
repeatedly requests the same disk, even though the correct disk is in the
disk drive.
<P>
If you now quit Setup and restart your Macintosh without extensions, the
problem recurs because the internal volume label on your Word disk has been
changed. In other words, none of your Word disks has the internal volume
label that Setup is requesting.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 2: Misaligned Floppy Disk Drive</h3>
 
<P>
Your floppy disk drive may be physically misaligned. In other words, this
is a hardware problem. This happens infrequently (it accounts for less than
5 percent of the reported instances of this problem).
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1: Rename the Internal Disk Volume</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Quit Word Setup.

<P><LI>Insert the disk that Setup will not accept in the disk drive.

<P><LI>Rename the disk volume to a different name. For example, change its name
   to "Wrong Disk" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Click on the hard disk name to exit edit-name mode. The internal disk
   label for your Word disk is now changed to the new name you typed, such
   as "Wrong Disk."

<P><LI>Click again on the Word Setup disk whose name you changed in steps 3 and
   4. Rename the disk volume to the correct name. For example, if it
   is Word Disk 2, change the name to "Disk - 2" (without the quotation
   marks).

<P><LI>Click on the hard disk name again to exit edit-name mode. The internal
   disk label of your Word disk is now correct.

<P><LI>Restart your Macintosh without extensions.

<P><LI>Run Word Setup. The problem should no longer occur.
<P>
</OL><h3>Case 2: Repair Your Floppy Disk Drive</h3>
 
<P>
If the workaround for Case 1 does not work, you may have a misaligned
floppy drive that needs to be repaired by your hardware service provider.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Setup program for Word
version 6.0 for the Macintosh. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
