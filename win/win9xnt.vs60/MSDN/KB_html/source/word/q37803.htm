<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Styles feature in Microsoft Word for Windows provides a higher
level of format control in addition to normal formatting procedures.
Essentially, the style that you apply to the current paragraph defines
the base paragraph settings.
<P>
There are two levels of format control: style formatting and manual
formatting. Style formatting is the formatting that remains if all
other formatting is removed. Manual formatting is formatting that is
in addition to or on top of the style formatting. Changing one level
of formatting does not change the other level.
<P>
If you apply formatting only through Styles, the formatting is
completely replaced when another style is applied to that paragraph.
However, if you apply manual formatting in addition to the style, the
manual formatting carries over when the style is redefined with the
new style.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Manual formatting commands do not turn off the current style, but add
to that style. For example, if you define a style containing Italic
formatting and apply it to a paragraph and you manually format some of
the text in this paragraph as Bold, that text becomes Italic and Bold.
If you apply a new style containing Underline rather than Italic to
that paragraph, the text in the paragraph becomes Underline and Bold.
<P>
Like character formatting, paragraph settings in a style determine the
default paragraph formatting. you can define styles that contain
settings for tab stops, indents, line spacing, and justification. If a
paragraph has a style applied containing paragraph settings and you
apply a different style, the paragraph settings defined in the first
style are completely replaced by the settings in the second style.
However, if there is additional paragraph formatting applied in
addition to the style, that formatting remains even after you apply a
different style.
<P>
For example, you define a style containing the settings for tab stops
at 1 inch and 4 inches. You type a paragraph and the text is arranged
in columns lined up at 1 and 4 inches. You define another style with
tab stops at 1.5 inches and 5 inches and apply this style to the
paragraph; the columns in the paragraph now line up at 1.5 and 5
inches. You manually place a tab stop on the ruler at 3.5 inches; now
the columns line up at 1.5 and 3.5 inches. If you reapply the original
style, with tab stops at 1 and 4 inches, to the paragraph, the columns
line up at 1 and 3.5 inches because the manually applied tab remains
on the ruler.
