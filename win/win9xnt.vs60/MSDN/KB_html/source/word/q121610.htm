The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Column-width measurements are permanently displayed on the ruler, or when
you set tab stops by clicking on the ruler, the ruler displays horizontal
lines and shows the distance to each margin.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are two potential causes of this problem:

<UL><LI>The right (secondary) mouse button is accidentally being activated along
   with the left (primary) button.

<LI>Word was installed when the Swap Left/Right Buttons option was activated
   and is using the mouse driver that shipped with Windows 3.1 or Windows
   for Workgroups 3.11. (To locate this option, open Control Panel and
   choose the Mouse icon.)
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If the right (secondary) mouse button is accidentally being activated, do
the following:

<UL><LI>Remove the bottom cover of the mouse and check for any debris that
   may be impairing the functionality of the mouse. Replace the cover
   and physically lift the right mouse button. This procedure usually
   resolves the problem.
<P>
</UL>If Word was installed when the Swap Left/Right Buttons option was
activated, do the following:

<UL><LI>Deactivate the Swap Left/Right Buttons option or upgrade to a later
   version of the Microsoft Mouse driver. (This problem has not been
   reproduced with the driver version 9.01 or later.)
<P>
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Word 6.0 for Windows, you can see the exact measurements of a text area
by holding down the ALT key and clicking the horizontal ruler.
