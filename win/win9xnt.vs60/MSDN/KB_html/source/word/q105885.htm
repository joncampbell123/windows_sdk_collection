The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Go To command in Microsoft Word, you cannot go from one 
subdocument (or document component) to a bookmark in another subdocument or 
the main body of the document. Similarly, you cannot go from the main body 
of a document to a bookmark in a subdocument. In other words, you cannot go 
from one layer of a document to a bookmark in another layer. The bookmark 
does not appear on the Bookmark Name list in the Edit Go To dialog boxes. 
In the Edit Bookmark dialog box, the Go To button is unavailable when you 
select a bookmark in another layer or subdocument.
<P>
NOTE: As used in this article, the word "subdocument" refers to document 
components and not to the documents in a master document. The main body of 
the document is what you can see in normal view. The following document 
elements are examples of subdocuments or document components: headers or 
footers, footnotes, endnotes, annotations, text boxes, or callouts.
<P>
<P><h3>Examples</h3>
 

<UL><LI>You cannot go from a header to a bookmark in a footnote, and you
   cannot go from the main body to a bookmark in the header.

<LI>If you create a text box (using the Text Box button on the Drawing
   toolbar) and then insert a bookmark in that text box, you cannot go
   to the bookmark unless you position the insertion point in the text
   box. If your insertion point is in the main body of the document or
   in any other layer of the document, you cannot go to the bookmark
   using the Go To command. In other words, you cannot go from the
   drawing layer in one subdocument to a bookmark in the drawing layer
   of the main body or another subdocument.
<P>
   You can, however, go from one text box in the drawing layer of the
   main body to a bookmark in another text box in the drawing layer of
   the main body because both text boxes are in the same layer of the
   same subdocument.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use the appropriate method for your situation.

<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/">http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/</A></B> 

</PRE><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Position the insertion point in the subdocument before you go to the
bookmark.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2 (Word 97 and Word 98)</h3>
 
<P>
Write a Visual Basic for Applications macro that checks for the existence 
of the bookmark and if it exists, goes to that bookmark. The following 
macro checks for and goes to the bookmark "test", if it exists:
<P>
<PRE>   If ActiveDocument.Bookmarks.Exists("test") = True Then
      ActiveDocument.Bookmarks("test").Select
   Else
      MsgBox "Specified bookmark does not exist."
   End If

</PRE><h3>Method 3 (Word 6 and Word 7)</h3>
 
<P>
Write a WordBasic macro that goes to the text box and searches for a
bookmark. The following macro searches for the first text box in the
document and locates the bookmark called "test."
<P>
<PRE>   Sub main
   DrawSetRange "\Doc"
   Select Case DrawGetType(1)
     Case 3   'Text box
        DrawSetInsertToTextbox 1
     Case 8   'Callout
        DrawSetInsertToTextbox 1
     Case Else
   End Select
   EditGoTo .Destination = "test"
   End Sub

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There is an exception to this behavior. If the insertion point is
in a header or footer when you click Go To on the Edit menu, Word
moves the insertion point into the body of the document and returns it
to the last position before you switched to the header or footer. This
means you cannot go to a bookmark in the header or footer using the Go
To command on the Edit menu. This does not happen when you use the
Bookmark command on the Edit menu and click Go To; the insertion point 
stays in the header or footer and you can go to your bookmark, as expected.
<P>
<P><h3>Visual Basic for Applications Example</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Sub FindBookmark()
      ActiveWindow.ActivePane.View.Type = wdPageView
      ActiveWindow.View.SeekView = wdSeekCurrentPageHeader
      ActiveDocument.Bookmarks("test").Select
   End Sub

</PRE><h3>WordBasic Example</h3>
 
<P>
The following macro opens the Header/Footer and goes to the suggested
bookmark.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Main
      ViewHeader(Footer)
      EditBookmark .Name="test", Goto
   End Sub
