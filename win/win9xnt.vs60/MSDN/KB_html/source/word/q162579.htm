The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Word 97 does not retain the scaling (size) information for a linked
graphic. That is, the graphic reverts to its original size (100 percent).
<P>
NOTE: This also applies to other linked embedded objects.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when all of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The "Link to file" check box is selected (the check box has a mark in
   it).
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The "Save with document" check box is not selected (the check box is
   clear).
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, install Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1 (SR-
1).
<P>
Use one of the following methods to work around the problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Use This Method When Inserting New Graphics</h3>
 
<P>
Enable the "Save with document" check box when you insert the graphic by
following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Insert menu, point to Picture, and then click From File.

<P><LI>In the Insert Picture dialog box, select the desired graphic.

<P><LI>Click the "Link to file" and "Save with document" check boxes so
   both have check marks. Then, click OK.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: This means that the graphic is stored in the Word document as opposed
to being stored outside of the file only. The size of the file will be
larger. This does not cause the file size to grow as much as it did in
earlier versions of Word. The new graphic compression feature keeps the
file size much smaller. To test this, create a document in an earlier
version of Word and include several screen shots. Save it and note the
size. Create a similar document in Word 97 and note the size--it will be
much smaller compared to size of the file created an earlier version of
Word.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Use This Method to Correct Graphics in Existing Documents</h3>
 
<P>
Use this method to correct existing graphics in existing documents.

<OL><P><LI>Open the document.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click the View tab.

<P><LI>Enable the Field Codes check box.

<P><LI>Look in the document for INCLUDEPICTURE field codes.

<P><LI>For each INCLUDEPICTURE field code, locate and delete the "\d" switch.

<P><LI>With your insertion point still inside the field code, press the
   F9 key on your keyboard to update the field.

<P><LI>Save and Close the document.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: In place of steps 2-7 above, you can run the following macro:
<P>
Dim ofield As Object
<PRE>   Sub FindField()
       ActiveWindow.View.ShowFieldCodes = True
       For Each ofield In ActiveDocument.Fields
           ofield.Select
           If ofield.Type = "67" Then 'INCLUDEPICTURE field
               With Selection.Find
                  .MatchWholeWord = True
                  .MatchSoundsLike = False
                  .MatchWildcards = False
                  .MatchAllWordForms = False
                  .Execute findtext:=" \d ", replacewith:=" ", _
                   replace:=True
                   .Wrap = wdFindStop
               End With
               ofield.Update
           End If
       Next ofield
       ActiveWindow.View.ShowFieldCodes = False
   End Sub

<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for
Windows. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Word 97 SR-1.
<P>
For additional information about SR-1, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : OFF97: How to Obtain and Install MS Office 97 SR-1

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you link a picture in Word 97 with the "Link to file" option in the
Insert Picture dialog box, any changes you make to the size of the graphic
will not be retained when the file is saved, closed, and reopened.
<P>
This problem only occurs when the "Save with document" check box is not
selected.
<P>
NOTE: This problem is not influenced by cropping the graphic or selecting
the "Float over text" check box.
