The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,
   2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how you can number the pages of a section in the
following format:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;Page Number&gt; of &lt;Total Number of Pages in Section&gt;

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This numbering sequence is implemented differently depending on the
version of Word for Windows you are using. Follow the directions
that correspond to the version you have installed as follows:
<P>
<P><h3>Word 7.x, 97</h3>
 
<P>
In Word 7.x or Word 97, use "Page {page} of {SectionPages}" (without
the quotation marks). Unlike its behavior in Word 6.x, the SectionPages
field is fully implemented and works as expected within the header or
footer of a document.
<P>
For additional information about the SectionPages field, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../word/q159678.htm">Q159678</A></B>
   TITLE     : WD97: Incorrect SectionPages Result w/Background Printing

</PRE><h3>Word 6.x</h3>
 
<P>
Word 6.x ships with the SectionPages field, which returns the total
number of pages in a section. However, the SectionPages field is not
fully implemented and does not return the correct number of pages in a
section if you insert the field in the header or footer. To return the
number of pages in a section in Word 6.x, use the steps described in
the next section.
<P>
For more information on the SectionPages field, query in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base on the following word:
<P>
<PRE>   SectionPages

</PRE>Word 2.x
 
<P>
Use the PAGEREF field to obtain the number of pages in the current
section. The following instructions insert page numbers in the header
or footer of your document. Page numbering starts at 1 for each
section, and the PAGEREF field yields the number of pages in each
section. Page numbering appears as "Page X of Y" on each page, where
X is the current page in the current section, and Y is the number of
pages in the current section.

<OL><P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Page Numbers.

<P><LI>Select the desired Position and Alignment settings, and then choose
   the Format button.

<P><LI>Select the Start At option (1 should appear in the Start At list),
   and then choose OK.

<P><LI>Repeat the following instructions in each section of your document
   to insert a bookmark at the end of the section:
<P>
   a. Select some text at the end of the last page of the section.
<P>
   b. From the Edit menu, choose Bookmark.
<P>
   c. Type a Bookmark Name, and then choose the Add button.

<P><LI>In the header or footer for the section, position the insertion
   point after the PAGE field you inserted in steps 1 through 3 above,
   and insert the following field and text (include the space before
   "of")
<P>
<P><PRE>      of {PAGEREF BookmarkName}
</PRE><P>
   where BookmarkName is the name of the bookmark you inserted at the
   end of the current section.
<P>
   In field code view, the header or footer appear as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      { PAGE  } of { PAGEREF BookmarkName }
</PRE><P>
   For example, if the current section contains 11 pages, the following
   appears in the header or footer on page 3:
<P>
<P><PRE>      3 of 11
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Word 1.x</h3>
 
<P>
In Word versions 1.x, there is a problem with the method described for
Word version 2.x above. When you insert the PAGEREF field in the header
or footer, its result is the current page number instead of the number
of the page where the bookmark is located. As a result, you must use
the one of the following methods in Word versions 1.x:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Lock the PAGEREF Field</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Perform steps 1 through 4 of the instructions for Word version 2.0
   above.

<P><LI>Select the PAGEREF field in the header or footer and update it by
   pressing F9.

<P><LI>Lock the PAGEREF field by pressing CTRL+F11 (or ALT+CTRL+F1).
<P>
   Note: If you later add pages to the section, you can update the
   PAGEREF field by doing the following:
<P>
   a. Unlock the PAGEREF field by selecting it and pressing
<P><PRE>      SHIFT+CTRL+F11 (or ALT+SHIFT+CTRL+F1).
</PRE><P>
   b. Repeat steps 2 and 3 above.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Use a SET Field</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Select some text at the end of the last page of the section.

<P><LI>Insert a SET field that assigns a unique bookmark name to the page
   number of the last section. The following is the syntax of the SET
   field:
<P>
<P><PRE>      {SET BookmarkName {PAGE}}
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the View menu, be sure the Page command has no check mark. If
   this command does have a check mark, choose Page to switch to Normal
   view.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Header/Footer.

<P><LI>Click the Options button.

<P><LI>In the Start At box, type 1.

<P><LI>Change the Start At field to 1.

<P><LI>Select Header or Footer and then choose the OK button.

<P><LI>In the header/footer pane, insert the following fields and text:
<P>
<P><PRE>      {PAGE} of {BookmarkName \* charformat}.
