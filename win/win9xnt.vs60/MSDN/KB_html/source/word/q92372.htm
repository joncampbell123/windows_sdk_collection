<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Graph from Word for the Macintosh, the following error
message sometimes appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Graph is not available or is busy. Quit and return from
   Graph if it is already running.

</PRE>This error message occurs under the following conditions:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Graph is already running in the background.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Microsoft Graph has been removed from your hard disk.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Word cannot locate the Microsoft Graph application.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The system hasn't registered the program.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>There is not enough available memory.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The Embedding Preferences file has been corrupted
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Graph Is Already Running in the Background</h3>
 
<P>
If you previously started Microsoft Graph and then switched back to
Word without exiting Graph, the above error message occurs if you try
to start Graph from Word. If Microsoft Graph is already running, use
the Finder menu to return to Graph. When you want to return to Word,
choose Quit And Return from the File menu in Graph.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Graph Has Been Removed from Your Hard Disk</h3>
 
<P>
If Microsoft Graph has been removed from your hard disk, use the disks
supplied with Word for the Macintosh to run the Installer program.
When you run the Installer, select the Custom Installation option to
reinstall Microsoft Graph.
<P>
<P><h3>Word Cannot Locate the Microsoft Graph Application</h3>
 
<P>
The above error may occur if the Finder is unable to locate the
application (even though Microsoft Graph is correctly installed in the
Word Commands folder). In this case, you must rebuild the desktop to
update the Finder so it can locate Microsoft Graph. To rebuild the
desktop, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Exit all applications and shut down your Macintosh (from the
   Special menu, choose Shut Down).

<P><LI>Restart your Macintosh and press COMMAND+OPTION while the machine
   restarts. Choose the OK button when the following message appears:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Are you sure you want to rebuild the desktop file on the disk
      "&lt;Hard Disk Name&gt;"? Comments in info windows will be lost.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Restart Word and choose the Graph button on the toolbar to start
   Microsoft Graph.
<P>
</OL><h3>The System Hasn't Registered the Program</h3>
 
<P>
The error message can be caused even though Microsoft Graph is installed
and in the correct folder if the system hasn't registered the program.
To force Microsoft Word to register Microsoft Graph:

<OL><P><LI>From the Desktop open the Word Commands folder.

<P><LI>Double click on the Microsoft Graph folder.

<P><LI>Double click on Microsoft Graph application. The following message will
   be returned:
<P>
<P><PRE>      You can only run Microsoft Graph from within another progam Quit Now?
</PRE><P>
   Choose yes and you will be returned to the Microsoft Graph folder.
<P>
</OL>When return to Word, you should be able to run Microsoft Graph.
<P>
<P><h2>There is not Enough Available Memory</h2>
 
<P>
Increase the amount of available memory for Word.

<OL><P><LI>Quit Word.

<P><LI>In the Finder, select the Microsoft Word application program file.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Get Info.

<P><LI>Under Memory Requirements, change the Preferred Size to 3000K (under
   Macintosh System 7.0, change the Current Size setting under Memory).

<P><LI>Close the Get Info Window.

<P><LI>Start Word.
<P>
</OL><h2>The Embedding Preferences File has been Corrupted</h2>
 
<P>
Remove the existing Preferences files and re-register Graph.

<OL><P><LI>Quit Word.

<P><LI>Open the System Folder.

<P><LI>Open the Preferences Folder.

<P><LI>Drag the Embedding Preferences folder into the trash icon.

<P><LI>Restart Word and double click the Graph icon to re-register Graph.
