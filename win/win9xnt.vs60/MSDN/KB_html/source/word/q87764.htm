The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,
   2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c
<LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0 and 3.1
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains troubleshooting information specific to
Microsoft Word for Windows. You can use this information in addition
to normal software troubleshooting techniques if you have a problem
with Word for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Rename NORMAL.DOT</h3>
 
<P>
Word for Windows uses the NORMAL.DOT template file to establish the
default styles, macros, key assignments, menus items, tool bar
choices, glossaries, and boilerplate text. Because NORMAL.DOT is a
global file, it can cause problems in every Word for Windows session
and every new file if it is corrupted. If you exit Word for Windows,
rename NORMAL.DOT, and restart the program, all default Word settings
are restored.
<P>
Note: NORMAL.DOT contains many useful settings that must be re-created
if the file is corrupted. Be sure to rename the file back to
"NORMAL.DOT" if you discover that NORMAL.DOT is not the source of the
problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Rename WINWORD.INI</h3>
 
<P>
Word for Windows uses the WINWORD.INI file to store the most recent
settings, such as window size and user information. As with
NORMAL.DOT, corruption in WINWORD.INI can affect many aspects of your
Word for Windows session. Word rebuilds this file whenever you exit
the program; therefore, you do not need to rename the file back to
"WINWORD.INI." If this file is deleted, Word opens with the original
default settings.
<P>
<P><h3>Switch to a Different Printer Driver</h3>
 
<P>
Unlike many Windows-based applications, Word for Windows uses the
printer driver for numerous tasks because its primary concern is the
printed appearance of the document. When you are printing or viewing a
document, problems with printer drivers can cause Word for Windows to
display the document incorrectly on the screen, generate incorrect
printed output, or even hang Word. By using a different printer
driver, you can determine if the problem is related to the printer
driver.
<P>
If your Word for Windows documents print as garbled output, you may
need to disable the Fast Printing Direct To Port setting in the
Microsoft Windows Control Panel. To do this, choose the Printers icon
in Control Panel and choose the Connect button. In the Connect dialog
box, clear the Fast Printing Direct To Port check box and choose the
OK button. When this option is disabled, Windows version 3.1 prints
using standard MS-DOS interrupts instead of printing directly to the
port. For more information on the Fast Printing Direct to Port
setting, see pages 30, 32, and 426-429 of the "Microsoft Windows
Resource Kit for Operating System Version 3.1," or query on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ms-dos and directly and fast and printing and port and panel

</PRE><h3>Switch to a Different Printer Driver in Windows Write</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Windows Write and Word for Windows use printer drivers
similarly. Both applications get most of their information from the
printer driver; therefore, Write and Word often produce the same
results when the printer driver is causing problems.
<P>
Note: Word exploits more features of the printer driver than Write;
therefore, Write is not an exhaustive test for all printer driver
problems.
<P>
<P><h3>Check the File Size and Dates of the OLE DLL Files</h3>
 
<P>
DLL files are used by Word for Windows (and other OLE applications)
during object linking and embedding. Old, outdated versions of DLL
files should not be used with Word for Windows. Reinstall these files
if you suspect they are out of date or corrupt. The DLL files that
ship with Word for Windows are for use with Microsoft Windows
operating system version 3.0. Updated DLL files are available from Windows
3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Check the Following Sections in WIN.INI</h3>
 

<UL><LI>[Microsoft Word 2.0] - versions 2.0, 2.0a, and 2.0a-CD only
<LI>[MS Word Text Converters] - versions 2.0, 2.0a, and 2.0a-CD only
<LI>[MS Word Editable Sections] - versions 2.0, 2.0a, and 2.0a-CD only
<LI>[Microsoft Word] - versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.1a only
<LI>[WWFilters] - versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.1a only
<P>
</UL>For information on the settings in these WIN.INI sections:

<UL><LI>Refer to pages 396-397 in the "Microsoft Word for Windows User's
   Reference" for version 1.x.

   for version 2.0.
