The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, Service Release 1 (SR-1)
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Word 97, when you open a document that contains graphics, some of the
graphics are displayed as partial or whole red "X"s.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs most often with inserted bitmap (.bmp) files or pasted
graphics. Note, however, that this behavior may also occur with other
graphics formats.
<P>
Word uses either a red "X" or a general picture (a circle, square, and
triangle) to represent any graphic or picture it cannot display. Word will
not be able to display corrupted or damaged graphics or may lose picture
data in low memory or low resource situations.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
In most cases, you can resolve this problem by upgrading to Microsoft Word
Service Release 1 (SR-1). For information about how to upgrade to SR-1,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../word/q172527.htm">Q172527</A></B>
   TITLE     : WD97: How to Obtain Word 97 for Windows Service Release 1

</PRE>If you have installed SR-1 and you continue to have red "X" problems,
please see the "If You Have Installed SR-1 But Continue to See a Red 'X'"
section of this article.
<P>
Once you have installed SR-1, you will need to manually restore the
graphics in the document. Note that you can also use these steps as a
temporary workaround if you are unable to install SR-1.
<P>
To manually restore the graphics in a document, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options, and click the Save tab.

<P><LI>Click to clear the Allow Fast Saves check box.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As and save the document with a new name.
   Restore the graphics in this new document and use this new version of
   the document from now on.

<P><LI>Use the following methods to determine the nature of the problem and
   restore the graphics.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 1: Verify Sufficient Free Space on Your Primary Hard Disk</h3>
 
<P>
Follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Double-click My Computer on the desktop.

<P><LI>Right-click your primary hard disk (for example drive C).

<P><LI>Click Properties. The amount of free disk space should be approximately
   20 megabytes (MB) or more.
<P>
</OL>There is no specific minimum amount of free disk space required to run
Office programs. However, most computers do require a certain amount of
free space (usually around 20 MB) to open, close, and save files, and to
print documents.
<P>
If your hard disk has less than 20 MB of free disk space available, you
should consider removing unused data files or temporary files or programs.
After you have freed 20 MB or more space on your primary hard disk, restart
Windows, and re-open the file.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Replace the Graphic from the Original Source File</h3>
 
<P>
Follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Delete the red "X" from the document.

<P><LI>On the Insert Menu, point to Picture, and click From File.

<P><LI>Select the original graphics file and click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 3: Open the Picture in Picture Editor, Paste It Back in the Document</h3>
 
<P>
Follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Double-click the picture to open it in the picture editor.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Select All.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Copy.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click "Close &amp; Return to document."

<P><LI>In Word, click Paste on the Edit Menu.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 4: Refresh the Field Results</h3>
 
<P>
If the graphic is linked, you can refresh the field results. For example,
when you view field codes, if you see a field that resembles either of the
following
<P>
<PRE>   {IMPORT c:\\clipart\\picture.pcx}

   -or-

   {INCLUDEPICTURE c:\\clipart\\picture.pcx}

</PRE></OL>make sure that Picture.pcx file does exist in the Clipart folder. Then,
select the field and press F9 to update the field.
<P>
Updating the field will cause the graphics filter to read the picture
again. When this occurs, the picture display should be refreshed and the
red "X" will be replaced with the expected picture.
<P>
<P><h2>IF YOU HAVE INSTALLED SR-1 BUT CONTINUE TO SEE A RED "X"</h2>
 
<P>
In some cases, a red "X" is displayed in your document on purpose. An image
can be displayed as a red "X" if any of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The Image is a GIF or JPEG image that contains complex formatting
   options such as animations, sounds, or progressive displays.

<LI>The directory specified as a temporary directory in Windows does not
   exist.

<LI>The image has been corrupted or some other aspect of the document has
   been corrupted.

<LI>You have insufficient free space on your hard disk.
<P>
</UL>To determine whether the nature of the graphic in your document is causing
the display problem, use the following methods.
<P>
Note that documents created in the pre-SR-1 release of Microsoft Word 97
for Windows will continue to display red "X"s until you repair the
graphics. That is, the damaged graphics are not corrected automatically
when you install SR-1. In these cases, use the steps and methods in the
"Resolution" section of this article to recover the missing graphics.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: If the Image is a GIF or JPEG Image</h3>
 
<P>
Many JPEG or GIF images downloaded from the Internet contain complex
formatting options such as animations, sounds, or progressive displays.
Word does not use these options. To modify the graphic so that it
includes only those elements that Word will use, use a graphics editing
program to save the graphic in a simpler format:

<UL><LI>For a GIF graphic, lower the complexity to CIS GIF 87 or 87A rather than
   GIF 89A.

<LI>For a JPEG graphic, save it in the "simple" or "baseline" format,
   without any progressive redraw features.
<P>
</UL>For more information about these graphics formats, see the documentation
that comes with your graphics editing program and see the "More
Information" section of this article.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Verify That You Are Using a Valid Temp Directory</h3>
 
<P>
Verify that the SET TEMP and SET TMP lines in your Autoexec.bat file are
pointing to valid folders. To verify the SET TEMP and SET TMP lines in
the Autoexec.bat file, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, and then click Run.

<P><LI>In the Run box, type "sysedit" (without the quotation marks) and click
   OK.
<P>
   This command will open the System Configuration Editor.

<P><LI>Click the Autoexec.bat window.

<P><LI>In the Autoexec.bat file, look for a line beginning with SET TEMP or 
   SET TMP. These lines if they exist, should be set equal to a valid 
   directory. Make note of any directory referenced. 
   NOTE: (If the Autoexec.bat file does not contain a line that starts 
   with either of these commands, skip to the next method.)

<P><LI>Click the Start menu and click Windows Explorer or Windows NT Explorer.

<P><LI>In Windows Explorer, verify that the directory you noted in step 4 is a
   valid directory.
<P>
</OL>If you are running Windows NT, also check the following:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, click System, and click the Environment tab.

<P><LI>On the Environment Tab, check the values for TEMP and TMP under User
   Variables. These values will be the path to a directory. Note the
   directory listed.

<P><LI>In Windows NT Explorer, verify that the directory noted in step 3 is a
   valid directory. If the TMP setting is using wildcards (% signs),
   create a directory called TMP in two places: C:\tmp and C:\winnt\Tmp.
<P>
   NOTE: If you are running Windows NT version 4.0, ensure that you have
   Service Pack 3 (SP3) installed. This resolves a problem where the SET
   TMP in user variables can be accidentally reset.
<P>
</OL>For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      TITLE     : How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack

</PRE></OL><h3>Method 3: Verify That Your Graphic File Is Not Damaged or Corrupted</h3>
 
<P>
If you see a partial re-draw of the picture before it becomes a red "X" or
if the size of your graphic is not what you expect, the graphic may be
corrupted.
<P>
To see the size of your graphic, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the picture to select it.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, click Picture.

<P><LI>In the Format Picture dialog box, click the Size tab.

<P><LI>Verify the size of the picture using the numbers under Original Size
   near the bottom of the dialog box.
<P>
</OL>If the size reported is not what you expect the intact picture to be, the
graphic file may be corrupted. If the size reported is 1 inch-by-1 inch,
there is a different problem and you’ll need to try some other workarounds
to resolve the problem.
<P>
To restore the picture, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the picture in a graphics editing program such as Photo Editor.

<P><LI>Save the file in a different file format.

<P><LI>Attempt to insert the saved file back into your document.
<P>
</OL>In some cases, a red "X" in your document indicates that some other aspect
of the document has been corrupted. If you receive an "unable to open file"
error message or if you receive an invalid page fault (IPF) when you open
the file, some other aspect of your document may be damaged.
<P>

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Information About GIF and JPEG File Formats</h3>
 
<P>
Graphics interchange format (GIF) is the most common file format for
graphic images on the World Wide Web. The next most common format is
Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) format.
<P>
GIF:
<P>
GIF uses the two-dimensional raster data type, is encoded in binary, and
uses a type of compression called LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch). There are two
versions of the format, 87a and 89a. Version 89a lets users save an
animated GIF, which is essentially a short sequence of images within a
single GIF file. You can also save interlaced images in GIF89a format.
<P>
JPEG:
<P>
Essentially JPEG has two basic types: progressive and simple. A simple or
"baseline" JPEG file is one top-to-bottom scan of the image. Progressive
JPEG divides the file into a series of scans so that the image quality
increases as each scan is loaded.
<P>
This has obvious advantages for images downloaded over low bandwidth
connections. (Basically, progressive JPEG is just a rearrangement of the
same data into a more complicated order.)
<P>
