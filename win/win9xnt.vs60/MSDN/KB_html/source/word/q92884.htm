</PRE><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
The Word 5.1a Patcher included on the enclosed MW0711 disk is for use
with Microsoft Word for the Macintosh version 5.1. This program
corrects a problem with Word 5.1 that occurs when you fast save a
document that contains footers and/or headers. This problem causes the
footers and/or headers to disappear in the last section (or only
section) of a document.
<P>
The Word 5.1a Patcher corrects the Word program and identifies your
version as Word 5.1a rather than Word 5.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Running the Patcher</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>If you are running Word, choose Quit from the File menu.

<P><LI>Insert the MW0711 disk in the disk drive.

<P><LI>Copy the file called Word 5.1a Patcher to the folder on your hard
   disk drive that contains the Microsoft Word version 5.1 program.
<P>
<P><PRE>    Note: If you are running Gatekeeper, you must disable it before
    running the patcher.  To do this, choose Control Panels from the
    Apple menu, double-click the Gatekeeper pane, select On/Off, and
    click the Off switch.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Open the Word 5.1 folder and double-click the Word 5.1a Patcher
   icon.

<P><LI>Read the information displayed and choose the OK button.

   button. The patcher will run and correct the error in Word. The
   patcher won't affect any other portions of the Word program.
