<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to use the STYLEREF field. The STYLEREF field
can be used to create dictionary-style entries at the top of each page or
to place the chapter title in the heading. This field is useful when you
want text in the header to match what is typed on the page.
<P>
The STYLEREF field is a specialized reference field designed to let you add
information to a document, especially in the header or footer,
automatically.
<P>
The STYLEREF field consists of the field, the name of the style assigned to
the text to be returned as the result of the field, and field switches.
<P>
<PRE>   {STYLEREF "StyleName" \* MERGEFORMAT}
   {STYLEREF "StyleName" &lt;switches&gt; \* MERGEFORMAT}

   NOTE: The name of the style must be enclosed in quotation marks
   to work properly.

</PRE>Word will search the page from top to bottom (by default) for the nearest
paragraph formatted with the style specified in the STYLEREF field. Word
will then return that text formatted with the designated style in the
location of the field.
<P>
<P><h3>STYLEREF Field Switches</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE> \l - Inserts the last text formatted with the style on the current page
      instead of the first text formatted with this style. Word searches
      the page from bottom to top.

      The \l switch will only work correctly in headers and footers.

 \n - Causes the field to display the entire paragraph number for a
      referenced paragraph without trailing periods. No information about
      prior levels is displayed unless it is included as part of the
      current level. For example, caption numbering is included if caption
      numbering has been applied to the paragraph.

 \p - Causes the field to display its position relative to the source
      bookmark using the word "above" or "below." If the STYLEREF field
      appears in the document before the bookmark, it evaluates to "below."
      If the STYLEREF field appears after the bookmark, it evaluates to
      "above." If the STYLEREF field appears within the bookmark, an error
      is returned.

 \r - Inserts the entire paragraph number of the bookmarked paragraph in
      relative context, or relative to the paragraph numbering scheme,
      without trailing periods.

 \t - When used with the \n, \r, or \w switch, causes the STYLEREF field to
      suppress nondelimiter, or nonnumerical, text. With this switch, for
      example, you can reference "Section 1.01," and only "1.01" is
      displayed in the result.

 \w - Inserts the paragraph number of the bookmarked paragraph in full
      context, from anywhere in the document. For example, when referencing
      paragraph "ii.," a STYLEREF field with the \w switch would return
      "1.a.ii" as a result.

</PRE>The STYLEREF field is most often used in headers and footers. The examples
in the "Examples" section of this article illustrate the possible uses of
the STYLEREF field.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Insert a STYLEREF Field</h3>
 
<P>
Method 1: To create a field using the menus, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Position the insertion point in the document where you want to insert
   the text to be entered.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Field.

<P><LI>In the Categories list box, select "Links and References."

<P><LI>In the Field Names list, select "StyleRef."

<P><LI>Click Options and then click the Styles tab. Select the style defined by
   your text that you want to be displayed as the field result and then
   click Add to Field.

<P><LI>Type quotation marks around the style name.

<P><LI>If a field switch is desired, click the Field Specific Switches tab.
   Select the desired switch, click Add To Field, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>To view the field code you just inserted, press ALT+F9 (Windows) or
OPTION+F9 (Macintosh).
<P>
Method 2: To Create a field using keystrokes

<OL><P><LI>Position the insertion point in the document where you want to insert
   the text.

<P><LI>Press CTRL+F9 (Windows) or COMMAND+F9 (Macintosh).
<P>
   Field code brackets, {}, will appear in the document.

<P><LI>Type the following inside the field code brackets, where &lt;stylename&gt; is
   the name of the style applied to the text that you want to be displayed:
<P>
<PRE>                STYLEREF "&lt;stylename&gt;"

   NOTE: You must enclose the style name in quotation marks.

</PRE></OL><h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Using STYLEREF Fields to Create a Dictionary Type Entry</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: This example will only work if the field indicated below is in either
the header or footer of the document.
<P>
Use the STYLEREF field when you want to create the same format you'll find
in a dictionary at the top of the page, for example, BEGINNING WORD--LAST
WORD.
<P>
For example, if you have the word Apple at the top of your document and the
word Baseball at the bottom of the document and they are both formatted
with a Heading 2 style, you can enter fields into the header and/or footer
to give a result of:
<P>
<PRE>   Apple--Baseball

</PRE>To produce this effect, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the header or footer of the document, enter the following fields by
   do the following:
<P>
   a. Click Header and Footer on the View menu.
<P>
   b. Press CTRL+F9 (Windows) or COMMAND+F9 (Macintosh) to enter the first
<P><PRE>      set of field code braces {}.
</PRE>   
</OL>2. Type STYLEREF "Heading 2" into the field braces.

<OL><P><LI>Move the insertion point outside the right field brace and press the
   hyphen key twice. Then Press CTRL+F9 (Windows) or COMMAND+F9
   (Macintosh) to enter the second set of field code braces {}.

<P><LI>Type STYLEREF "Heading 2" \l into the field braces.
<P>
</OL>The final entry will resemble the following:
<P>
<PRE>      {STYLEREF "Heading 2"}--{STYLEREF "Heading 2" \l}

</PRE></OL>The result of these fields will be:
<P>
<PRE>      Apple - Baseball (where Apple and Baseball have been formatted with
                        Heading 2 style)

</PRE><h3>Case 2--Chapter Title to Appear in the Header</h3>
 
<P>
Use this format to insert the current chapter name as part of the header or
footer.
<P>
If the title of the current chapter is File Management and that title is
formatted with a Heading 1 style and if you place the field below into the
header
<P>
<PRE>      {STYLEREF "Heading 1"}

</PRE>the result of the field in the header will be:
<P>
<PRE>      File Management

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Effective Use of the STYLEREF field</h3>
 
<P>
To use the STYLEREF field effectively, you need to understand how Word
determines which paragraph is the nearest one. That determination depends
on where the STYLEREF field is and on whether the /l (the letter L) switch
is being used.
<P>
<PRE>   If STYLEREF
   Is here            Word will search here
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Document text      The closest text preceding the STYLEREF field. If the
                      style isn't found, Word searches for the closest
                      following text.

   Footnotes,         The closest text preceding the footnote, annotation,
   annotations,       or endnote reference mark in the document text.
   and endnotes       If the style isn't found, Word searches for the
                      closest text following the reference mark.

   Headers and        The current page, from top to bottom. If the style
   Footers            isn't found, Word searches next from the top of the
   (during printing)  page to the beginning of the document, and then from
                      the bottom of the page to the end of the document.
                      If the \l switch is used, Word searches from the
                      bottom of the page to the beginning or end of the
                      document.

   Headers and        The section that contains the STYLEREF field, from
   Footers            the beginning. If the style isn't found, Word
   (when not          searches from the end of the section to the end of
   printing)          the document.

Assistant, type "styleref," click Search, and then click "Field codes:
StyleRef field."
