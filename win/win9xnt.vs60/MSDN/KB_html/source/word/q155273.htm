The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
</UL> 
<P>
<PRE>                                  SUMMARY
                                  =======

</PRE>This article describes how to print envelopes correctly from Word to the
Apple LaserWriter 16/600, with both the Envelope And Labels dialog box and
the Mail Merge feature of Word.
<P>
<PRE>                             MORE INFORMATION
                             ================

</PRE><h3>Configuring the Printer Driver</h3>
 
<P>
The Apple LaserWriter 16/600 can use any of several different base printer
drivers, but the recommended driver is:

<UL><LI>Apple LaserWriter printer driver version 8.0 or later
<P>
</UL>The following driver will not work in this scenario:

<UL><LI>Apple LaserWriter printer driver version 7.x
<P>
</UL>To configure the printer driver:

<OL><P><LI>On the Apple menu, click Chooser.

<P><LI>Locate the printer driver for your LaserWriter and select it.

<P><LI>Select the printer in the "Select a &lt;Printer Driver Name&gt; Printer" list.

<P><LI>Click Setup.

<P><LI>Click Auto Setup. Click OK.
<P>
   The PPD will automatically be selected for you.
<P>
   NOTE: If you get a warning message that the correct PPD cannot be
   located, make sure that you have the PPD for your printer in the Printer
   Descriptions folder (either in the System folder or in the Extensions
   folder).

<P><LI>Click Configure.

<P><LI>Click Envelope Feeder and from the list, select Installed. There may be
   other settings in this dialog box. Choose the correct settings for your
   printer. Click OK, and then click OK again.
<P>
   NOTE: If you do not know certain items of your printers configuration,
   the Printer Info button in the Printer Setup dialog may provide the
   information. The dialog box lists whether or not certain options are
   installed, including the types of networks supported and how much memory
   is installed in the printer.

<P><LI>Close the Chooser.
<P>
</OL><h3>Setting the Printer Heuristic in Word</h3>
 
<P>
Word has a setting (called a printer heuristic) that forces the Page Setup
dialog box to appear after you click the Print button in the Envelopes
dialog box. This dialog box allows you to set the paper size to that of an
envelope so that the printer will use the envelope feeder when you send the
print job.
<P>
NOTE: You need set this heuristic only once for your selected printer. You
do not need to set the heuristic each time you print an envelope.
<P>
To set this heuristic:

<OL><P><LI>In Word, click Macro on the Tools menu.

<P><LI>Type "ToolsAdvancedSettings" (without the quotation marks). Click Run.

<P><LI>In the Advanced Settings dialog box, select your printer from the
   Categories list. (It should be something like LaserWriter 8.0 or
   LaserWriter 8.1.1)

<P><LI>Press the TAB key to select the text in the Option text box. Delete the 
   text (if any) and type "Flags" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Press the TAB key to select the text in the Setting text box. Delete the 
   text and type "132" (without the quotation marks). Then, click Set and 
   click OK.

<P><LI>Quit Word and then restart Word. (The setting is not saved until you
   quit Word.)
<P>
</OL><h3>Setting Up the Optional Envelope Feeder</h3>
 
<P>
With the envelope feeder installed on the printer, turn the printer
off, then turn it back on to make the printer recognizes that the feeder
is installed.
<P>

   TITLE     : LaserWriter Pro Doesn't Recognize Envelope Feeder

</PRE></OL><h3>To Print Envelopes from the Envelope Dialog Box</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Envelopes and Labels. Click the Envelope tab.

<P><LI>Type the Return and Destination Addresses.

<P><LI>Click Options. Click the Printing Options tab.

<P><LI>Click once on the Center Landscape icon (second from the right), make
   sure that the Face Up option is selected and the Clockwise
   Rotation check box is cleared.

<P><LI>Click the Envelope Options tab. Under Envelope Size, select Size 10
   (4 1/8 x 9 1/2 in). If needed, add bar codes and change the Font of
   the return and destination addresses. Click OK.

<P><LI>Click the Print button. The Page Setup dialog box appears.

<P><LI>In the Page Setup dialog box, select Paper "Comm 10 Envelope" and
   Landscape orientation. Click OK. The Print dialog box appears.

<P><LI>Place the envelope in the feeder.
<P>
   NOTE: Place the envelope face up (with the edge against the left side
   of the paper guide) and with the left side of the envelope feeding into
   the printer first. This is different from the preview displayed in the
   Envelope dialog box.
<P>
   For further instructions on setting up the printer for printing
   envelopes, see pages 229-231 of the LaserWriter 16/600 User's Guide.

<P><LI>In the Print dialog box, click Print.
<P>
</OL>The envelope now prints correctly.
<P>
<P><h3>To Print Envelopes Using Mail Merge</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Mail Merge.

<P><LI>In the Mail Merge Helper dialog box, under Step 1: Main Document, click
    Create Envelopes. Select Active Window or New Main Document.

<P><LI>Under Step 2: Data Source, click Create Data Source. If your data
    file has already been created, select Get Data and then select Open
    Data Source from the list that appears. Select your data file in the
    Open dialog box and click Open.
<P>
    NOTE: Skip steps 4, 5 and 10 if you opened an existing data
    file in Step 3.

<P><LI>Choose the desired fields (for example, Title, First Name, Last Name,
    Address, and so forth) and select OK.

<P><LI>Give the data source (data document) a name in the Save Current
    Document As box and save the document.

<P><LI>In the next dialog box, click Set Up Main Document. This opens the 
    Envelope Options dialog box.

<P><LI>Click the Envelope Options tab and select the Envelope Size (Size 10).

<P><LI>Click the Printing Options tab and select the Center Landscape icon
    for the Feed Method (second from the right). Also, make sure that Face
    Up is selected and Clockwise Rotation is not selected. Click OK.

<P><LI>In the Envelope Address dialog box, insert the merge fields for the
    destination address. Click Insert Postal Bar Code if you want to add
    a Postal Bar Code or a FIM-A Courtesy Reply Mail bar code to your 
    envelopes. Click OK. The Page Setup dialog appears.

<P><LI>In the Page Setup dialog, select paper "Comm 10 Envelope" and
    Landscape orientation. Click OK.

<P><LI>In the Mail Merge Helper dialog box, under Step 2: Data Source, click
    Edit Data: &lt;&lt;document name&gt;&gt; and type your data in the data form.
    Click OK.

<P><LI>The Main Document is now set up properly to print envelopes and to
    merge with the data source (data file). Click the Merge to Printer
    button on the Mail Merge toolbar. Or, if you are still in the Mail
    Merge Helper dialog box, click the Merge button under Step 3: Merge the
    Data with the Document, select Merge to Printer and click Merge.
<P>
    NOTE: You can merge to a new document first to check for errors before
    printing, then simply print the resulting envelope document.

<P><LI>Place the envelope in the feeder (the printer will pull the envelope
    appropriately).
<P>
    NOTE: Place the envelope face up (with the edge against the left side
    of the paper guide) and with the left side of the envelope feeding into
    the printer first. This is different from the preview displayed in the
    Envelope dialog box.
<P>
    For further instructions on setting up the printer for printing
    envelopes, see pages 229-231 of the LaserWriter 16/600 User's Guide.

<P><LI>In the Print dialog box, click Print.

<P><LI>Continue feeding envelopes until the Mail Merge is completed.
