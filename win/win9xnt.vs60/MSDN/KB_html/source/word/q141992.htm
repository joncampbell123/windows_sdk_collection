<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to use the mail merge feature in Word to create
labels. A mail merge involves merging a main document with a data source. A
main document contains the text and other items that remain the same in
each label. A data source contains the information that changes in each
label, such as the name and address of each recipient.
<P>
Merge fields, which you insert into the main document, instruct Word where
to print information from the data source. When you perform the mail merge,
Word replaces merge fields in the main document with information from the
data source. Each row (or record) in the data source produces a individual
label.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following procedure demonstrates how to perform a mail merge to create
labels.
<P>
<P><h3>Step One: Main Document</h3>
 
<P>
Start a new document to create a new label, or open an existing document
used previously to merge labels.

<OL><P><LI>Open the document in Word. On the Tools menu, click Mail Merge.
   The "Mail Merge Helper" dialog box appears.

<P><LI>Under "1. Main Document," click Create, and then click Mailing Labels.

<P><LI>Click Active Window.
   The active document becomes the Mail Merge main document.

<P><LI>Word returns to the Mail Merge Helper.
<P>
</OL><h3>Step Two: Data Source</h3>
 
<P>
The data source contains the information that can vary in each label.
You can open an existing data source created in Word, or you can create a
new data source and fill in the addressee information.
<P>
NOTE: The data source can also be created in another program such
as Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Access, or you can use a personal address
book created in Microsoft Exchange or Schedule+, or you can use an ASCII
text file, or another delimited file.

<OL><P><LI>Under "2. Data Source," click Get Data.

<P><LI>The options are to create a new data source, open an existing data
   source, or Header Options. If you are using Word 7.0, Word 97, or

<PRE></PRE>         of field names commonly used in form letters, mailing
         labels, and envelopes. You can rename the fields and
         remove the fields you don't need. To add field names,
         type the name in the Field Name box, and then click
         Add Field Name. Click OK when you're done.

         The set of information in each form makes up one data record.
   
         After entering the information for a record, click Add New to move
         to the next record. After adding all of your data, click OK.
   
      e. Word displays a message box; click Set Up Main Document.
