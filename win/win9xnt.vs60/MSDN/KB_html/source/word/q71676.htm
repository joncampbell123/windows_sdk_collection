The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,
   2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Word for Windows, character and paragraph property indicators on
the ribbon, ruler, and in dialog boxes (such as Format Character) will
not display their states if more than 50 paragraphs are selected, even
if all of the characters or paragraphs have the same properties.
<P>
This is also true if multiple paragraphs in a table are selected.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Because scanning for character, paragraph, or section properties is so
time consuming, if more than 50 paragraphs are selected in a document,
the ribbon, ruler, and dialog boxes will have empty edit controls
(known as a "gray state") and will not activate buttons on the ribbon
or the ruler.
<P>
This behavior duplicates what you would see in the various property
indicators such as Font: and Pts: on the ribbon, if there were
different character properties such as multiple fonts or point sizes
in the selected text. Because more than one property cannot be
displayed in a property indicator at once, the controls must be dimmed
in the presence of a conflict.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Reduce the size of the selection and/or set the property states (such
as a specific font or point size) for the entire document.
