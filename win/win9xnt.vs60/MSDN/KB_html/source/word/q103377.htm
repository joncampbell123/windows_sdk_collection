This article contains the text of "Printing Questions and Answers,"
which is available on the Microsoft FastTips service for Word for
Windows. It answers the most frequently asked questions regarding
printing in Word for Windows.

<PRE>1. Q. How do I change the formatting of envelopes I create using the
      Envelope button on the Word for Windows toolbar?

   A. Word uses two automatic styles, Envelope Return and Envelope
      Address, to format your envelope. You can modify these styles
      to customize the formatting of the return and mailing addresses
      of your envelopes. These styles do not appear in the Style Name
      list on the ribbon or in the Format Style dialog box unless you
      modify them globally or add an envelope to the current Word
      document using the Create Envelope command. If the envelope
      styles do not appear in the Style Name list, you can type the
      appropriate name in the Style Name box to change the default
      settings.

      For example, to change the envelope return address font to
      10-point Helvetica, use the following seven steps:

      1. From the Format menu, choose Style. Choose the Define
         button.

      2. Select or type Envelope Return in the Style Name box.

      3. If you want to change the default format for all envelopes,
         select the Add To Template check box.

      4. Choose the Character button, and select Helvetica in the
         Font box. Select 10 in the Points box.

      5. Choose OK.

      6. Choose the Change button, then choose the Close button.

      7. If you selected the Add To Template check box in step 3
         above, choose Save All from the File menu. Choose the Yes
         button when Word prompts you to save global glossary and
         command changes. When you create a new envelope, Word uses
         the Return Address style and prints the return address in 10-
         point Helvetica.

      For more information, see pages 118 through 119 and 189 through
      218 in the "Microsoft Word for Windows User's Guide."

2. Q. Why doesn't my graphic print in Word 2.0 for Windows?

   A. Graphics may not print for several reasons, and the problem may
      depend on the equipment you are using. Scanned high-resolution
      monochrome graphics may not print because of Windows
      limitations. In such cases, use another file format (such as
      Windows Metafile) or use a lower resolution scan. Files greater
      than 64 kilobytes (K) in size may encounter a Windows converter
      limitation. You may be able to print these images by using the
      following steps:

      1. Select the picture.

      2. From the Edit menu, choose Cut.

      3. From the Edit menu, choose Paste Special.

      4. Under Data Type, select Bitmap, then choose the OK button.

      Images scaled in Word for Windows may not print on some
      printers. Scale the image with the originating application or
      choose Picture from the Format menu in Word for Windows, scale
      the image to 100 percent, and try printing again. Ensure that you
      have the latest available printer driver. To determine the printer
      driver version, use the following steps:

      1. From the File menu, choose Printer Setup.

      2. Select your printer and choose the Setup button.

      3. Make sure that Draft mode is not selected.

      4. Choose the About button. (A version number should be
         displayed.)

      5. If there is no About button, look for a "V number" near the
         OK button.

      Some representative driver versions include the following:
      Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet Series II, version 3.4 or later;
      HP LaserJet Series III, version 3.0.3.85 or later; HP PaintJet
      500 version 2.0; and IBM Personal Pageprinter version 3.4.

3. Q. Why can't I print the equations I made in Microsoft Equation
      Editor?

   A. If you are using an HP DeskJet series printer or a dot-matrix
      printer, equations do not print because these printers do not
      support the symbol fonts used by Equation Editor. You may be
      able to get some of the Equation Editor characters to print by
      changing the settings for the Uppercase Greek, Lowercase Greek,
      and Symbol styles in the Define Style command.

      If you have Microsoft Windows version 3.1 or a third-party font
      manager that recognizes PostScript Type 1 fonts, you can print
      equations using the TrueType or PostScript versions of the
      Equation Editor fonts. Use the following instructions to
      install the Equation Editor TrueType or PostScript fonts:

      Windows Version 3.1 TrueType Fonts
      ----------------------------------

      If you installed Windows version 3.1 after you installed Word
      version 2.0, you need to reinstall Equation Editor using the
      Word Setup program. Setup detects Windows version 3.1 and
      installs the TrueType version of the Equation Editor fonts.
      Your equations should now print correctly on DeskJet or dot-
      matrix printers.

      Third-Party Font Manager
      ------------------------

      Note: Use this option if you have a version of Windows earlier
      than version 3.1. If you have Windows version 3.1, use the
      instructions in the previous section instead.

      If you have a third-party font manager that supports PostScript
      Type 1 fonts (such as Adobe Type Manager or SuperPrint), use it
      to install the Equation Editor PostScript fonts. The following
      instructions describe how to use one specific font manager,
      Adobe Type Manager (ATM), to install Equation Editor fonts:

      1. Install a Windows PostScript printer driver through the
         Windows Control Panel and make that printer the default
         printer.

      2. Exit Word for Windows and Equation Editor.

      3. Activate the ATM Control Panel. Note: The ATM icon usually
         displays as a lowercase cursive "a."

      4. In ATM, choose the Add button.

      5. Specify the entire path to the fonts that you added when
         setting up the Equation Editor. The following is a typical
         path:

            C:\WINDOWS\MSAPPS\EQUATION

      6. The Fences, MT Symbol, MT Extra, and MT Symbol Italic fonts
         appear in the Available Fonts box.

      7. Choose the fonts to be installed, and choose the Add button.

      8. You must exit and restart Microsoft Windows for the ATM
         changes to take effect.

4. Q. How can I increase the printing speed of Word for Windows?

   A. Here are four things you can do to increase printing speed in
      Word:

      1. Use a printer font instead of a downloadable font.

      2. Make sure there is a SET TEMP statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
         file and that it points to a valid directory with at least 2
         megabytes free disk space.

      3. In Windows Print Manager, choose the High Priority setting
         to allocate more computer processor time to Print Manager.
         Your documents print faster, but you must wait longer for
         the hourglass to disappear in Word when you print.

      4. Free up conventional memory using the following steps:

         a. Remove unnecessary device drivers and memory-resident
            software from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files,
            such as screen savers and virus detection software.

         b. In Word, choose Draft from the View menu.

         c. Maximize both the Word application and document windows.

5. Q. I am using an HP LaserJet IIP with Word for Windows and my
      envelope does not print or it prints incorrectly. What can I
      do?

   A. If you are running with Windows version 3.1, do the following:

      1. Make sure the printer selected in the Print Setup dialog box
         is the IIP, and not the II. If the II is selected, the
         envelope address prints in the wrong position.

      2. In the Tools Options Print dialog box, make sure neither of
         the following options is selected:

          - Reverse Print Order

          - Printer's Envelope Feeder has been Installed

      If you are running with Windows version 3.0, you need version
      3.4 or later of the HP LaserJet Series IIP printer driver. If
      you have an earlier version of the printer driver, you should
      contact Microsoft Sales Information Center at (800) 426-9400 and
      request the Supplemental Driver Library for Windows version 3.0. If
      you call from outside the United States, contact Microsoft
      International Customer Service at (425) 936-8661.

6. Q. Why does Word print a blank envelope on my HP LaserJet Plus
      printer?

   A. If you are running with Windows version 3.1, you must set a
      printer heuristic to print envelopes correctly on the HP
      LaserJet Plus. To do this, add the following line to the
      [Microsoft Word 2.0] section of your WIN.INI file:

         HPPCL=+4

      With this heuristic, envelopes print correctly when you feed
      them on the right side of the paper tray.

      For information on editing the WIN.INI file, see page 810 in
      the "Microsoft Word for Windows User's Guide."

      If you are running with Windows version 3.0, you do not need to
      set a printer heuristic. To print envelopes on the HP LaserJet
      Plus, you must use version 3.4 or later of the Windows LaserJet
      printer driver. To obtain this driver, contact Microsoft
      Sales Information Center at (800) 426-9400 and request the
      Supplemental Driver Library for Windows version 3.0.

7. Q. I want to use the envelope tray with my HP LaserJet II printer.
      In the File Print Setup dialog box, the envelope tray does not
      appear as a Paper Source setting. What can I do?

   A. To use the envelope tray with your HP LaserJet Series II
      printer, select the HP LaserJet Series IID as your active
      printer in the File Print Setup dialog box in Word.

8. Q. I get the error message "Cannot print" when I try to print from
      Word for Windows. How can I get Word to print?

   A. The "Cannot print" error message may occur if you do not have
      enough free disk space for Word to create temporary print
      spooling files. Make sure there is a SET TEMP statement in your
      AUTOEXEC.BAT file and that it points to a valid directory with
      at least 2 megabytes (MB) free disk space (3 MB or more is
      recommended). By default, Windows uses C:\WINDOWS\TEMP as the
      TEMP directory.

      You should not use the root directory on your hard disk as the
      TEMP directory. If Print Manager exceeds the capacity of your
      root directory when it swaps temporary files to disk while
      printing, the print job fails and the "Cannot print" error
      message occurs. As a result, you should use a location other
      than your root directory for your TEMP variable.
