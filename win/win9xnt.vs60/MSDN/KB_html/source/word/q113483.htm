6.00 6.00a
WINDOWS
<P>
<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a
<LI>Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Word 6.0a Patch setup program, you may receive the
following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to find the .STF file in the WIN.INI.

</PRE>if you have Microsoft Office version 4.2 for Windows on your computer and
if you installed it in the following specific sequence:

<OL><P><LI>You installed the full retail Office 4.0 package--not the Office 4.0
   upgrade package.

<P><LI>You installed the Office 4.2 upgrade--not the full retail Office 4.2
   package.

<P><LI>You tried to upgrade to Word 6.0a for Windows using the Word 6.0a
   patch.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: This problem does not occur if you installed Office 4.0 using the
upgrade package or if you installed Word 6.0 before you installed Office
4.0. Similarly, it does not occur if you installed Office 4.2 using the
full retail package.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you upgrade to Office 4.2, Setup replaces your old SETUP.STF file with
a new SETUP.STF file; the new .STF file does not contain the Word 6.0
information the Word 6.0a Patch needs to upgrade your Word for Windows
program. The Word 6.0a Patch searches in the [MS Setup (ACME) Table Files]
section of your WIN.INI file for either of the following two entries:
<P>
<PRE>   WINWORD.EXE@v6.0.0.2226(1033)=C:\WINWORD\SETUP\SETUP.STF

   MSOFFICE.EXE@v1.0.0.0000(1033)=C:\MSOFFICE\SETUP\SETUP.STF

</PRE></OL>In the installation sequence described above, there is no WINWORD.EXE line
in the [MS Setup (ACME) Table Files] section of your WIN.INI file (only
Word 6.0 Setup, not Office Setup, writes the WINWORD.EXE line to your
WIN.INI). As a result, the Word 6.0a Patch only looks at the SETUP.STF file
specified by the MSOFFICE.EXE line, which is the .STF file installed by
Office 4.2 that does not contain any Word 6.0 information.
<P>
In other words, this problem occurs when:

<OL><P><LI>There is no WINWORD.EXE line in the [MS Setup (ACME) Table Files]
   section of your WIN.INI file.
<P>
   -and-

<P><LI>The Word 6.0a Patch looks at the SETUP.STF file installed by the
   Office 4.2 upgrade, which does not contain any Word 6.0 information.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Rename the SETUP.STF file installed by the Office 4.2 upgrade (for
   example, rename the file to SETUP.OLD).

<P><LI>Reinstall Office 4.0, but choose to only install Word 6.0. You do not
   need to reinstall Microsoft Excel or PowerPoint if you have already
   upgraded to Microsoft Excel 5.0 and PowerPoint 4.0. This restores the
   SETUP.STF file that contains Word 6.0 information.

<P><LI>Run the Word 6.0a Patch again.

<P><LI>Upgrade to Office 4.2.
