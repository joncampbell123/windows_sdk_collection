<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Script Wizard, an add-in for Microsoft Word, has been created by Stefani
Warren &amp; Associates to include scene numbers for screenplays and video,
automated act and scene numbering, and page header notations for television
and stage scripts.
<P>
This program is particularly useful for screenplay writing.
<P>
<P><h3>Features of Script Wizard</h3>
 

<UL><LI>All script forms and styles are supported.

<LI>Script Wizard includes templates for 12 professional script formats,
   including screenplays, sitcoms, soap operas, radio-style scripts, stage
   plays, 2-column A/V, and story board formats.

<LI>Scripts are faxable.

<LI>You can use WinFAX with Script Wizard files by clicking a button. And,
   you can send and receive files via modem for direct editing.

<LI>Scripts can be imported and exported.

<LI>Script Wizard can import script files written in Movie Master,
   Scriptware, DOS Word/WSA, TWCS, Word Perfect, Script Perfection, Super
   Script, Final Draft, Word for Macintosh, and Scriptor OUT files. It can
   export files back to those same programs.

<LI>Script Wizard is seamlessly integrated.

<LI>Scriptwriting toolbars and menus appear when Script Wizard files are
   opened, and disappear again when they are closed. Display options are
   maintained separately from those which the user sets for work in basic
   Word For Windows. And, you can run as many other add-ons and add-ins as
   your computer's working memory will allow. Shortcut keys and toolbars
   make writing and formatting scripts quick and easy. Detailed dialog
   boxes and online help guide you through every step of every script
   writing task.
