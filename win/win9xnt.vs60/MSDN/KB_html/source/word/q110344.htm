The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 5.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You can add commonly used addresses to the Create Envelope feature in Word
5.1 for the Macintosh, including a Default Return Address. However, if you
create a Default Return Address, you cannot delete it using the Delete
button in the Addresses dialog box.
<P>
If you highlight the default return address in the lower address box and
press the DELETE key, the address is cleared, but the Define button is
unavailable unless text is present in the lower box.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Delete button allows you to delete previously created addresses by
selecting the address name and then choosing Delete. However, since the
Default Return Address feature cannot be deleted, the Delete button is
unavailable (dimmed) when you select Default Return Address in the address
name list box.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
Method 1: To delete the previously defined default return address:
<P>
<PRE>          a. From the Tools menu, choose Create Envelope.

          b. Click the Addresses button.

          c. Under the New Address, select Default Return Address.

          d. In the box at the bottom, select the address shown.
             Delete it by pressing the DELETE key.

          e. Double-click Default Return Address under the New Address
             heading in the top box.

</PRE>Method 2: CAUTION: This method will delete the default return address as
<PRE>          well as ALL other addresses stored in Word's Create Envelope
          feature:

          a. Quit Microsoft Word.

          b. Locate and discard the Word Toolbar Prefs file, located in the
             Preferences folder within the System Folder (under System
             7.x).

          c. Restart Microsoft Word.
