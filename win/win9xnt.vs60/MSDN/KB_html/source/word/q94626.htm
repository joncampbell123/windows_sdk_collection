<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Word for Windows, when you add a term that is preceded by a period (such
as ".Dot") to an index, the term may not appear in the alphabetical order
you expect. This is due to the method Word uses to order indexes and is by
design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Word uses a standard alphanumeric sort order for indexing. Entries that do
not begin with an alpha or numeric character are sorted first. Entries that
begin with non-alphanumeric characters (such as periods) are first ordered
numerically by the ANSI numeric code that corresponds to the (non-
alphanumeric) character. If the index contains more than one such entry and
the entries contain alpha characters, they are ordered alphabetically as
you would expect -- except that they will still precede all entries that
begin with numbers or letters.
<P>
Entries beginning with numbers are sorted after those beginning with
special characters. Entries beginning with alpha characters are sorted
last. The following list shows a sample index sorted according to these
rules:
<P>
<PRE>   .bak
   .doc
   .dot
   1 Microsoft Way
   2 too many
   Apple
   Banana

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you want INDEX (XE) entries beginning with special characters to be
sorted within the entire index, instead of appearing first, leave off the
special character when you add the entry to the index, generate the index,
and then manually add the special character. Every time you regenerate the
index, you'll need to manually add the special characters.
