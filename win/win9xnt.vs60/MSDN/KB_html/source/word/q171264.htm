The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
   on the following platform: Windows NT
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
   on the following platform: Windows NT
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you create an equation field, the top part of the field result may be
cut off when viewing the equation on the screen or when printing it.
<P>
For example, when you type in the following equation field
<P>
<PRE>   {EQ \i \in \su(1,5,x)}

</PRE>and then turn the field codes off to display the field result, the top of
the summation character may be cut off.
<P>
NOTE: This problem does not occur when running Word 7.0 or 97 under Windows
95.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you use Microsoft Word 7.0 or 97 and print using
the Hewlett Packard LaserJet 4 printer driver version 3.37 for Windows NT
4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use any of the following workarounds.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Change the Line Spacing</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Select the paragraph containing the equation field that is cut off.

<P><LI>On the Format menu, click Paragraph.

<P><LI>On the Indents and Spacing tab, change Line spacing to Exactly, and then
   change the At box to a height that will allow the top of the equation to
   be displayed fully.
<P>
   NOTE: The greater the At spacing, the farther the equation will be
   moved down. This effect may cause more white space between the equation
   and the preceding line of text. If you have any additional text on the
   same line as the equation, the text will also be moved down.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Use Equation Editor</h3>
 
<P>
Instead of using the equation field to create the equation, use the
Equation Editor.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
