The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0, 6.0a
<LI>Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Word 6.x, when you run a macro that you created in Word 2.x, errors may 
occur or Call statements may run a same-name macro from the wrong template.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Word 6.x follows a different set of rules than Word 2.x does to determine 
which template macro to run when two macros have the same name: Word 2.x 
runs the macro from the template attached to the document where the 
insertion point is currently located, and Word 6.x runs the macro from the 
template from which you launched the macro. This difference in resolving 
macro naming conflicts may cause errors when you run Word 2.x macros in 
Word 6.x.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the versions of Microsoft 
Word listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in 
later versions of Microsoft Word with the addition of a new WordBasic 
command, WW2CallingConvention(). In Word 6.0a and later, you can use 
WW2CallingConvention() to toggle between the Word 2.x and Word 6.x methods 
for resolving macro name conflicts. Refer to the "More Information" section 
below for details about WW2CallingConvention().

<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/">http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/refguide/</A></B> 

</PRE>In both Word versions 2.x and 6.x, you can call one macro from another
using the ToolsMacro statement or the following Call syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   [Call] MacroName[.SubName] [ArgumentList]

</PRE>In Word 2.x, if there are two macros with the same name, Word runs the
macro from the active template (that is, the template where the insertion
point is located), whereas Word 6.x runs the macro from the template where
the calling macro resides.
<P>
<P><h3>WW2CallingConvention Statement Syntax</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   WW2CallingConvention [0, 1]

</PRE>The WW2CallingConvention statement toggles between the Word 6.x and Word
2.x naming-conflict resolution method.
<P>
<PRE>   Value     Explanation
   -----     -----------

     0       Word 6.x behavior (in favor of the calling template)

     1       Word 2.x behavior (in favor of the active template)

   NOTE: The default argument is 1. In other words, if you do not include
   an argument, WW2CallingConvention switches to Word 2.x behavior.

</PRE><h3>WW2CallingConvention() Function Syntax</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   WW2CallingConvention()

   Value     Explanation
   -----     -----------

     0       Word 6.x Mode (Word 6.x calling convention is currently
             in effect)

    -1       Word 2.x Mode (Word 2.x calling convention is currently
             in effect)

</PRE><h3>Demonstration: Difference Between Word 2.x and Word 6.x Conventions</h3>
 
<P>
Use the following procedure to demonstrate the difference between the two
WW2CallingConvention settings:

<OL><P><LI>Create the following macro in Normal.dot named "Test1":
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Main
         MsgBox "This is from Normal.dot"
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Create the following macro in Template.dot named "Test1":
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Main
         MsgBox "This is from Template.dot"
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Create the following macro in Normal.dot named "LikeWord2":
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Main
         WW2CallingConvention 1
         FileNew .Template = "Template.dot"
         Call Test1
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Create the following macro in Normal.dot named "LikeWord6":
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Main
         WW2CallingConvention 0
         FileNew .Template = "Template.dot"
         Call Test1
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Run the "LikeWord2" macro.

<P><LI>Run the "LikeWord6" macro.
<P>
</OL>To obtain Word 6.0c, call the Microsoft Order Desk at (800) 360-7561 and
request the Word 6.0c update. If you are outside the United States, contact
the Microsoft subsidiary for your area. If you are outside the United
States, contact your local subsidiary. To locate your subsidiary, see the
