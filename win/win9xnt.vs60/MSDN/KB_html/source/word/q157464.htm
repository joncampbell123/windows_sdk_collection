The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden system files in
the Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Word 97 stores all of its settings in the Windows registry; Word 97 no
longer stores information in a *.ini file or in the Winword.opt file like
Word 6.x does.
<P>
This article lists which settings in the registry pertain to Word 97.
The article is divided into the following sections:

<UL><LI>Main locations of Word settings
<LI>Settings in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word
<LI>Settings in HKEY\CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Common
<LI>Settings in HKEY\CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\MS Setup (ACME)
<LI>Settings in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools
<LI>Miscellaneous settings
<LI>Using the RegOptions macro
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
before you edit the registry.
<P>
<P><h2>Main Locations of Word Settings</h2>
 
<P>
Most settings in Word are stored in:
<P>
<PRE>   \\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word

</PRE>Changes made to the \\HKEY_CURRENT_USER key are mirrored in:
<P>
<PRE>   \\HKEY_USERS\Default\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word

</PRE>The difference between the two locations is that first one applies only to
the current user of the system, and the other is the default for all users.
However, Word entries are the same for both so any change made to one is
automatically reflected in the other.
<P>
For the remainder of this article, all references to the
\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER key apply also to the \\HKEY_USERS key, except where
noted.
<P>
<P><h2>Settings in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word</h2>
 
<P>
The settings that you may need to examine during troubleshooting are
located in this key. The Data key and the Options key are the most
frequently changed areas.
<P>
<P><h3>Data Key</h3>
 
<P>
Path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word\Data
<P>
<PRE>      The Word 97 for Windows equivalent to the Word 6.x Winword.opt
      file is the Data key. This key contains binary information for MRU
      lists, including the MRU file list and the MRU address book list. It
      also contains the same information as was stored in the Winword.opt
      file in Word for Windows 6.x, such as Track Changes settings
      (Revision settings in Word 6.x) and Edit settings.

</PRE><h3>Default Save Key</h3>
 
<P>
Path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word\Default Save
<P>
<PRE>      This key sets the default format for saving documents. You can change
      the default format Word 97 uses by changing the Save Word Files As
      setting in Word. To locate this option in Word, click Options on the
      Tools menu, and then click the Save tab.

      by changing menu options or by running the RegOptions macro.

      optional settings. Default settings are established during Setup

         Tools-Path             Sets alternative locations for proofing
                                tools.
