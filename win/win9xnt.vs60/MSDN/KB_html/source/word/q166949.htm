</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you have Outlook 97 and Word 97 installed on your computer and you try
to fax to an Outlook Contact without starting Word 97 at least once, Word
will appear to hang during the faxing process.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The first time you start Word (or any Office 97 program), you will be
prompted for the user name and initials. If Word is started for the first
time from a fax request, the dialog box requesting user information will
appear. However, Word will not have the focus, so Word will appear to hang
(in actuality, Word is waiting for the user information).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, switch to Word 97, type the user information and
click OK in the dialog box. The fax will continue to be sent.
<P>
Future faxing will not have this problem because Word only needs the user
information to be entered the first time it is started.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
