<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Word 5.0 and 5.1 and PowerPoint 3.0 all contain certain files that
have the same names and functions (such as the Equation Editor). This
article explains how to share various files between Word and
PowerPoint and avoid unnecessary duplication.
<P>
The following underlined headings describe the specific environments
in which certain files can be shared.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 5.1, PowerPoint 3.0, and System 7.x</h3>
 
<P>
Shareable Files: Microsoft Graph and Microsoft Graph Help
<P>
To share these files, place Microsoft Graph and Microsoft Graph Help
in a folder titled Microsoft Graph located in the Word Commands
folder. Make an alias for the Microsoft Graph folder and place the
alias in the Microsoft Folder located in System Folder:Extensions.
<P>
Note that System 6 users cannot use Graph because Graph takes
advantage of the System 7 object linking and embedding (OLE)
capability. Microsoft Graph did not ship with Word 5.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 5.0 and 5.1, PowerPoint 3.0, and Any System Version</h3>
 
<P>
Shareable Files: Equation Editor and Equation Editor Help
<P>
To share these files, simply keep them together in any location. Word
and PowerPoint will use them as long both files are in the same folder
or directory level.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Files That Cannot Be Shared</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>Word for Windows 1             (Word and PowerPoint converter file)
Word for Windows 2             (Word and PowerPoint converter file)
EPS-TIFF-PICT                  (Word and PowerPoint converter file)
U.S. English Dictionary        (Word spelling file)

</PRE>The converters have been tested only with the products they ship with.
Although any one converter may work with both programs under some
situations, Microsoft recommends that for best results, both copies of
the converters should be retained. To save disk space, you should
remove converters that you will not use.
<P>
Word 5.0 and 5.1 use the dictionary called U.S. English Dictionary.
This dictionary cannot be shared with other Microsoft applications.
<P>
An alias file is a System-7-specific feature. To make an alias, select
the item from which you want to make an alias. From the File menu,
choose Make Alias. The alias will appear next to the original item.
<P>
