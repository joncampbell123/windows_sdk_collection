</PRE><h2>Additional Fixes</h2>
 
<P>
The following fixed bugs are documented only in this article.
<P>
<P><h3>Updated Wdreadme.txt</h3>
 
<P>
The Wdreadme.txt has been updated to provide new or more complete
information about the following topics:

<UL><LI>Changes in the typical Setup components
<LI>WordBasic Error 582
<LI>The new macro virus alert feature
<P>
</UL><h3>Deleting an Object from a Template Containing a Field May Hang Word</h3>
 
<P>
When you open a new document based on a Normal template that contains a
field, if you insert an object such as a Word document, and then delete the
object, Word may hang (stop responding).
<P>
<P><h3>Incorrect Mapping of Some Characters When File Saved in Text-Only Format</h3>
 
<P>
When you save a document as text only, some of the extended characters are
mapped incorrectly. For example, some Greek characters may be changed to
1/2 or 1/4.
<P>
<P><h3>Dialog Update Causes Incorrect Conversion in Insert Picture Dialog Box</h3>
 
<P>
If you click Picture on the Insert menu and select a picture that has
extended characters in its name, the picture may not be displayed.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 6.0-7.0 Converter Updated Because of Far East Version Number Change</h3>
 
<P>
A new Word 6.0-7.0 converter for Asian Word was shipped because of a
version change in Korean and Simplified Chinese Word.
<P><h3>Imager dll updated to work with new HP scanning software</h3>
 
<P>
An updated Imager Dynamic Link Library (DLL) file to work with new
Hewlett-Packard scanning software will ship with Office Pro 95a.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Word .doc Files Are Registered as Safe File Types for Internet Explorer</h3>
 
<P>
Before this release, you received the following warning from Internet
Explorer:
<P>
<PRE>   the document may contain a virus...do you want to continue?

</PRE>Now, Word .doc files are registered as "safe" for Internet Explorer, and
Internet Explorer does not flash the warning message.
<P>
<P><h3>Updated Pict Filter</h3>
 
<P>
In Word for Windows 95, version 7.0, a supporting file called Msvcr20.dll
was not installed properly. In version 7.0a, the dependency on this file is
removed.
<P>
<P><h3>Word Now Integrates with Netscape</h3>
 
<P>
If you have Netscape installed, Word updates the registry entries so that
Word is the program that is used with .doc, .dot, and .rtf files from
Netscape. Before the release of 7.0a, Word was not used.
<P>
<P><h3>Pasting Information from a Closed WordMail Note May Cause a GP Fault</h3>
 
<P>
When you open a WordMail note, copy the note, close the note, compose a new
note, paste the information, and then start typing, these actions may
result in a general protection (GP) fault.
<P>
<P><h3>Word Doesn't Create "My Documents" Folder When Installed on Windows NT</h3>
 
<P>
After you install Office 95 on a computer running Windows NT 3.51, the "My
Documents" folder is not created, and the Open dialog box (on the File
menu, click Open) defaults to the Winword folder.
<P>
<P><h3>Pressing ESC to Exit In-place Editing Causes GP Fault</h3>
 
<P>
If you click Object on the Insert menu in a Word document in some container
programs, you may receive a GP fault.
<P>
<P><h3>Always Prompted to Save Changes When Closing Text File After Save</h3>
 
<P>
In Word 7.0, if you save a file as Text and then close it, you receive
another message asking you if you want to save formatting. In Word 7.0a,
you do not get the second message prompting you to save formatting.
<P>
Character Style with Hidden Text in Template Loses
<P><h3>Hidden Attribute When Saved with Rich Text Formatting (RTF)</h3>
 
<P>
If you have one character style based on another character style that is
formatted as hidden, the "hidden" formatting attributes are lost when you
save the document as RTF and reopen it.
<P>
Odd Behavior Opening Many WordMail Messages
and Clicking Send on the File Menu in Word
 
<P>
Opening approximately 20 e-mail messages using WordMail can produce
unexpected results such as MAPI errors, hangs, random text placement, and
screen redraw problems.
