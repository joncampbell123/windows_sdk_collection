The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Sometimes a document that you add to a menu does not open when you choose
it from the menu. Instead, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Word cannot open the document. (&lt;current directory&gt;\&lt;filename&gt;)

</PRE>Note: To add a document to a menu so you can open that document by choosing
it from the menu, use the Customize command on the Tools menu or press
CTRL+ALT+= and then select the document in the File Open dialog box. For a
specific description of both procedures, see the "Workaround" section
below.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you add a document to a menu using the CTRL+ALT+= method (described in
the "Procedure 1: CTRL+ALT+= Method" section below), if you do not include
the entire path to the document in the File Name box, Word cannot find the
document when you choose it unless the file is located in the current
directory. For example, if you choose MY_FILE.DOC from the File menu, Word
cannot find MY_FILE.DOC if it is located in a directory other than the
current directory.
<P>
Note: The current directory is the one that appears above the Directories
list in the File Save As or File Open dialog box.
<P>
By contrast, this does not happen if you add the document to a menu using
the Customize command on the Tools menu (this procedure is described in the
"Procedure 2: Using the Customize Command" section below).
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Word for Windows versions
6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0c. This problem was corrected in Word version 7.0 for
Windows 95. This problem was also corrected in Word version 6.0 for Windows
NT.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To add a document to a menu so you can open that document by choosing it
from the menu regardless of the current directory, use either of the
following two procedures:
<P>
<P><h3>Procedure 1: CTRL+ALT+= Method</h3>
 
<P>
Note: This method adds the document only to the File menu. If you want to
add the document to a different menu, use Procedure 2.

<OL><P><LI>Press CTRL+ALT+=. Notice that the mouse pointer changes to a plus sign
   (+).

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open.

<P><LI>In the File Name box, type the entire path (including the drive) to the
   document you want to add to the File menu.
<P>
   Important: It doesn't matter whether you select the location from the
   Drives and Directories lists. The critical factor is that the full path
   and document name appear in the File Name box.

<P><LI>Choose OK. Next time you open the File menu, the document name appears
   at the bottom of the menu, below the Recently Used File (MRU) list.
<P>
</OL><h3>Procedure 2: Using the Customize Command</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the document you want to add to a menu.

<P><LI>From the Tools menu, choose Customize.

<P><LI>Select the Menus tab.

<P><LI>From the Categories list, select File. From the Commands list, select
   "FileOpenFile:".

<P><LI>From the Change What Menu list, select the menu you want to add the
   document to. Change the Position On Menu, Name On Menu, and Save Changes
   In settings as necessary.

<P><LI>From the FileOpenFile list, select the name of the document you want to
   add to a menu (the FileOpenFile list contains the names of all the
   documents currently open in Word).

<P><LI>Choose the Add button, then choose the Close button.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Neither of the above methods appears in the printed or online
documentation for Word 6.0.
