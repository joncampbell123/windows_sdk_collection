The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Microsoft Word for the Macintosh Setup, you may experience
either of the following problems:

<UL><LI>Word selects an incorrect destination folder during Setup.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>After you select a destination folder, you receive the following error
   message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Word 6.0 Setup was not completed successfully.
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems occur when you have either of the following third-party
programs installed on your comptuer:

<UL><LI>Super Boomerang (a utility that ships with Now Utilities)

<LI>Norton's Directory Assistance II
<P>
</UL>Both of these programs modify how applications select folders. For example,
your applications suggest the most recent, previous folder in the Open
dialog box and Save dialog boxes when either of these products are
installed. This same behavior occurs when you run Word Setup.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use one of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: If You Have Not Yet Installed Word</h3>
 
<P>
Before running Microsoft Word Setup, start your system with the extensions
off. To do this, press and hold the SHIFT key as you restart your computer.
Continue to hold down the SHIFT key until you receive the message
"Extensions are off." At this point, you can start the Word Setup program.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: If You Have Already Installed Word</h3>
 
<P>
If you have already installed Word, use the following steps to locate the
application program icon:

<OL><P><LI>From the Finder, click Find on the File menu.

<P><LI>In the Find dialog box, type "Microsoft Word" (without the quotation
   marks).

<P><LI>Click the Find button.

<P><LI>The Find utility displays the first file with Microsoft Word in the file
   name. If this is not the Word application, click Find Again on the
   File menu.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a compatibility problem between
Microsoft Word version 6.0 for the Macintosh and Norton Directory
Assistance II and between Word and Super Boomerang 4.0. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
