<P>
Sometimes the Workstation Installation option does not appear when you
run the Word for Windows Setup program after you ran a successful
Server Installation. This usually happens for one of the following two
reasons:

<OL><P><LI>You did not choose the Server Installation option the first time you ran
   Setup.
<P>
   After a successful server installation, the Word for Windows program
   directory should contain 76 files and 10 subdirectories. If the
   directory contains a different number of files and subdirectories, you
   may have problems when you run the Setup program again. If your Word for
   Windows directory does not contain the correct number of files and
   directories, run another server installation, then run a workstation
   installation.

<P><LI>Setup did not correctly update the WWORD20.INF file.
<P>
   During the server installation, Setup should have added three items to
   the WWORD20.INF file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [Workstation] section
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      User name
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Company name
</PRE><P>
   If Setup did not add the [Workstation] section, you can add it to the
   end of WWORD20.INF using any text editor. The entry should read as
   follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [Workstation]
      Yes
</PRE><P>
   This setting causes Setup to offer the Workstation Installation option
   even if you did not previously run a server installation. Be sure to run
   a server installation before running a workstation installation.
