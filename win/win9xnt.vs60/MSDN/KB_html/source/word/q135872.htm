The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<PRE>                                  SUMMARY
                                  =======

</PRE>Word 6.0 stores all settings in the Winword6.ini and Winword.opt files.
Word 7.0 does not use equivalent files to store these settings. Word 7.0
stores these settings in the Windows registry.
<P>
This article lists which settings in the registry pertain to Word 7.0
settings. The article is divided into the following sections:

<UL><LI>Main locations of Word settings
<LI>Settings in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Word\7.0
<LI>Settings in HKEY\CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Microsoft Office\95
<LI>Settings in HKEY\CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\MS Setup (ACME)
<LI>Settings in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools
<LI>Miscellaneous settings
<LI>Using the RegOptions macro
<P>
<PRE>                             MORE INFORMATION
                             ================

</PRE></UL>WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
before you edit the registry.
<P>
<P><h2>MAIN LOCATIONS OF WORD SETTINGS</h2>
 
<P>
Most settings in Word are stored in:
<P>
<PRE>   \\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Word\7.0

</PRE>Changes made to the above key are mirrored in:
<P>
<PRE>   \\HKEY_USERS\Default\Software\Microsoft\Word\7.0

</PRE>The difference between the two locations is that first one applies only to
the current user of the system, and the other is the default for all users.
However, Word entries are the same for both so any change made to one is
automatically reflected in the other.
<P>
For the remainder of this article, all references to the
\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER key apply also to the \\HKEY_USERS key, except where
noted.
<P>
<P><h2>SETTINGS IN HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\WORD\7.0</h2>
 
<P>
The settings that you may need to examine during troubleshooting are
located in this key. The Data key and the Options key are the most
frequently changed areas.
<P>
<P><h3>Data Key</h3>
 
<P>
Path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Word\7.0\Data
<P>
<PRE>      The Word for Windows 95 equivalent to the Word 6.0 Winword.opt file
      is the Data key. This key contains binary information for MRU lists,
      including the MRU file list and the MRU address book list. The Data
      key also contains the same information as that which was stored in
      the Winword.opt file in Word for Windows 6.0x, such as Revision
      settings and Edit settings.

</PRE><h3>Options Key</h3>
 
<P>
Path: \\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Word\7.0\Options
<P>
<PRE>      This key stores those options that the user can set from Word,
      either by changing menu options or by running the RegOptions macro.
      These are the "editable" options.

      The settings here fall into two groups: default settings and
      optional settings. Default settings are established during Setup and
      the user can change them by modifying options in Word. Optional
      settings are not created during Setup; to add them you must run the
      RegOptions macro.

      The default settings located here are:

         AutoSpell      Turns Automatic Spell on or off

         DOC-PATH       Sets the default folder for Word documents

         NoEditTime     Turns on and off recording of edit time in
                        statistics

         PICTURE-PATH   Sets the path for clip art

         PROGRAMDIR     Sets the program folder

         STARTUP-PATH   Sets the path for startup folder

         StartWhatIsNew Turns "What is New" screen on and off at startup

         TOOLS-PATH     Sets alternative locations for proofing tools

         WORDMAIL-PATH  Sets WordMail directory path

         WPHelp         Turns WordPerfect Help on or off

      The optional settings located here are:

         AUTOSAVE-PATH  Sets default folder for AutoSave documents

         Bak-Extension  Sets default extension for backup files

         BitMapMemory   Sets memory for internal graphics cache

         CacheSize      Sets internal document text cache for Word

         DDETimeout     Allows you to set the time in seconds Word waits
                        for a DDE message from another DDE application.
                        For example, DDETimeout=60

      NOTE: There are two settings that Word and Office share. These
      settings are not stored in this key, but are stored as follows:

      USER-DOT-PATH         HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\
                            Microsoft Office\95\FileNew\LocalTemplates

      WORKGROUP-DOT-PATH    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\
                            Microsoft Office\95\FileNew\SharedTemplates

</PRE><h3>Help Key</h3>
 
<P>
Path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Word\7.0\Help\Files
<P>
<PRE>      This key contains the paths for Word's Help files. Word Help,
      WordPerfect Help, and WordBasic Help paths are found here.

</PRE><h3>More Info Key</h3>
 
<P>
Path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Word\7.0\More Info
<P>
<PRE>      The purpose of this key is unknown.

</PRE><h3>Proofing Tools Key</h3>
 
<P>
Path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Word\7.0\Proofing Tools
<P>
<PRE>      This key contains information for Words proofing tools. Hyphenation,
      Grammar, Thesaurus, and Spelling are located under this key. Each
      tool registers languages here and the paths for its engine and the
      dictionary for each language. For example, the following setting
      points to the path for the English (1033) dictionary for Word.

          HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Word\7.0\Proofing
          Tools\Spelling\1033\Normal\Dictionary

</PRE><h3>Stationery Key</h3>
 
<P>
Path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Word\7.0\Stationery
<P>
<PRE>      This key contains the default location for the template for WordMail
      and the links to find the template.

      The four settings here are:

      Cfg File Location   Sets the path to the WordMail folder

      Default Template    Sets the path to the template (by default,
                          Email.dot)

      DlgDefTpl           Shows a link to the default template

      Option              Shows a link to the default template

</PRE><h3>Text Converters Key</h3>
 
<P>
Path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Word\7.0\Text Converters
<P>
<PRE>      This key contains registration information for Word's text
      converters. It includes keys for import and export converters. Each
      converter registers its extension, name, and path here.

      NOTE: One uncommon converter registered here is the Schedule Plus
      converter that allows import of contact lists through address book.
      The path is

          HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Word\7.0\Text
          Converters\Import\Splus

</PRE><h3>WordMail Key</h3>

<P>
<P><h2>USING THE REGOPTIONS MACRO</h2>
 
<P>
The RegOptions macro can be used to examine the Windows registry or to make
changes to Word settings stored there. To run the macro:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Templates.

<P><LI>Click the Add button.

<P><LI>Change the directory to the Macros subdirectory under Winword (for
   example, C:\MSOffice\Winword\Macro).

<P><LI>Select the Macros7.Dot file and click OK.
<P>
   This adds the Macros7 template to the "Global Templates and Add-ins"
   box. Click OK.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Macro.

<P><LI>Change the "Macros Available In" line to show "Macros7.dot (Global
   Template)". Choose RegOptions listed under Macros and click Run.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The RegOptions macro incorrectly modifies the registry for the User
Templates path and the Workgroup Templates path. Do not use the RegOptions
macro to make these changes. Make the changes in Microsoft Word: On the
Tools menu, click Options, and then click File Locations.
