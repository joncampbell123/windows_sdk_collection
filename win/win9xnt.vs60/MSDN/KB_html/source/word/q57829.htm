The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.1, 6.0, 6.0.1,
   6.0.1a
<LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you change the point size of a word, sentence, or paragraph that
contains a superscript or subscript character that is formatted to be one
point size smaller than the rest of the text, the superscript or subscript
character may not change proportionally to a point size that is smaller
than the new point size. This problem will vary depending on how you
initially formatted the superscript or subscript character.
<P>
To automatically format superscript or subscript characters as one 
installed point size smaller than the text that accompanies them, use the 
following key commands:
<P>
<PRE>   Superscript   COMMAND+SHIFT+PLUS SIGN (+)

   Subscript     COMMAND+SHIFT+MINUS SIGN (-)

</PRE>To resize the entire word, sentence, or paragraph that contains the
superscript/subscript characters and retain the one-point-size-smaller
formatting:

<OL><P><LI>Format the text you want superscript/subscript using the appropriate key
   command above.
<P>
   NOTE: In Word 6.0 and 4.0, you must apply the key commands AFTER you
   have typed the text.

<P><LI>Select all of the text you want to resize.

<P><LI>Type the appropriate key command below:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - COMMAND+SHIFT+GREATER THAN (&gt;) -- to proportionally increase the
      point sizes of all the selected text
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - COMMAND+SHIFT+LESS THAN (&lt;) -- to proportionally decrease the
      point sizes of all the selected text
</PRE><P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The key combination COMMAND+SHIFT+PLUS SIGN (+) applies superscript
formatting to selected text by raising it 3 points above the baseline and
reducing the point size by one installed size (for example, from 12 point
to 10 point, from 10 point to 9 point, and so on).
<P>
The key combination COMMAND+SHIFT+MINUS SIGN (-) applies subscript
formatting to selected text by lowering it 2 points below the baseline
and reducing the point size by one installed size (for example, from
12 point to 10 point, from 10 point to 9 point, and so on).
<P>
<P><h3>Word 6.0</h3>
 
<P>
There are two ways to apply superscript or subscript to a character. One
way is to apply the superscript or subscript character format. You can
apply the superscript or subscript format using the keystrokes mentioned
above or by activating Superscript or Subscript in the Format Font dialog
under the Font tab. The superscript and subscript character formats
automatically change the character's point size.
<P>
When changing the point size of the sentence containing the super or
subscripted character, Word 6.0 automatically changes the point size of the
super or subscripted character to one size lower than the point size
applied. For more information on how Word 6.0 automatically changes the
point size, see the section on Word 4.0 below.
<P>
A second way to superscript and subscript is by raising or lowering the
position of the character. This is done under the Character Spacing tab in
the Format Font dialog. Applying superscript or subscript using Position
does NOT automatically change the size of the character.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 5.0</h3>
 
<P>
If [1] is formatted by selecting superscript or subscript from the Format
Character dialog box, or through a command that may have previously been
added to a menu, the font size of the selected characters will not
automatically decrease. (You will have to manually change the point size of
these characters.) In this case when you make the font size smaller for the
entire sentence, [1] will take on the point size that is chosen from the
Font menu.
<P>
This feature is by program design. It allows footnotes to automatically
maintain a size relative to the assigned size. If this feature were not
available, when you changed the font size of text by selecting the text and
selecting a new font size from the font menu, the font size of the footnote
reference marks would also take on this new size. In most cases, this not a
desired feature for footnotes.
<P>
<P><h3>Word 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
If you apply the superscript or subscript format to a character by typing
the character, selecting the text, and then using the key commands, Word
automatically adjusts the point size to be one installed point size smaller
than the current size. If you then select the entire sentence or paragraph
that contains the superscript or subscript character, and change the point
size of that sentence or character, Word will increase or decrease the font
size of the superscripted or subscripted character (it will remain one
point size smaller than the main text). For example, if you type the
following sentence in Times 12-point font
<P>
<PRE>   This is a test of the emergency broadcast system[1].

</PRE></OL>and make the character [1] superscript by selecting it and using the
key command SHIFT+COMMAND+PLUS SIGN, the character [1] will take on
the next installed point size down from 12 point (that is, 10 point).
If you then select the entire sentence and choose 10 Point from the
Font menu, the selected text will be reformatted in 10 point with the
exception of the [1] character, which will be 9 point.
<P>
CAUTION: If you use the key command COMMAND+SHIFT+PLUS SIGN before you
type the [1] character, the [1] character WILL NOT be reformatted as
9 point.
