The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,
   2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Word for Windows, the words entered for name and
organization are written to the Setup disk for security purposes unless the
Setup disk was write-protected before running the Setup program.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When installing Word for Windows, you are prompted to enter the name and
organization the product is licensed to. The information is written to the
Setup disk and cannot be edited or changed at a later date. This
information displays as follows when you run the program, and when you
choose About from the Help menu:
<P>
<PRE>   This copy of Microsoft Word is licensed to:

   Name
   Organization

</PRE>The only way to avoid having this information written to the Setup
disk is to write-protect the disk before running the Setup program. If
you run Setup from write-protected disks, you receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   System Error

   Write-protected disk in drive B:

</PRE>Choose the Cancel button twice to continue with the Word for Windows
Setup.
<P>
Word uses the information entered when setting up the program as the
default name for the Author field when you choose Summary Info from
the File menu. This information is editable and can be changed with
the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>From the Tools menu, choose Options.

<P><LI>Select User Info from the list of Categories.

<P><LI>Type the new information in the Name field.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL>This procedure sets the Author field in the Summary Info dialog box;
however, it does not change the licensee name.
<P>

Microsoft Knowledge Base:
