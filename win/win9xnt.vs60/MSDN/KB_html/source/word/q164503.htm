</PRE><h3>The Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit</h3>
 
<P>
If you're an administrator or an IS professional, this book was written
for you. Here you'll find the hands-on, in-depth information you need to
roll out, support, and troubleshoot Microsoft Office 97.
For systems running Microsoft Windows 95 and Microsoft Windows NT (3.51
and 4.0), this is the professional's guide to Microsoft Office 97. Here's
hands-on information about updating from earlier versions of Microsoft
Office, about switching from other applications such as Lotus 1-2-3 and
WordPerfect, and about coexistence among different versions of Microsoft
Office. Of course, you get full information on network installation, plus
the timesaving Network Installation Wizard on the enclosed CD-ROM. And
like all the tools and utilities on the CD-ROM, this wizard is a tested,
supported application designed to make your job easier.
