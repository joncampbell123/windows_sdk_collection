<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to create a hanging indent (often described as
an "F4 indent" or "F7 indent" by WordPerfect users). A hanging indent is a
paragraph that has a little text at the left, and the rest of the paragraph
is indented, as in the following example:

<OL><P><LI>&lt;TAB&gt;  text text text text text text text text text text text text
<PRE>           text text text text text text text text text text
 
 Education: &lt;TAB&gt; text text text text text text text text text text text
                  text text text text text text text text text text text
                  text text

</PRE></OL>In Microsoft Word 6.x, 7.x, and Word 97, Help for WordPerfect Users 
incorrectly indicates that you cannot indent a single line of a paragraph 
in Microsoft Word, and that a hanging indent is created by pressing CTRL+M 
(Windows) or COMMAND+M (Macintosh). This is incorrect.
<P>
You can create a hanging indent: the keystroke is CTRL+T (Windows) or 
COMMAND+T (Macintosh).
<P>

<UL><LI>Apply This Formatting Now
<LI>Customizing a Hanging Indent
<LI>Tips
<LI>Formatting Methods to Avoid
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Apply This Formatting Now</h3>
 
<P>
If you have already applied paragraph formatting to your text, remove it by 
selecting the paragraphs and pressing CTRL+Q (Windows) or OPTION+COMMAND+Q 
(Macintosh). Then use any of the following methods:

<UL><LI>If you want numbers to appear at the left of your text, use the
   automatic numbering feature in Word. Select the text and click the
   Numbering button on the Formatting tool bar. If you already had
   numbers applied to some or all of your text, Word may remove them.
   Click the Numbering button again to make the numbers come back.

<LI>If you want bullets to appear at the beginning of each paragraph, use
   the same method as above, but click the Bullets button instead.

<LI>If you have different text that you want to use along the left margin,
   select all the paragraphs, and press CTRL+T (Windows) or COMMAND+T
   (Macintosh). Then press the TAB key after the left-most text at the
   beginning of each line. This method is described in greater detail
   below.
<P>
</UL><h3>Customizing a Hanging Indent</h3>
 
<P>
If the default settings aren't in the right place for your document, you
can customize where the bulk of the text lines up. You can do this with the
mouse and the ruler, or with the Format menus.
<P>
With the Mouse and Ruler:

<OL><P><LI>In a sample paragraph, press CTRL+Q (Windows) or OPTION+COMMAND+Q
   (Macintosh).

<P><LI>Move the mouse to the ruler. Drag the bottom triangle and square to
   where you want the text to line up.

<P><LI>Between the text at the left and the rest of the paragraph, press
   the TAB key.
<P>
</OL>With the Format Menus:

<OL><P><LI>On the Format menu, click Paragraph.

<P><LI>Select the Indents and Spacing tab.

<P><LI>In the Special box (under Indentation), click Hanging. In the By
<PRE>   box, type the amount you want the text to move from the left margin       
   and then click OK.

</PRE><P><LI>Move the insertion point between the text on the left, and press the
   TAB key.
<P>
</OL><h3>Tips</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If the paragraph already has custom tabs, when you press CTRL+T, the
   second and subsequent lines move to the first tab stop.

<LI>If you indent too many times and want to go back one tab stop, press
   CTRL+SHIFT+T (Windows) or COMMAND+SHIFT+T (Macintosh).
<P>
</UL><h3>Formatting Methods to Avoid</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Do not use spaces to line up text. Using multiple spaces will cause
   text to wrap at odd points.

<LI>If you have more than one line of text that you want to appear at the
   left, don't use a hanging indent. A hanging indent only allows one
   line to appear by itself on the left. A table is better suited for
   this task; to create a table, click Insert Table on the Table menu.
