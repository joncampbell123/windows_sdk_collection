The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, Service Release 1 (SR-1)
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Word 97 SR-1 is now available. This article discusses where you can get
this updated version of Word and it also explains some of the differences
between the various versions of the update that are available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are three versions of SR-1 that you can use to update Word:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 SR-1 Patch
<P>
   -and-

<LI>Microsoft Office 97 SR-1 Enterprise Update
<P>
   -and-

<LI>Microsoft Word 97 SR-1
<P>
</UL>The main difference between these versions is that the patch will allow you
to update an existing (non-SR1) installation of Microsoft Word 97 to SR-1,
while the Enterprise Update and Word 97 SR-1 are complete versions of
the products and do not require an existing (non-SR1) installation.
<P>
NOTE: The SR-1 patch will not work on an administrative, run from network
server, or run from CD installation. For these types of installations you
will need the full SR-1 product.
<P>
<P><h2>WHICH UPDATE TO GET</h2>
 
<P>
The SR-1 download page on the Microsfot Web site, includes a patch version
checker tool. To use this tool, please see the following Microsoft World
Wide Web site:

</PRE>This tool determines which version of Word you have and then offers
appropriate advice about upgrading for that version. The following sections
include more information about upgrading.
