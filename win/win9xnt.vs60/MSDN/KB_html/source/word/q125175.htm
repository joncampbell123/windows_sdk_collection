The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SGML Author for Word, version 1.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
SGML is an international standard that describes the relationship between a
document's context and its structure in an open and vendor-neutral format.
Information can be shared across computer platforms and applications. This
delivers information solutions ranging from electronic publishing to
document repositories.
<P>
SGML Author for Word enables users to create documents in Word for Windows
6.0 and save them as SGML. Author provides the means to identify SGML
elements in the following ways:
<P>
<PRE>SGML Category            SGML Author Capacity
-------------            -----------------------

Attributes               Attributes are handled using Word's Private
                         Fields, which are designed to store information
                         that does not appear in the document. This enables
                         SGML Author users to insert Attributes into the
                         text stream without having to view them unless
                         they want to.

Entity References        SGML Author supports Entity References as long as
                         they are defined correctly in the DTD (Document
                         Type Definition) and the user enters the
                         appropriate Parameter Entity in the document text
                         stream.

ID/IDRef Pairs           SGML Author automatically converts Bookmarks to ID
                         Attributes and Ref Fields to IDRefs.

OLE Objects &amp; Pictures   OLE Objects and Pictures can be saved as *.CGM or
                         *.WMF graphic files, or they can be saved out as
                         binary files that Word can retrieve later.

Tables                   SGML Author supports a subset of the CALS table
                         model based on Word's table features.

International            SGML Author supports international characters
Characters               defined in the ISO character entity sets. All
                         glyphs in the ANSI character set above 127, the
                         Zapf Dingbats, WingDings, and Symbol fonts, and
                         some glyphs that are part of the Reference
                         Concrete Syntax are turned into character
                         entities.

Equations                SGML Author converts to and from the ISO standard
                         (ISO/IEL TR 9573-11:1992E) for representing
                         equations as SGML. You can also choose to export
                         equations as OLE Objects.

Mark-up Minimization     SGML Author supports SHORTTAG, OMITTAG, SHORTREF
                         on import and exports them as fully normalized
                         SGML. Datatag and rank are not supported by SGML
                         Author.

Marked Sections          SGML Author imports marked sections based on
                         whether they are marked as "Included" or
                         "Ignored."  SGML Author does not export marked
                         sections because Word does not support conditional
                         text.

Direct Formatting        All mark-up in Word documents must use either
                         Paragraph styles, or for inner paragraph mark-up,
                         Character styles. All direct formatting is
                         ignored.

Multiple DTD's           SGML Author can be configured to work with any DTD
                         using point-and-click tools.
