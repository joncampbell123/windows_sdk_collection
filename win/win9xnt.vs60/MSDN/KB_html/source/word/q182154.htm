The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you print a master document from master document view, Microsoft Word
will not print as expected, for example:

<UL><LI>Word will not print objects set as "Float over text" that have been
   inserted into subdocuments.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Word may not print the entire document.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Master document view is not designed to print your entire document. It is
designed for you to control the amount of detail you want to print.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Switch to either normal or page layout view, and then print the document.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Master document view helps you organize and maintain a long document, such
as a book or a multi-part report, that is divided into several smaller
documents called "subdocuments." In master document view, you can work in a
single document window and still see the overall organization of the
subdocuments. This view is not designed to print your entire document.
Master document view is designed for you to control the amount of detail
you want to print. For example, when you want to print just an outline,
collapse the information to show only what you want to print, and then when
you print from master document view, it will only print what is shown on
the screen.
<P>
NOTE: Word will not print objects that have the "Float over text" option
applied while in this view.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about master documents, click Contents And Index
on the Help menu (or on the Balloon Help menu if you are using a version of
the Macintosh operating system earlier than 8.0), click the Index button in
Word Help, type the following text
<P>
<PRE>   master documents, troubleshooting

</PRE>and then click Show Topics. Select the "Troubleshoot master documents"
topic, and click Go To. If you are unable to find the information you need,
ask the Office Assistant.
