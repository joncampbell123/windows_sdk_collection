The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you want the spelling checker to highlight words that the main
dictionary recognizes as being spelled correctly, but that you want
questioned during a spelling check, you must create an exclude dictionary.
Using an exclude dictionary allows you to specify preferred spellings for
certain words.
<P>
For example, if you prefer "theatre" rather than "theater," add "theater"
to the exclude dictionary so that Word will pause if it finds "theater"
during a spell check and will prompt you for the correct spelling.
<P>
Once you create an exclude dictionary, Word uses it automatically with the
main dictionary. If you want to check spelling without using the exclude
dictionary, rename the exclude dictionary before you check spelling in a
document.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To create an exclude dictionary, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In a new Word document, type the words that you want to put in the
   exclude dictionary. Press RETURN after each word.
<P>
   NOTE: Keep in mind that entries in the exclude dictionary are
   case-sensitive--that is, the spelling checker will question only text
   that exactly matches the uppercase and lowercase letters in each entry.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As.
<P>
   NOTE: You must save the exclude dictionary in the same folder that
   contains the main dictionary, usually located in the following folder:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Macintosh HD:Microsoft Office 98:Shared Applications:Proofing Tools
</PRE>
<P><LI>In the Save File As Type box, click Speller Exclude Dictionary.

<P><LI>In the Save Current Document As box, type a name for the exclude
   dictionary. Make sure to add "Exclude Dictionary" to the end of the
   exclude dictionary name. Also, it is a good idea to include the name of
   the main language dictionary it's associated with.
<P>
   For example, if you are saving an exclude dictionary for the main
   English (US) dictionary, name your exclude dictionary as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      English (US) Exclude Dictionary
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click Save.

<P><LI>Close the file and restart Word. The exclude dictionary will not be
   available until you restart Word.
<P>
</OL>You can use this procedure to find correctly spelled words that you want
the spelling checker to question (for example, if you often type "widow"
when you mean to type "window"). After you add "widow" to the exclude
dictionary, the spelling checker will question it the next time you check
spelling in your document.
<P>
NOTE: Keep in mind that Word does not question single letters even though
you have placed them in your exclude dictionary.
