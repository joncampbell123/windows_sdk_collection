<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-cd, 2.0b, 2.0c,

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the WordBasic command, CopyFile, the copy of the file does not
have an extension. As a result, the copied file loses its association with
Microsoft Word and becomes a generic Windows 95 file. The following code
results in this problem:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub MAIN
   CopyFile "c:\storage\test.doc", "c:\temp"
   End Sub

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the "Hide MS-DOS file extensions for file types
that are registered" is checked in Windows Explorer. (To locate this
option, in Windows Explorer, click Options on the View menu.)
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word for Windows
95 version 7.0. This problem was corrected in Word version 7.0a for Windows
95.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use one of the following methods to preserve
the copied file's association with Microsoft Word.
<P>
Method 1. Make sure the "Hide MS-DOS file extensions for file types that
<PRE>          are registered" option in Windows Explorer is not checked.

</PRE>Method 2. Use the Declare command to make a CopyFileA call to
<PRE>          Kernel32.dll. To do this, use the following macro:

          NOTE: The sample assumes that you have a Microsoft Word document
          called "Test.doc" located in the C:\Storage folder.

          Declare Function CopyFileA Lib "kernel32"(a$ As String, b$ As
          String, n As Integer) As Integer

          Sub MAIN
             x = CopyFileA("c:\storage\test.doc", "c:\temp\test.doc ", 3)
          End Sub

          NOTE: Using a number greater than 0 in the above example will not
          overwrite an existing file. The file specified as the destination
          remains the same. However, if 0 is used, as in the example below,
          the destination file will be overwritten by the specified file if
          it exists in the specified directory.

          Declare Function CopyFileA Lib "kernel32"(a$ As String, b$ As
          String, n As Integer) As Integer

          Sub MAIN
             x = CopyFileA("a:\test.doc", "c:\test.doc ", 0)
          End Sub
