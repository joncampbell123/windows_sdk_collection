The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Macintosh, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.1, 6.0, 6.0.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses methods of copying styles between two existing
documents. You can transfer an entire style sheet (including standard
styles and custom styles), or you can transfer individual styles.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Each Word document has a style sheet, which contains the specific styles
for that document. When you open a new document, Word forms the style
sheet, consisting of styles as follows:

<UL><LI>Default custom styles (styles that you have named and made default
   styles)

<LI>Standard styles (styles such as Normal, Heading 1, and Footnote Text,
   which are built into the Word program)
<P>
</UL>To modify styles in a document, you must have that document currently open.
If you want to import styles from a different document, try one or more of
the following techniques:
<P>
<P><h3>Copying a Style Sheet into a Document</h3>
 
<P>
To copy a style sheet from one document (the source) to another document
(the destination), follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the destination document.

<P><LI>From the Format menu, choose Styles (in Word 4.0, choose Define Styles).

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Open.

<P><LI>Select the source document.

<P><LI>Click Open.
<P>
</OL>Word copies all the styles from the source-document style sheet into the
destination-document style sheet. Styles from an incoming style sheet
replace styles with the same name in the destination document.
<P>
<P><h3>Copying Individual Styles into a Document</h3>
 
<P>
To copy a custom style into a document, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>If Paragraph Marks are off, choose Show Paragraph Mark from the View
   menu (the Edit menu in Word 4.0).

<P><LI>In the document containing the style, press RETURN to create a blank
   line and highlight its paragraph mark.

<P><LI>Using the Style box on the ruler, apply the style to the paragraph.

<P><LI>With the paragraph mark highlighted, choose Copy from the Edit menu.

<P><LI>Open the destination document.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Paste.
<P>
</OL>By pasting the paragraph formatted with the style, the style is added to
the destination document's style sheet. The paragraph mark can be removed.
When copying styles using the Clipboard, you can also copy text along with
a paragraph mark, and even copy a number of differently styled paragraph
marks to copy several styles at once.
<P>
Copying a style with the same name does not override the style in the
destination document. As a result, this technique does not work for
replacing custom or standard styles having the same names in the
destination document.
<P>
NOTE: Page 188 of "Microsoft Word User's Guide" for Word versions 5.x
states that when you copy an entire document, or more than 50 paragraphs of
a document, the copied styles override the formats of the same-named styles
in the destination document. This does not occur consistently. Microsoft is
trying to define this problem more precisely and will post more information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it become available.
<P>
<P><h3>Word for Macintosh 6.x</h3>
 
<P>
In Word for Macintosh 6.x, you can use the organizer to copy styles from
documents or templates.  To merge styles created in a Microsoft Word for
Macintosh 6.x document with those in another document, open the document
to which you want to copy the styles and do the following:

<OL><P><LI>From the Format menu, choose Style.

<P><LI>Choose the Organizer button.

<P><LI>On the To: side of the dialog, choose the Close File button to close
   the file listed. The Close File button will change to an Open File
   button, choose this button.

<P><LI>Select or type in the name of the file from which you would like to
   copy styles. You can choose Word Document or Document Template from
   the List Files of Type box.

<P><LI>Choose OK.

<P><LI>Select the style or styles you would like to copy to your open
   document and choose the Copy button. Choose Yes or Yes to All when
   prompted to overwrite existing styles.

<P><LI>When all desired styles have been copied, choose Close.
