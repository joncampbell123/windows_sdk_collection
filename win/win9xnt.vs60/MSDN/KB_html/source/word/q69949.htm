<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The overtype command does not work in Word for Windows when recorded
as a macro.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the versions of
Microsoft Word for Windows listed above. We are researching this
problem and will post more information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Overtyping is used for typing new text over existing text. One way
this mode can be activated in Word for Windows is by pressing the INS
key on the keyboard. When this key is activated, the status bar will
display OVR (overtype) and all typing will replace previously typed
text.
<P>
When this action is recorded as a macro, however, the overtype mode is
turned on but does not record overtyped text.
<P>
To demonstrate this, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>From a Word for Windows document, choose Record from the Macro menu.

<P><LI>Type the word Test and press the HOME key.

<P><LI>Press the INS key and type the word Case. Notice that the letters
   OVR appear on the status bar and that Test is replaced with the
   word Case.

<P><LI>From the Macro menu, choose Stop Recorder.

<P><LI>Press the INS key again to remove overtype and run the macro.
<P>
</OL>Notice the overtype command does not work. Case is typed next to the
word Test instead of typing over it, even though OVR is now displayed
in the status bar. Overtype mode is turned on when the macro is run,
but the actual overtyping is not recorded.
