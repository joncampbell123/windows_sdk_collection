About Avalanche SURESTYLE (Preview)
 
<P>
SURESTYLE(TM) is a utility developed by Avalanche Development Co. that
helps you standardize the use of styles--both paragraph and character--in
your Word documents. The sample version of Avalanche SURESTYLE, called
SURESTYLE (Preview), which is included on the CD in your package,
demonstrates the full functionality of the product. SURESTYLE (Preview) is
also available direct from Avalanche on 3.5" disks; shipping charges apply.
You can also obtain the full version of the product, SURESTYLE version 1.0,
direct from Avalanche for $495 in the USA and Canada; shipping charges
apply. Contact Avalanche Development Co., at the address below.
<P>
When you run SURESTYLE (Preview) on your document, the utility analyzes and
processes the first seven pages and creates a new version of the document
in which appropriate character and paragraph styles have been applied. The
new document also includes annotations that give you an opportunity to
review the changes SURESTYLE has made.
<P>
Just as the spell-checker compares the words it finds to a known list of
words and reports back the discrepancies, SURESTYLE compares the objects it
finds to a known set of object descriptions (the stylesheet). Using the
stylesheet specified by the template attached to the document, SURESTYLE
applies the paragraph and character styles that most closely match each
object's formatting. SURESTYLE saves the results into a new file, which
contains Word annotations that note the style differences between the
original file and the new file. You can write documents in a way that is
familiar and comfortable to you, then use SURESTYLE to bring the documents
into conformity with a standard-- which in this case is defined by the
stylesheet.
<P>
The power and configurability of SURESTYLE version 1.0 gives you the
flexibility to direct and fine-tune the style-checking process by:
<P>
<PRE>  *  Enabling custom configuration through a visual interface

  *  Helping workgroups coordinate different authoring styles and templates

  *  Enforcing usage by "driving" styles into the correct template

  *  Normalizing different forms of legacy documents by transforming them
     into a single, preferred form

</PRE><h3>To install SureSTYLE</h3>
 
<P>
From the Windows Program Manager, select File/Run and type
x:\surestyl\surestyl.exe (where x is the CD-ROM drive designation) then
follow the instructions that appear on your screen.
<P>
<P><h3>Using SURESTYLE</h3>
 
<P>
After using Word to create a document, choose SureSTYLE from the Format
menu, and then click OK in the initial dialog box. SureSTYLE will make a
copy of your current document and use the annotation feature in Word to
explain the modifications made. To see these annotations, click Annotations
on the View menu. If you want to remove the annotations from your document,
click Clear SureSTYLE Annotations on the Tools menu.
