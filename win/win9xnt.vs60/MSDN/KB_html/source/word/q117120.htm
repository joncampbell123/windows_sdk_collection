The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Temporary files that begin with a tilde (~) and have a .WIZ extension have
appeared in the directory where your Word for Windows wizards are stored
(usually, C:\WINWORD\TEMPLATE).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you create a new document in Word, Word creates an owner file.
Information you enter into the wizard during its operation as well as
information about who is currently using the file is stored in the owner
file. This file remains until you save the document or quit Word. Closing
all open documents within Word has no effect.
<P>
Normally, you can add NoOwnerFiles=Yes to the Microsoft Word 6.0 section of
the WINWORD6.INI file to prevent the creation of hidden owner files.
However, this option does not work when you use the wizards.
<P>
For additional information about hidden temporary files and why they
sometimes accumulate on your hard disk, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Hidden Temporary Files Left on Hard Drive

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem, and we will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
The wizard owner files do not generally pose a problem to system operation.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
Method 1: Rename the wizard to have a DOT extension. The drawback to this
<PRE>          method is that you will lose the Wizard's functionality.

</PRE>Method 2: Call the wizard from a macro stored in another template. The
<PRE>          macro below should be stored globally (in the NORMAL.DOT
          template). It calls the Wizard, reattaches to the Normal
          template, changes the hidden attribute of the wizard owner files,
          and removes the owner files after completing the StartWizard
          macro.

          Sub MAIN
          FileNewDefault
          FileTemplates .Store = 0, .Template = "c:\public\mywizard.wiz",
          .LinkStyles = 0
          Call StartWizard.MAIN
          FileTemplates .Store = 0, .Template = "NORMAL", .LinkStyles = 0
          On Error Resume Next
          SetAttr "c:\public\~$wizard.wiz", 0
          Kill "c:\public\~$wizard.wiz"
          End Sub

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Wizard owner files are hidden files that are 54 bytes in length and are
stored in the same directory as the wizard. The files are named after the
wizard that is in use, but the first two letters are changed to ~$. For
example, AWARD.WIZ would have an owner file named ~$ard.wiz.
