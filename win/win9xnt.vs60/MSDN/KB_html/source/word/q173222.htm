The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you format a section in a document for multiple columns with Line
Between Columns enabled and

<UL><LI>you insert a next page section break
<P>
   -and-

<LI>you format the following section in landscape orientation,
<P>
</UL>the Line Between Columns in the previous section will not appear on the
screen or print on the last page of the multiple column section.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is related to the landscape orientation of the section
following the section formatted for multiple columns with Line Between
Columns enabled.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You can work around the problem by using one of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Insert an Additional Break</h3>
 
<P>
Insert an additional continuous section break before the next page
section break (the one that starts the landscape section). To do this,
click Break on the Insert menu, and select Continuous.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Draw a Line Using the Drawing Tools</h3>
 
<P>
You can turn on the drawing toolbar and use the Line tool to draw a
vertical black line in between the columns. After you draw the vertical
line, you can adjust the formatting for the line by following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Right-click the vertical line and click Format AutoShape.

<P><LI>Click the Colors And Lines tab.

<P><LI>Adjust the Style and Weight to achieve the desired result.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
