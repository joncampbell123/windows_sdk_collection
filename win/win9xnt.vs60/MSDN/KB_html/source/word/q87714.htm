<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word for Windows uses information from the Registration
Database file (REG.DAT) for its object-linking-and-embedding (OLE)
activities. In Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, REG.DAT
provides the information used by File Manager and Print Manager to
support drag-and-drop functionality. When you first install Windows
3.1, the REG.DAT file contains information about all the OLE
applications included with Windows. You should never move or delete
REG.DAT; doing so can result in loss of functionality in File Manager,
Program Manager, and applications that support OLE.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Word for Windows Setup program updates the REG.DAT file by adding
information about the program and the OLE server applications
(Microsoft Graph, Microsoft Draw, Microsoft WordArt, and Microsoft
Equation Editor) that ship with Word for Windows. During network
installation, Setup updates REG.DAT for the server or workstation,
depending on where Windows is installed. If your WINDOWS directory is
flagged as read only, Word for Windows Setup cannot update the REG.DAT
file, nor can it copy the OLE server application files to the WINDOWS
subdirectories. If this occurs, Word for Windows Setup generates an
error message.
<P>
If you cannot launch the OLE server applications from Word for
Windows, you may need to update REG.DAT. To do this, use the
Registration Info Editor (REGEDIT.EXE) program, which ships with
Windows 3.1. You can also reconstruct the REG.DAT file by running Word
for Windows Setup to reinstall the program.
<P>
Important Note: If you move any OLE server applications, you must
update the REG.DAT file so that Word for Windows can locate them.
<P>
<P>
To update REG.DAT using REGEDIT.EXE, use the steps below.
<P>
Note: Be sure to make a backup copy of the REG.DAT file before you use
these instructions.

<OL><P><LI>From the Program Manager File menu, choose Run.

<P><LI>In the Command Line box, type "REGEDIT" (without the quotation
   marks), then choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Under Registered File Types, select the file type you want to
   update (for example, Word Document).

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Modify File Type.

<P><LI>Type the correct location in the Command box, or choose the Browse
   button to locate the program file. (For example, for Word Document,
   locate the WINWORD.EXE file.) Choose the OK button.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Exit. Your changes are written to the
   REG.DAT file at this time.
<P>
</OL>Note: CheckFree software uses a non-Windows-related file called
REG.DAT. Be sure to select the correct REG.DAT file if you have both
Windows and CheckFree. CheckFree is manufactured by CheckFree
Corporation, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty,
implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
