The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Sometimes when you close and then reopen a Word for Windows document that
contains an embedded object (that is, the result of an {EMBED} field), the
embedded object may become a blank box in the reopened document. If you
double-click the blank box to edit it, Word displays the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Word cannot edit the &lt;object type&gt; object.

</PRE>If you select the blank box and press DEL to remove it, the following error
message occurs:
<P>
<PRE>   Word has insufficient memory. You will not be able to undo this
   action once it is completed. Do you want to continue?

</PRE>If you choose Yes, Word deletes the object. If you choose No, Word displays
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   There are too many edits in the document. This operation will
   be incomplete. Save your work.

</PRE>If you save the document, the following error message occurs:
<P>
<PRE>   The disk is full trying to write to C:. Free some space on this
   drive or save the document on a different disk.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem happens if you do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Before you close the document, cut the embedded object (from the Edit
   menu, choose Cut).

<P><LI>Close the document, and choose No when Word prompts you to save changes.

<P><LI>Reopen the document. If the embedded object is still on the Windows
   Clipboard, the object displays as a blank box in Word when you reopen
   the document.
<P>
</OL>The problem does not occur if you delete the object from the Windows
Clipboard or replace it with something else before you reopen the Word
document. Moreover, the problem does not occur if you copy the embedded
object (by choosing Copy from the Edit menu) instead of cutting it as
described in step 1 above.
<P>
Important: This is NOT the same as the problem in which a Word 2.x document
object becomes corrupt after you edit it in Word 6.0. For more information
about this separate problem, query on the following words in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   object and corrupt and editing and officeinterop and container

</PRE></OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Word versions 6.0, 6.0a and
6.0c for Windows. This problem was corrected in Word version 7.0 for
Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Once it appears as a blank box, you cannot recover the embedded object in
your document. If the embedded object still exists on the Clipboard, you
can paste a new copy into your document and delete the blank box using the
instructions in Method 1 below. If the embedded object no longer exists on
the Clipboard, you must re-create the embedded object or insert it again by
choosing the Object command on the Insert menu and selecting the Create
From File tab.
<P>
Method 1: If you reopen a document and notice that Word is displaying an
<PRE>          embedded object as a blank box, immediately do the following:

          a. Position the insertion point on a blank line in the document
             (for example, press ENTER to create a blank line under the
             embedded object).

          b. From the Edit menu, choose Paste. If your embedded object
             still exists on the Clipboard, Word pastes it in your document
             correctly.

          c. Select the blank box and press DEL. When the following
             error message appears, choose the Yes button:

                Word has insufficient memory. You will not be able to undo
                this action once it is completed. Do you want to continue?

          c. Save your document. No error message should occur.

</PRE>Method 2: To avoid this problem in the future, use the following
<PRE>          instructions to remove the embedded object from the Windows
          Clipboard before you reopen the Word document that contains the
          object:

          a. Open a different Word document.

             -or-

             Create a new Word document and type some text in it.

          b. Select several characters.

          c. From the Edit menu, choose Copy or Cut. This replaces the
             embedded object with the current selection.

          d. Close the document.

          e. Reopen the Word document that contains the embedded object.

          For more information about the Windows Clipboard, see your
          Windows documentation.
