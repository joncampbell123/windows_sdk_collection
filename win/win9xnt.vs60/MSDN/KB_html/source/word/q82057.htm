The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following is the complete text of the file ReadMe Before
Installation. This file is located on the Install disk of Microsoft
Word for the Macintosh version 5.0. It is a text document, and the
application TeachText is also on the Install disk for viewing the file
before installation.
<P>
BEFORE YOU INSTALL MICROSOFT WORD FOR THE MACINTOSH
<P>
This document contains information you need before installing
Microsoft Word for the Macintosh. This document is one of several
files that come with Word to provide complementary or late-breaking
information as a supplement to the standard Word documentation. The
Install program installs these documents in the Word folder on your
hard disk.
<P>
SEE...
<P>
<PRE> * "Word 5 ReadMe" for information available since publication of the
   books in the Word package

 * "Conversion Information" for information about file conversion
   limitations and specialized conversion options

 * "Formula Glossary Information" for information about entries in the
   Formula Glossary (see the Glossaries folder)

 * "Page Layout Glossary Info" for information about entries in the
   Page Layout Glossary  (see the Glossaries folder)

 * "Mailing Labels ReadMe" for information about using the mailing
   labels stationery documents (see the Mailing Labels folder in the
   Sample Documents folder)

</PRE>BEFORE INSTALLING WORD
<P>
<PRE> * Before you start the Installer program, move all virus protection
   software out of your System folder to another folder, and then
   restart your computer. The Installer will not be able to install
   Word even if your virus protection software is running in notify
   mode only.

 * Some System Extensions, also knows as INITs, may be incompatible
   with the Installer. To turn off all INITs, restart your computer
   while holding down the SHIFT key.

 * There are known incompatibilities between the Apple Installer
   program and the Radius Rocket board. If you have a Radius Rocket
   board installed, turn off Radius Rocket before running the
   Installer.

 * If you are installing from a network, make sure the Chooser is
   closed before running the Installer.

 * After the installation is completed, depending on your
   configuration, you may be asked to restart your computer. In these
   cases, the Installer program will close all active applications
   before restarting your computer.

</PRE>INSTALLING WORD
<P>
To install Word, double-click on the Installer icon on this disk, and
then follow the instructions. The default installation option is Easy
Install, which installs all Word commands and information documents,
and many file converters. See "Easy Install," below for a list of
installed files. If you want to install only some files, you can
choose the Customize option, and then choose what to install. The
Installer prompts you to specify where to install Word, and, after you
do, copies all files from your install disks to your hard disk. The
Installer decompresses the files (which are compressed for shipping)
after copying them. Decompression takes at least 10 minutes. When all
files are decompressed, the Installer may ask you to restart your
computer.
<P>
If needed, you can run the Installer again to add documents,
commands, or file converters to your Word installation. You must use
the Installer to add these.
<P>
Note: When installing Word, the "Embedding Preferences" and the "Word
Settings (5)" files are added to the System folder. Installing the
Equation Editor adds the font "MT Extra" and the file "MTExt" to the
System folder. Installing Voice Annotations adds the "Voice Record"
file to the System folder and the Voice Annotation Resources to the
System.
<P>
DISK SPACE REQUIRED DURING INSTALLATION
<P>
To install and decompress files, Word needs enough disk space for
both the compressed and the uncompressed version of the files. If you
don't have enough disk space for the Easy Install option, use the
Customize option to install everything except Voice Annotations and
Equation Editor. You can then run the Installer again to install
these packages.
<P>
If you select the Customize option in the Installer, the size
displayed in the install window is the total amount of disk space
needed during installation of a selected package. The files included
in the package will occupy significantly less disk space once
installed.
<P>
STARTING WORD
<P>
When you start Word, you may get the message "Microsoft Word prefers
[#] K of memory. [#] K is available. Do you want to open it using the
available memory?" If you cannot or do not want to run Word in the
available memory, use the procedure below to increase the memory
allocation for Word.

<OL><P><LI>If Word is running, choose Quit from the File menu.

<P><LI>In the Finder, select the Microsoft Word icon.

<P><LI>From the File menu in the Finder, choose Get Info.

<P><LI>In the lower right corner of the Get Info dialog box, change the
   current memory size.

<P><LI>Close the Get Info dialog box.
<P>
</OL>NEW WORD ICONS
<P>
If you have an older version of Word installed on your hard disk, you
may still see the old Word icons in the Finder. To see the new icons,
restart your computer and hold down COMMAND+OPTION while your
computer restarts. When you see a dialog box asking you if you want
to rebuild your desktop, choose OK. Note that if you rebuild your
desktop, the Finder also erases all comments in the Finder Info
boxes. If you still see the old icons on your desktop, you may
consider removing the older versions of Word, and then rebuilding
your desktop again.

</PRE>CUSTOM INSTALL
<P>
Many documents and commands are installed to the Word Commands folder
in the Word folder. If you use the Customize option to install one of
these documents or commands, the Installer creates a Word Commands
folder in the folder which you choose as the installation folder. If
you choose a Word Commands folder as your installation folder, the
Installer will place the command or document directly in this folder.
