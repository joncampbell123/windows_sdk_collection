The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Word 5 Installer hangs (stops responding) while installing the Equation
Editor fonts on a Power Macintosh.
<P>
<PRE> -or-

</PRE>The following error message occurs:
<P>
<PRE>   An error occurred while installing on the active startup disk "&lt;hard
   disk name&gt;". Installation was not able to be completed, but your
   original software has been restored.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if you are using Word on a Power Macintosh. The Apple
Installer that Word uses is incompatible with the Virtual Memory feature in
some modes.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To force the Word Installer to quit so that you can try again:

<OL><P><LI>Hold down the OPTION+COMMAND keys and press ESC.

<P><LI>When a dialog box appears asking you to confirm the force quit, choose
   the Force Quit button.
<P>
</OL>After you quit the Word Installer, use one of the following methods to
successfully run the Installer:
<P>
Method 1:
<P>
Disable the Modern Memory Manager and the Virtual Memory option in the
Memory control panel and run the Installer again.
<P>
NOTE: If you are running System 7.6 or later, the Modern Memory Manager is
always on, and you cannot disable it.
<P>
Method 2:
<P>
Remove the Embedding Preferences file from the System:Preferences
folder; remove the MT Extra Font from the System:Fonts folder.
<P>
Method 3:
<P>
Increase the memory assigned to the Installer program.
<P>
NOTE: Method 4 is suggested if you receive the error message.
<P>
Method 4:
<P>
Run the Installer again, but this time custom install Word and do
not install any System Resources.
<P>

<P><h3>To disable the Virtual Memory feature on the Power Macintosh</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the Apple menu, choose Control Panels.

<P><LI>Double-click the Memory control panel.

<P><LI>In the Virtual Memory section, select Off.

<P><LI>Close the Memory control panel.

<P><LI>Restart the computer.
<P>
</OL><h3>To disable the Modern Memory Manager feature on the Power Macintosh</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the Apple menu, choose Control Panels.

<P><LI>Double-click the Memory control panel.

<P><LI>In the Modern Memory Manager section, select Off.

<P><LI>Close the Memory control panel.

<P><LI>Restart the Power Mac.
<P>
</OL><h3>To remove the Embedding Preferences and MT Extra font</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Drag the Embedding Preferences file to the Trash. This file is
   located in the Preferences folder (System 7) or in the System
   Folder (System 6)

<P><LI>Drag the MT Extra font to the Trash. This file is located in the
   Fonts folder or in the System Suitcase in the System Folder.
<P>
</OL><h3>To run the Installer again and set the memory</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the Install disk in the Word 5.x disk set, select the Installer
   icon.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Get Info.

<P><LI>In the Preferred box, change the memory setting to 1300. Close the
   window.

<P><LI>Start the Installer to install Word 5.x.
<P>
</OL><h3>To run a Custom Installation</h3>
 
<P>
The Installer in Word 5.1 has a custom option to install all of Word's
components without the System resources, called "Complete Install (No Sys.
Resources)." This installation option does not interfere with the Virtual
Memory feature and, therefore, installs properly with Virtual Memory on;
however, the Equation Editor fonts and the capability to make voice
annotations will be missing after such an installation.
<P>
After you complete the first phase of the Custom Installation, you will be
prompted with a screen that asks if you want to continue with the
installation or quit. Clicking Continue will return you to the Custom
Installation screen. Clicking Quit will quit the Installer.
<P>
Scroll the list of Custom options and select "System Resources for System
6.0.6 and later." This phase of the operation will install the Equation
Editor fonts and the Voice Annotations files. This phase combined with the
first phase equals a complete Easy Install.
<P>
IMPORTANT: Do not forget to reset the Virtual Memory settings to their
original configuration. When you use the Power Macintosh, programs will
require twice as much memory if Virtual Memory is turned off.
