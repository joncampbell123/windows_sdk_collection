The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to find the definition of a word, you receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Word cannot find or run the application.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You may not have installed Microsoft Bookshelf 98. Before you can look up
the definition of a word, you must have installed Microsoft Bookshelf 98,
Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition (or Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh
Edition), and the Bookshelf integration file from the ValuPack.
<P>
NOTE: Microsoft Bookshelf 98 is a separate Microsoft program and is not
included with Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition or Microsoft Word 98
Macintosh Edition.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Install Microsoft Bookshelf 98.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Bookshelf is a multimedia reference collection with online books
and materials. To find information, you can search for titles in a table of
contents, or you can search for contents in a single reference or in all
references at once.
<P>
When you install Microsoft Bookshelf 98, Microsoft Office 98, and the
Bookshelf integration file, special Bookshelf commands are added to Word.
Click Look Up Reference on the Tools menu to look up information in
Bookshelf without leaving your document. You can also press CONTROL and
click a word in your document, and then click Define on the shortcut menu
to quickly find a definition for a word. Plus, you can copy entire articles
or selected text and images from Bookshelf directly to a new or existing
file, and Bookshelf will automatically include copyright information in
your file.
<P>
When you install the Bookshelf integration file, the Microsoft Reference
Library file is added to the System Folder:Extensions folder. To install
the Bookshelf integration file, run the Value Pack Installer located in the
ValuPack folder on the Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition (or Microsoft
Word 98 Macintosh Edition) CD, and then click to select the Bookshelf
Integration check box.
<P>
For more information about using Bookshelf with Word, click the Office
Assistant, type "Bookshelf Integration," click Search, and then click to
view one of the Bookshelf topics.
<P>
NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Microsoft Help is not installed on your computer,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
