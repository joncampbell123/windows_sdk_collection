<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains instructions you can use to print envelopes in
Word for Windows using the Create Envelope command on a Panasonic
KX-P4450 or KX-P4450i printer with the following configurations:

<UL><LI>KX-P4450 using PCL4X.DRV version 1.10 and optional envelope tray

<LI>KX-P4450i using PCL4X.DRV version 1.10 and optional envelope tray
   or manual feed slot on standard paper tray

<LI>KX-P4450i using HP LaserJet Series IID printer driver

<LI>KX-P4450 using HP LaserJet Series IID printer driver
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Panasonic KX-P4450 and KX-P4450i printers recognize the optional
envelope tray only when it is in the lower paper tray slot. The
KX-P4450i also has a manual feed slot on top of the standard paper
tray that you can use to print envelopes.
<P>
The envelope tray accommodates the following range of envelope
dimensions:
<P>
<PRE>   Height:  3 1/4 inches  to  4 7/16 inches
   Length:  8 inches      to  10 inches

</PRE>For best results, you should use the Panasonic KX-P4450/4450i printer
driver version 1.10 (PCL4X.DRV), available on the Windows Driver
Library (WDL). You should also use version 3.1.2 or later of the
Windows Universal Printer Driver (UNIDRV.DLL). For information on
obtaining the WDL, query on the following words in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   obtain and msdl and information and wdl.txt

</PRE>No printer heuristics are necessary to print envelopes (or to perform
any other printing procedure) on either printer. You should remove any
"PCL4X" printer heuristic settings from the [Microsoft Word 2.0]
section of your WIN.INI file.
<P>
<P><h2>KX-P4450 Using PCL4X.DRV Version 1.10</h2>
 
<P>
You must always modify the settings on the front panel of the
Panasonic KX-P4450 to correctly print envelopes using the Create
Envelope command in Word. This is necessary because the printer cannot
recognize any command to reset paper source and orientation settings
when the envelope tray is installed.
<P>
<P><h3>Printer Setup</h3>
 
<P>
Use the following instructions to set up the KX-P4450 to print
envelopes in Word:

<OL><P><LI>Install the PCL4X.DRV driver, using the instructions in the
   "Installing a Printer Driver" section of the PRINTER.TXT file,
   supplied with the printer driver.

<P><LI>Start Word.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Print Setup. Select Panasonic KX-P4450
   from the Printer list and then choose the Setup button.

<P><LI>In the printer driver dialog box, choose the Options button. Select
   the Print True Type as Graphics option and then choose OK three
   times to return to the Word document.
<P>
   Note: This step is necessary for all documents (not just for
   envelopes) if you want to print using any TrueType fonts.
   This printer cannot print downloaded TrueType fonts.
<P>
</OL><h3>Print Envelopes</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Install the envelope tray in the lower paper tray slot on the
   printer.

<P><LI>Press the Online button on the printer so the Online light is off.

<P><LI>Press the Reset button on the front panel of the printer to
   initialize the envelope tray.

<P><LI>Press the Online button so the Online light is on. The printer is
   now in Panasonic LP (Landscape) mode.

<P><LI>Use the Create Envelope command in Word to create and print your
   envelopes.
<P>
</OL><h3>Reset the Printer for Normal Document Printing</h3>
 
<P>
After you print envelopes to the envelope tray, you must reset the
printer manually using the following procedure. If you do not reset
the printer before you print a normal document (in either portrait or
landscape orientation), the document text begins printing at the
location where an envelope would begin printing.

<OL><P><LI>Press the Online button on the printer so the Online light is off.

<P><LI>Press the Format button on the printer.

<P><LI>Press the UP ARROW button on the printer to select the Portrait
   setting.

<P><LI>Press the large Enter button on the printer and then press the Exit
   button.

<P><LI>Press the Online button so the Online light is on.
<P>
</OL><h3>Alternate Method for Resetting Printer for Document Printing</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Remove the envelope tray.

<P><LI>Press the Online button on the printer so the Online light is off.

<P><LI>Press the Reset button on the front panel of the printer to re-
   initialize the printer without the envelope tray.

<P><LI>Press the Online button so the Online light is on.
<P>
</OL><h2>KX-P4450i Using PCL4X.DRV Version 1.10</h2>
 
<P>
You do not need to manually reset the Panasonic KX-P4450i to print
envelopes using the envelope tray. This printer automatically resets
the origin location, paper source, and orientation settings after you
print an envelope or a document using a different paper tray or
Page Setup settings.
<P>
On the KX-P4450i, if you insert an envelope in the manual feed slot on
top of the standard paper tray, the printer feeds from that source to
print an envelope even if the envelope tray is installed.
<P>
<P><h2>KX-P4450i Using the HP IID Printer Driver</h2>
 
<P>
If the PCL4X.DRV version 1.10 printer driver is not available, you can
print envelopes in Word using the HP LaserJet Series IID printer
driver. This printer driver accesses either paper tray and prints
envelopes correctly on the Panasonic KX-P4450i printer.
<P>
<P><h2>KX-P4450 Using the HP IID Printer Driver</h2>
 
<P>
When you print envelopes on the KX-P4450 using the HP LaserJet Series
IID printer driver, you must reset the printer manually using the
procedures described above in the "KX-P4450 Using PCL4X.DRV Version
1.10" section.
<P>
If you print envelopes (or any other document in landscape
orientation) on the KX-P4450 using the HP LaserJet Series IID printer
driver, you can only use the built-in printer fonts (Courier and
LinePrinter). The KX-P4450 is similar to the HP LaserJet Series II
printer in that it cannot internally rotate fonts for landscape
printing; both printers use landscape fonts that are built into the
printer. When you use the HP IID printer driver, which relies on the
printer to rotate fonts to landscape, the KX-P4450 substitutes its
internal landscape printer fonts.
<P>
For information on changing the default envelope fonts, query on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
