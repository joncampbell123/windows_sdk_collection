<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The information contained in this article is reprinted from the Adobe
Type Manager (R) 1.15 Release Notes. Adobe Type Manager (ATM) is a
registered trademark of Adobe Systems Incorporated. Copyright

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability. For more information, contact
Adobe Systems technical support at (408) 986-6530.
<P>
Note:  According to Adobe Technical Support, versions of ATM prior to
2.0 have not been tested and are not guaranteed compatibility under
Windows 3.1.

<P><h2>General Hints and Tips</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Times Versus Tms Rmn</h3>
 
<P>
Both Times and Tms Rmn appear on your applications' font menus when
ATM is on. ATM automatically substitutes Times whenever it sees Tms
Rmn (for compatibility with existing documents); it is more reliable
to select Times than Tms Roman. The same is true for Helvetica vs.
Helv.
<P>
<P><h3>Maximum Number of Fonts</h3>
 
<P>
ATM version 1.15 can install a maximum of 1500 fonts. However, Windows
limits the number of PostScript soft font entries in your WIN.INI file
to approximately 175. If you get spurious printer error messages when
starting your application or switching to a PostScript printer, you
may have reached this limit. If you have too many fonts installed to
the driver, your font drop down box in Word for Windows appears blank
(empty); no choices are available.
<P>
Turn off ATM, and restart Windows. If the condition persists, you must
manually remove these entries from your WIN.INI file.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows Vector Fonts</h3>
 
<P>
To eliminate the "stick-figure" appearance of the Roman and Modern
Windows fonts, ATM substitutes its scalable Times and Helvetica fonts
respectively. If you do not want ATM to make this substitution, delete
the following two lines from the [Aliases] section of your ATM.INI
file:
<P>
<PRE>   Roman=Times
   Modern=Helvetica

</PRE><h3>PostScript Printer Font Downloading</h3>
 
<P>
The Add Font option in the ATM Control Panel adds the selected fonts
to every PostScript printer in WIN.INI as manually downloaded fonts.
This configuration minimizes printing time because fonts are not
downloaded by Windows every time there is a font change in your
document; however, the desired fonts must be resident in the printer
(either in memory or on the printer's hard disk) before printing. You
can reconfigure a manually downloaded font as an automatically
downloaded font by modifying its entry in the PostScript section of
WIN.INI. See the documentation provided with your font package for
more information.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing or Reinstalling a New Version of ATM</h3>
 
<P>
If you already have a version of ATM installed on your system, turn it
off using the ATM Control Panel, and restart Windows before running
the ATM Installer.
