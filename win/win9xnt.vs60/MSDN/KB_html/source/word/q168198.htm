<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<PRE>                                  SUMMARY
                                  =======

</PRE>This document presents a systematic approach to eliminating exception error
messages in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows running under Microsoft Windows
95.
<P>
<PRE>                             MORE INFORMATION
                             ================

</PRE><h2>WHAT IS AN EXCEPTION ERROR?</h2>
 
<P>
An exception error signifies that something unexpected has happened within
the Windows environment, typically an improper memory access. For example,
an application or a Windows component might read or write to a memory
location that has not been allocated to it (memory that it does not "own"),
potentially overwriting and corrupting other program code in that area of
memory.
<P>
Fatal exception errors are typically of the form:
<P>
<PRE>   A fatal exception &lt;XY&gt; has occurred at xxxx:xxxxxxxx

</PRE>Fatal exception errors are codes returned by a program in the following
cases:

<UL><LI>Access to an illegal instruction has been encountered.

<LI>Invalid data or code has been accessed.

<LI>The privilege level of an operation is invalid.
<P>
</UL>When any of these occur, the processor returns an exception to the
operating system, which in turn is handled as a fatal exception error. In
many cases the exception is non-recoverable and the system must either be
restarted or shut down, depending on the severity of the error.
<P>
In the following example of a fatal exception error
<P>
<PRE>   A fatal exception &lt;XY&gt; has occurred at xxxx:xxxxxxxx

</PRE>the &lt;XY&gt; represents the actual processor exception from 00 to 0F. The
xxxx:xxxxxxxx represents the enhanced instruction pointer to the code
segment and the 8-bit address is the actual address where the exception
occurred.
<P>
When working with Microsoft Word 97, the most common error message you will
get if the program "crashes" is an "Invalid Page Fault" or an IPF. The
error message will be similar to:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut
   down. If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, you will receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   WINWORD caused an invalid page fault in module &lt;module name&gt; at
   &lt;address&gt;

</PRE>After clicking the OK button, the program is shut down.
<P>
For more in-depth information about exception errors, please see the
following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win95x/q150314.htm">Q150314</A></B>
   TITLE     : What Are Windows 95 Fatal Exception Errors

</PRE><h2>GETTING CLUES FROM THE ERROR MESSAGE</h2>
 
<P>
The first clue as to the cause of an IPF is in the IPF error message that
is displayed. The error message will be similar to:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut
   down. If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, you will receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   WINWORD caused an invalid page fault in module &lt;module name&gt; at
   &lt;address&gt;

</PRE>After clicking the OK button, the program is shut down.
<P>
Note the module name that is listed. If the module name is Winword.exe,
then you must continue searching for the cause. Sometimes, however, the
module name is a printer driver file, a video driver file, or some other
non-Word component. If you can gather clues about the component that is
causing the IPF, then you can target the specific cause of the problem.
<P>
If the module name is something that sounds familiar to you, such as a
printer driver or a video driver, see the "Troubleshooting IPFs That Occur
While Printing or Formatting the Document" section of this article and
use those troubleshooting steps.
<P>
If the module name does not sound familiar or if you are unsure of
which component it is a part of, you can query in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base on the module name and you may get more information on it. Once you
get to the Microsoft Knowledge Base Web page, use the following parameters
for your query:
<P>
<PRE>   Product: Any Product
   Type of Search: Search the article text
   Search Phrase: &lt;type in the module name from the IPF error message&gt;

</PRE>For more information about searching for information in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base, please see the following article:
<P>
<PRE>     ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../zmiscellaneous/q129725.htm">Q129725</A></B>
     TITLE     : Obtaining Knowledge Base Articles on the World Wide Web

</PRE>Sometimes, removing and reinstalling the file mentioned in the IPF corrects
the problem. If this does not correct the problem, or if you aren't sure
how to remove and reinstall the file, continue troubleshooting.
<P>
<P><h2>GETTING CLUES FROM WHEN THE ERROR OCCURS</h2>
 
<P>
Sometimes, noting when the error occurs can be very useful in determining
the cause of the problem. For example, if the error occurs when printing
the document, you should skip to the "Is the Printer Driver Damaged?"
section of this article and try those steps first. If the error occurs when
you start Word, then you should skip to the "Troubleshooting IPFs That
Occur During Startup" section of this article. Otherwise, continue
troubleshooting.
<P>
If, after trying those steps, the error is not resolved, continue
troubleshooting at the beginning of this article and work through the steps
systematically. The goal is to try to get clues as to the cause of the
problem and resolve it quickly, by trying the most likely solutions first.
<P>
<P><h2>DETERMINING THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM</h2>
 
<P>
A key part of troubleshooting IPFs is to determine how widespread the
problem is. The following questions must be answered in order to
effectively solve the problem:
<P>
<PRE>   Is the problem reproducible (can you make it happen whenever you want)
   or does it occur at random times?

   Does the problem only occur in Word, or does it occur in other
   applications as well?

   Are there specific, known issues about Word that describe your problem?

   Does the problem only happen with a particular document (or a collection
   of documents)?

   Does the problem only occur at a particular time, such as when starting
   Word or printing?

</PRE>The following sections of this article discuss each question and Give
information on resolving each type of problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Is the Problem Reproducible?</h3>
 
<P>
If you were told to sit down at the computer and make the error happen in
a reasonable amount of time, could you? The process of solving an IPF is to
try a solution and then attempt to make the IPF occur again. If the error
goes away, then you can assume you have solved the problem. If the error
still occurs, then you know you need to continue troubleshooting the
problem.
<P>
If the error is not easily reproducible, then the best you can do is to Try
each of the solutions one at a time. After you try one solution, go back To
Word and work with the program for a while until you feel comfortable that
the problem has been solved.
<P>
If the problem has not been solved, try another possible solution. Along
the way, keep track of the solutions you have tried and their results, so
you know which solutions have been tried and which have not. Remember, if
the IPF occurs when you do specific things in Word or the document, you may
get some clues about which solutions to try first.
<P>
<P><h3>Does the Problem Occur in Other Applications?</h3>
 
<P>
If the problem occurs in other applications besides Word, then most likely,
the problem is not with Word, but rather with Windows, a component of
Windows, or a piece of software that is running in the background. While
some of the troubleshooting tips and possible solutions in this article may
be of help, the focus of this article is to resolve IPFs that are specific
to Word. For more information about troubleshooting errors that are not
specific to Word, please see the "Windows 95 Support" section of this
article for other resources that may be of assistance.
If the problem is specific to Word, that is, if it does not occur in
Other applications, then this article is targeted to resolve the problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Are There Specific, Known Issues Causing This Problem?</h3>
 
<P>
There are some known issues with Word 97 that may cause IPFs under specific
circumstances. For more information on specific causes of IPFs in Microsoft
Word 97, query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   Word 97 IPF

</PRE>For information about finding articles in the Microsoft Knowledge, please
see the following article:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../zmiscellaneous/q129725.htm">Q129725</A></B>
   TITLE     : Obtaining Knowledge Base Articles on the World Wide Web

</PRE>If none of the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base describe your
problem, please continue troubleshooting your problem using the information
in this article.
<P>
<P><h3>Does the Problem Only Affect a Certain Document?</h3>
 
<P>
If the IPF is specific to a certain document, the document may be damaged.
To test this, try creating a brand new, empty document based on Normal.dot
and reproducing the error in the new document.
<P>
If the error also occurs in the new document, then you know the problem is
not related to a damaged document. Skip this section of the article and
move on to the next section to continue troubleshooting the problem.
<P>
If the error does not occur in a new document, the original document may be
damaged. The following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base discusses
procedures that may be used to correct a damaged document.
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../word/q87856.htm">Q87856</A></B>
   TITLE     : WD: Troubleshooting Damaged Documents in Word for Windows

</PRE>Summary Of Steps to Troubleshoot a Damaged Document:

<OL><P><LI> Save the document as RTF.

<P><LI> Copy/Paste everything but the last paragraph mark to a new document.

<P><LI> Copy pieces of the document to a new document until you isolate the
<P><PRE>    paragraph or object causing the problem.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Insert the Document as a File in a New Document.

<P><LI> Open the document in another application, such as Word 6.0 or 7.0
<P><PRE>    using the Word 97 import converter.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Open the document in another application to recover the text.
<P>
</OL>If the IPF occurs with several documents, but not a new document based on
Normal.dot, try to see if there is anything in common with the documents
that are generating the error. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   Is there a common (possibly damaged) template that the documents are
   all based on?

   Is there a common graphic in all of the documents? Examples could be
   business logos, signatures, clip art, and so on.

   It is possible the graphic could be damaged.

   Is there a common font in use that is not the default font in
   Normal.dot? It is possible the font could be damaged.

   Are there links in the documents? It is possible that the file that
   the documents are linked to is damaged.

</PRE></OL><h2>TROUBLESHOOTING IPFS THAT OCCUR DURING STARTUP</h2>
 
<P>
This section discusses methods to resolve IPFs that occur when you start
Word.
<P>
<P><h3>Start Word with the Defaults</h3>
 
<P>
During startup, two of the events that occur are the loading of the
registry Data key and the Normal.dot global template. If either of these
items is damaged, Word may fail to start. You can temporarily bypass
these items by starting Word with the /a switch. To do this, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI> On the Windows taskbar, click the Start button and click Run.

<P><LI> Click the Browse button.

<P><LI> Locate the directory where the Winword.exe file is located.
<P>
<P><PRE>    The default location is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Click the Winword.exe file and click Open.

<P><LI> Click in the Open box and press the END key on the keyboard to move
<P><PRE>    the insertion point AFTER the closing quotes surrounding the file
    name.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Type a space followed by "/a" (without the quotation marks) so that the
<P><PRE>    command line looks like this:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\WinWord.exe" /a
</PRE>
<P><LI> Click OK.
<P>
</OL>Word will start.
<P>
If Word starts correctly, you have found that the problem is with a damaged
Registry Data key or a Normal.dot global template. Follow the steps in the
following section of this article "Set Word Back to the Default Settings."
<P>
If Word fails to start correctly, continue to start Word with the /a
switch where indicated, skip the next section of this article and continue
troubleshooting.
<P>
<P><h3>Set Word Back to the Default Settings</h3>
 
<P>
Deleting the Data Key:
<P>
Note: Deleting the Data key will reset several options back to their
default settings, including the File menu MRU (most recently used) list,
and many settings in the Options dialog boxes.
<P>
To delete the Data key, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI> Quit all instances of Word, including WordMail.

<P><LI> On the Windows taskbar, click the Start button and click Run.

<P><LI> In the Open box, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks), and
<P><PRE>    click OK.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Locate the following key by double-clicking the appropriate
<P><PRE>    folders.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word\Data
</PRE>
<P><LI> With the Data folder on the left selected, press the DEL (Delete) key
<P><PRE>    on the keyboard to delete the registry.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Click Yes when asked to confirm the deletion.

<P><LI> Quit the registry editor and restart Word normally (without using the
<P><PRE>    /a switch).
</PRE><P>
</OL>If Word starts correctly, you have resolved the problem. The problem was a
damaged Data key. You may need to change a few settings to restore your
favorite options.
<P>
If Word fails to start correctly, you may have a damaged global template
(Normal.dot). Follow the steps in the following section of this article
entitled "Renaming the Normal.dot File."
<P>
Renaming the Normal.dot File:
<P>
Note: Renaming the Normal.dot template will reset several options back to
their default settings, including custom styles, custom toolbars, macros,
and AutoText entries. For this reason, it is strongly recommended that you
rename the Normal.dot file rather than deleting it.
<P>
Certain installations may yield more than one legitimate Normal.dot file.
These situations include multiple versions of Word running on the same
computer or several workstation installations on the same computer. In
these situations, pay special attention so that you rename the correct
copy of Normal.dot.
<P>
To rename the Normal.dot file, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI> Quit all instances of Word, including WordMail.

<P><LI> On the Windows taskbar, click the Start button, point to Find, and
<P><PRE>    click Files Or Folders.
</PRE>
<P><LI> In the Named box, type "Normal.dot" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI> Set the Look In box to your local hard disk drive (or to an alternate
<P><PRE>    user template location if you are running Word from a network server).
</PRE>
<P><LI> Click the Find Now button to search for the file.

<P><LI> For each occurrence of Normal.dot that appears in the Find dialog box,
<P><PRE>    right-click the file. Click Rename on the shortcut menu. Give the file
    a new name, such as Normal.bak or Normal.xxx.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Quit the find dialog and restart Word normally (without using the
<P><PRE>    /a switch).
</PRE><P>
</OL>If Word starts correctly, you have resolved the problem. The problem was a
damaged Normal.dot template. You may need to change a few settings to
restore your favorite options. If the Normal.dot file you renamed contained
customizations such as styles, macros, or AutoText entries that cannot be
easily recreated, you may be able to copy those customizations from the old
Normal.dot file to the new Normal.dot file using the organizer.
<P>
For more information about using the organizer, click the Office Assistant,
type "using the organizer," click Search, and then click "Use settings from
another document or template."
<P>
If Word fails to start correctly, continue troubleshooting using the steps
in the following section of this article.
<P>
<P><h3>Clear Out the Startup Group</h3>
 
<P>
Word has the ability to automatically load templates and WLLs (Word
libraries) at startup. These files give Word added functionality. If one of
these files is damaged, it could cause an IPF when you start Word. To
correct this problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI> Quit all instances of Word, including WordMail.

<P><LI> Using the Windows Explorer or My Computer, navigate to the Office
<P><PRE>    Startup folder. The default location for this is:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       ..\Program Files\Microsoft office\Office\Startup
</PRE>
<P><LI> Drag the contents of this folder to another location, such as your
<P><PRE>    desktop.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Start Word normally (without using the /a switch) and try to
<P><PRE>    reproduce the problem.
</PRE><P>
</OL>If Word starts correctly, you know that one of the files you took out of
the Startup folder is damaged. Add them back to the Startup folder one at a
time until you determine which file is damaged.
<P>
If Word fails to start correctly, continue troubleshooting using the steps
in the following section of this article.
<P>
<P><h3>Is the AutoCorrect List Damaged?</h3>
 
<P>
The AutoCorrect (ACL) file is used to correct commonly misspelled words as
they are being typed. A damaged ACL file will generate the following error
message when Word is started:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE></OL>If you click Details, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   WINWORD caused an invalid page fault in module MSO97.DLL at
   014f:306c59b9.

</PRE>To correct this problem, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

     TITLE     : OFF97: Errors Caused by Corrupted ACL Files

</PRE>If Word starts correctly, you have resolved the problem. The problem was a
damaged AutoCorrect (ACL) file.
<P>
If Word fails to start correctly, continue troubleshooting using the steps
in the following section of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>TROUBLESHOOTING IPFS THAT OCCUR WHILE PRINTING OR FORMATTING THE DOCUMENT</h2>
 
<P>
Another category of IPFs can occur while you are printing or formatting the
document. These actions trigger the use of several Windows components,
including the printer driver and video driver.
<P>
<P><h3>Is the Printer Driver Damaged?</h3>
 
<P>
Word frequently queries the printer driver for information it needs
When formatting and printing the document. A damaged printer driver could
cause an IPF.
<P>
Most non-postscript (PCL) printer drivers use a common core file called the
Unidrv.dll. This includes Microsoft Fax and Generic/Text Only. For this
reason, if you are using a PCL printer driver and wish to troubleshoot the
printer driver, it is necessary to install a non-PCL printer driver. Almost
all postscript printer drivers use a common core file called Pscript.drv.
For this reason if you are using a postscript printer driver and wish to
troubleshoot the printer driver, it is necessary to install a non-
postscript printer driver.
<P>
To correct this problem, install a different printer driver
by following these steps:

<OL><P><LI> Quit all instances of Word, including WordMail.

<P><LI> On the Windows taskbar, click the Start button, point to Settings,
<P><PRE>    and click Printers.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Use the appropriate method for your type of printer.
<P>
<P><PRE>    Method 1: PostScript Printer
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    If you are currently printing to a PostScript printer (such as a
    LaserJet IIISi Postscript), follow these steps:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    a. Double-click the Add Printer icon to run the Add Printer Wizard.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. Follow the instructions in the Wizard to install a local HP Laserjet

</PRE>
<P><LI> Right-click the printer icon and click Set As Default on the shortcut
<P><PRE>    menu.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Start Word normally (without using the /a switch) and try to
<P><PRE>    reproduce the problem.
</PRE><P>
</OL>If the problem is corrected, you have identified the problem. The problem
was a damaged printer driver. Follow the steps in the following section
entitled "Remove and Reinstall the Printer" to correct the problem.

<P>
<P><h3>Is It the Video Driver?</h3>
 
<P>
Word frequently queries the video driver for information it needs when
formatting and printing the document. A damaged video driver could cause an
IPF. To correct this problem, install a different video driver by following
these steps:

<OL><P><LI> Quit all instances of Word, including WordMail.

<P><LI> Right-click the desktop.

<P><LI> On the shortcut menu, click Properties.

If Word fails to start correctly, continue troubleshooting using the steps
in the section of this article entitled "Troubleshooting IPFS That Occur
While Working in the Document."
<P>
<P><h2>TROUBLESHOOTING IPFS THAT OCCUR WHILE WORKING IN THE DOCUMENT</h2>
 
<P>
Another category of IPFs can occur while you are working in document.
Events such as pressing the SPACEBAR while typing or pressing ENTER on the
keyboard trigger the use of several components, such as the custom
dictionary, AutoCorrect, AutoFormat, and the spelling and grammar checkers.
This section of this article addresses these possibilities.
<P>
<P><h3>Is the Custom Dictionary Damaged?</h3>
 
<P>
When you type a space or press the ENTER key on the keyboard, the
background spelling checker will attempt to check the word. If it does not
find the word you typed in the main dictionary, it will check the custom
dictionary. When you run a spell check and click Add to add a word to the
spelling dictionary, the word is actually added to the custom dictionary.
If the custom dictionary gets damaged for some reason, it can cause an IPF
when you start to check spelling. To correct this problem, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI> Quit all instances of Word, including WordMail.

<P><LI> On the Windows taskbar, click the Start button, point to Find, and
<P><PRE>    click Files Or Folders.
</PRE>
<P><LI> In the Named box, type "*.dic" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI> Set the Look In box to your local hard drive (or to an alternate user
<P><PRE>    location if you are running Word from a network server).
</PRE>
<P><LI> Click the Find Now button to search for the file.
<P>
<P><PRE>    The default name for the custom dictionary is Custom.dic and the
    default location is ..\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office, although
    the file could be called almost anything and it could be located
    anywhere.
</PRE>
<P><LI> For each occurrence of a .dic file that appears in the find window,
<P><PRE>    right-click the file. Click Rename on the shortcut menu. Give the file
    a new name, such as Custom.bak or Custom.xxx.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Close the Find dialog box and restart Word normally (without using the
<P><PRE>    /a switch) and try to reproduce the problem.
</PRE><P>
</OL>If the problem is corrected, you have identified the problem. The problem
was a damaged custom dictionary file. At this point you have created a new
custom dictionary file and it does not contain any of the words you have
added in the past. If you would like to add the words from the old custom
dictionary file, follow the steps in the "Adding Words Back to the Custom
Dictionary" section of this article.
<P>
If Word fails to work correctly, continue troubleshooting using the steps
in the "Is It The AutoCorrect (ACL) File?" section of this article.
<P>
<P><h3>Adding Words Back to the Custom Dictionary</h3>
 
<P>
To add words from an old custom dictionary (or any text file) to a current
(or new) custom dictionary, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI> Open the old dictionary file in Word. If you recently renamed the old
<P><PRE>    custom dictionary file using the steps outlined in this article, the
    file is most likely called Custom.bak or Custom.xxx.
</PRE>
<P><LI> If background spelling is turned on, you should see red wavy underlines
<P><PRE>    under each word. Right-click each word and click Add on the shortcut
    menu.
</PRE><P>
</OL>If background spelling is not turned on, then run the spelling checker by
pressing F7 on the keyboard.
Once all of the words have been added, you can close the file and delete
it.
<P>
<P><h3>Is It The AutoCorrect (ACL) File?</h3>
 
<P>
When you type a space or press the ENTER key on the keyboard, the
background AutoCorrect will attempt to correct the spelling or grammar of
a word or add special symbols in place of some characters. The AutoCorrect
list (ACL) stores a list of what words or characters to act upon, and what
to substitute for them. If this file is damaged, you can experience an IPF
when Word tries to access the ACL file. To correct this problem, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI> Quit all instances of Word, including WordMail.

<P><LI> On the Windows taskbar, click the Start button, point to Find, and
<P><PRE>    click Files or Folders.
</PRE>
<P><LI> In the Named box, type "*.acl" (without the quotation marks). In the
<P><PRE>    Look In box, type the path to the Windows folder (for example, type
    C:\Windows). Then, click Find Now.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    When the search is completed, a list of .acl files appears. These files
    are stored in the Windows folder.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    IMPORTANT: One of the .acl files is named Mso97.acl. Do not rename or
    delete this file unless you are instructed to do so by Microsoft
    Technical Support or unless you completely remove Microsoft Office 97
    from the computer.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Right-click one of the .acl files (for example, User.acl). Then, click
<P><PRE>    Rename on the shortcut menu.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Press END on the keyboard. Then, type ".old" (without the quotation
<P><PRE>    marks) and press ENTER.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    The file appears with ".old" appended to the end (for example,
    User.acl.old).
</PRE>
<P><LI> Except for Mso97.acl, repeat steps 3 and 4 for all .acl files in the
<P><PRE>    Windows folder.
</PRE>
<P><LI> Quit the find dialog and restart Word normally (without using the
<P><PRE>    /a switch)and try to reproduce the problem.
</PRE><P>
   If the problem is corrected, you have identified the problem. The
   problem was a damaged ACL file. For more information on damaged ACL
   files, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   If Word fails to work correctly, continue troubleshooting using the
   steps in the section of this article entitled "Is It the Spelling or
   Grammar Checker?"

</PRE></OL><h3>Is It the Spelling or Grammar Checker?</h3>
 
<P>
When you type a space or press the ENTER key on the keyboard, the
background spelling and grammar checker will check what you typed and flag
it as misspelled word (with a red wavy underline) or as a grammar error
(with a green wavy underline) if needed. If either the spelling checker or
the grammar checker is damaged, it may cause an IPF when you type. To test
to see if this is the problem, try reproducing the problem with the
background spelling and grammar turned off. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the document if possible.

<P><LI>Immediately, before doing anything else, click Options on the Tools
   menu.

<P><LI>Click the Spelling And grammar tab.

<P><LI>Click to clear (remove the check mark from) the "Check spelling as you
   type" and the "Check grammar as you type" check boxes.

<P><LI>Click the OK button and try to reproduce the problem.
<P>
</OL>If the problem is corrected, or if you could not run the above test, you
may have identified the problem as being damaged proofing tools. Follow the
steps in the section entitled "Reinstalling the Proofing Tools" to correct
the problem.
<P>
If Word fails to work correctly, continue troubleshooting using the steps
in the section of this article entitled "Other Possible Solutions."
<P>
<P><h3>Reinstalling the Proofing Tools</h3>
 
<P>
If the problem has been determined to be the proofing tools, removing and
reinstalling them may correct the problem. The goal here is to run Setup
once to remove the proofing tools, and then run it a second time to install
the proofing tools. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Quit all instances of Word, including WordMail.

<P><LI>On the Windows taskbar, click the Start button, point to Settings,
    and click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click Add/Remove programs.

<P><LI>Click the Office or stand-alone version of the program you have
    installed and click Add/Remove. For example, this may be Microsoft
    Word 97, Microsoft Office 97 Standard Edition, or Microsoft Office 97
    Professional Edition.

<P><LI>Once you start the Setup program, click Add/Remove.

<P><LI>Clear the Spelling Checker check box.
<P>
    In Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition, this is located by going
    to the Office Tools section and clicking Change Option.

<P><LI>Clear (remove the check mark from) the Grammar, Hyphenation,
    and Thesaurus check boxes.
<P>
    In Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition, locate the Microsoft Word
    component and click Change Option. Then go to the Proofing Tools
    component and click Change Option.

<P><LI>Click Continue to finish the setup program.
<P>
    The proofing tools will be removed.

<P><LI>Quit the Setup program when it has completed running.

<P><LI>Run Setup again by following steps 1 through 9. This time,
    select (add a check mark to) the options for the proofing tools.
    This will install them from your Word or Office CD or disks.

<P><LI>Restart Word normally (without using the /a switch) and try to

<P><h2>OTHER POSSIBLE CAUSES AND SOLUTIONS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Are the Fonts Damaged?</h3>
 
<P>
A damaged font can cause an IPF when working with Microsoft Word (or any
other Windows application).
<P>
If a document crashes while working in it, try to determine what fonts are
in the document and apply these fonts to a new document based on
Normal.dot. If the problem occurs in the new document, systematically
reduce the number of fonts in the new document until you are left with the
font causing the problem.
<P>
NOTE: Tahoma is the font that is used in the dialog boxes and menus in Word
and Office. If Word is crashing when you start it, one possible cause could
be a damaged Tahoma font. Follow the instructions below for removing and
reinstalling the Tahoma font.
<P>
Once you have determined (or suspect) a damaged font, follow these steps to
remove and reinstall the font.
<P>
Note: This procedure will remove the font from your system and will require
you to be able to reinstall the font from its original source.

<OL><P><LI>Quit all applications.

<P><LI>On the Windows taskbar, click the Start button, point to Settings, and
   click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click Fonts.

<P><LI>Drag the font (or fonts) you believe may be damaged to your desktop
   (or to some other location outside of the font folder).
<P>
   The font is now "removed" from your computer. Any document formatted
   with that font will actually have another font substituted.

<P><LI>Quit the font folder and restart Word normally (without using the /a
   switch)and try to reproduce the problem.
<P>
</OL>If the problem is corrected, you may have identified the problem as being a
damaged font. For information on reinstalling the font, please see the
section of this article entitled "Reinstalling Fonts."
<P>
If Word fails to work correctly, continue troubleshooting using the steps
in the section of this article entitled "Starting Word as Cleanly as
Possible."
<P>
<P><h3>Reinstalling Fonts</h3>
 
<P>
Fonts can be reinstalled in one of two ways. Depending on the source of the
font, one way may be better than another.
<P>
Method 1: Adding the Font File:

<OL><P><LI>Quit all applications.

<P><LI>On the Windows taskbar, click the Start button, point to Settings,
   and click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click Fonts.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Install New Font.

<P><LI>Locate the directory where the font file is located.
<P>
   This would normally be a floppy disk or CD.

<P><LI>Select the font and click OK to install the font.

</PRE></OL><h2>USING SAFE MODE to TROUBLESHOOT</h2>
 
<P>
By this point, the IPF is proving to be difficult to solve and a different
approach to troubleshooting may be needed. The rest of this article
discusses a troubleshooting method where you will be starting Windows in
Safe Mode and then starting Word with the /a switch. If this does not work,
the problem may be related to a bad installation of Word, Office, or
Windows. If this method works, you will be presented with a few more ideas
for solutions.
<P>
<P><h3>Starting Windows in Safe Mode</h3>
 
<P>
Safe Mode is a way to start Windows 95 so that Windows is started in the
simplest method possible. It bypasses many drivers and supporting files

"Set Word Back to the Default Settings" section earlier in this article.
<P>
If the problem does not occur, continue troubleshooting by following
The steps in the following section of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>REINSTALLING WORD OR OFFICE</h2>
 
<P>
By this stage, if the IPF is still occurring, it is likely that you may
have damaged Word or Office files. This section will guide you through a
process of removing and reinstalling Word or Office to achieve the cleanest
possible reinstallation.
<P>
The easiest method to correct a Word or Office installation is to run a
reinstallation. While this is very fast and frequently corrects the
problem, there are situations where it will not correct the problem and a
more complete removal and reinstallation may be necessary. To perform a
quick reinstallation of Word or Office, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Quit all applications, including WordMail.

<P><LI>On the Windows taskbar, click the Start button, point to Settings,
   and click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click Add/Remove programs.

<P><LI>Click the Office or stand-alone version of the program you have
   installed and click Add/Remove. For example, this may be Microsoft
   Word 97, Microsoft Office 97 Standard Edition, or Microsoft Office 97
   Professional Edition.

<P><LI>Once you enter the Setup program, click Reinstall.
<P>
</OL>The Setup program will check the installed files and replace or install any
files from an earlier version that are the wrong size or that seem damaged.
Once the Setup is complete, restart Word normally (without using the /a
switch)and try to reproduce the problem.
If the problem is corrected, you may have identified the problem as being a
damaged file. If Word fails to work correctly, continue troubleshooting
using the steps in the "Removing Word or Office" section of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>Removing Word or Office</h2>
 
<P>
This procedure will guide you through the steps to remove as much of Word
or Office as possible. After the removal, you will install Word or Office
again.
<P>
<P><h3>Back Up User Files</h3>
 
<P>
CAUTION: This procedure could result in data loss. Before performing the
steps in the remainder of this article, you should back up any user files
that may be important. This includes custom templates, any documents, and
Normal.dot.
<P>
<P><h3>Remove Word or Office</h3>
 
<P>
The second step to the removal process is to use the setup program to
remove as many files as possible. To use the setup to remove Word or
Office, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Quit all applications, including WordMail.

<P><LI>On the Windows taskbar, click the Start button and point to Settings
   and click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click Add/Remove programs.
