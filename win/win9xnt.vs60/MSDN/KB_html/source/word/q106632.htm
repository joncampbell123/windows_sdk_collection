The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When an embedded object is moved within a document by cutting and pasting,
by dragging and dropping, or by text changes preceding it, followed by a
full save of the document, the object may change in appearance and may no
longer be editable. Subsequent attempts to save the document may result in
the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Disk is full writing to drive x:

</PRE>where "x" is the drive you are trying to save to.
<P>
Related error message:
<P>
<PRE>   There are too many edits in this document.
   This operation will be incomplete. Save your work.

</PRE>NOTE: With Allow Fast Saves turned on, Word will do a full save
periodically based upon the complexity of the document or the number of
times it has been previously fast saved.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Word for Windows. This
problem was corrected in of Word versions 6.0a and later for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To reduce the chance of this problem occurring, turn on the Allow Fast
Saves option by choosing Options from the Tools menu, selecting the Save
tab, and selecting the Allow Fast Saves option.
<P>
If the problem does occur, use the following procedure to save your
document. The OLE object may be lost and may have to be re-created. Some
Word-6.0-specific formatting may not be retained in the Word 2.0 format.

<OL><P><LI>Save the file in Word 2.0 format.

<P><LI>Immediately after saving in Word 2.0 format, choose Save from the File
   menu.
<P>
   The Save Format dialog box will say that the file is a Word for Windows
   2.0 format file and ask if the file should be saved in Word, or Word for
   Windows 2.0.

<P><LI>Choose the Word button (to save in Word 6.0 format).
<P>
</OL>If any OLE objects appear as boxes in your Word document, you must delete
and re-create them.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To obtain Word 6.0c, call the Microsoft Order Desk at (800) 360-7561 and
request the 6.0c upgrade.
<P>

</PRE></OL>Closing and reopening the document preserves the object if no part of the
offending document has been copied or cut and pasted into a new document.
This is because if no Clipboard functions have taken place when you close
the document, Word deletes the temporary work copy of the document, and you
are left with the last successfully saved file. Clipboard functions cause
Word to incorporate the changes in the temporary file into the good copy of
the file. Thus, the damaged object is saved to the current copy of the
file.
<P>
Saving the damaged document to Rich Text Format (RTF) has the same effect
as a Clipboard function, and the object will be lost.
