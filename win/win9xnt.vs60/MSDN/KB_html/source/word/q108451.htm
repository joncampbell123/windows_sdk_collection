The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Word-wrapped text that you copy from Word for Windows may paste into
a text-based application, such as Windows Notepad or an electronic
mail (email) text editor, without carriage returns at the end of each
line. This causes the text to appear on a single long line in the
text editor.
<P>
By contrast, wrapped text copied from Word version 2.x for Windows
pastes into a text-based application with carriage returns at the end
of each line.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
By design, Word 6.0 does not include carriage returns at the end of word-
wrapped lines in order to comply with OLE (object linking and embedding)
version 2.0 specifications. Use the macro in the "Workaround" section
below, to add carriage returns to word-wrapped Word 6.0 text.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
When you copy text from Word and paste it into a text-based application
such as your email editor, you may want to maintain the word wrapping as it
appeared in Word. You can retain the word wrapping as it appears in Word
6.0 using the macro below, which does the following:

<OL><P><LI>Cuts the selection, with paragraph formatting intact, and places it on
   the Windows Clipboard (the macro later restores the selection to its
   original position).

<P><LI>Opens a new document into which it pastes the selection.

<P><LI>Saves the new document to the TEMP directory in Text Only With Line
   Breaks file format, then closes the file.

<P><LI>Reopens the Text Only file, which now contains a paragraph mark at the
   end of each line.

<P><LI>Selects and copies the entire document.

<P><LI>Saves the file again (this removes the pointers to the Windows
   Clipboard, which makes it possible to delete the file).

<P><LI>Closes and deletes the file.
<P>
