<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you remove bullets or numbering formatting from a paragraph, sometimes
Word for Windows does not remove the associated hanging-indent formatting.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
By design, Word does not remove hanging-indent formatting if the paragraph
is in the middle of a bulleted or numbered list. Instead, Word applies a
"Skip Numbering" property, which is described below.
<P>
Word does, however, remove the hanging indent if the paragraph is at the
beginning or end of a bulleted or numbered list. In this case, Word applies
a "Stop Numbering" property.
<P>
<P><h3>"Skip Numbering"</h3>
 
<P>
If you select a bulleted or numbered paragraph in the middle of a list and
remove the bullet or number, Word applies a Skip Numbering property to that
paragraph. With Skip Numbering, Word removes the bullet or number but
retains the hanging indent formatting that was applied when you created the
bulleted or numbered list. You can use this functionality to create
multiple-paragraph bulleted or numbered items that are automatically
indented correctly. (To remove a bullet or number, select the paragraph,
and then choose the Bullets or the Numbering button on the Formatting
toolbar.)
<P>
<P><h3>"Stop Numbering"</h3>
 
<P>
On the other hand, if you select a bulleted or numbered paragraph at the
beginning or end of a list and remove the bullet or number, Word applies a
Stop Numbering property to that paragraph. With Stop Numbering, Word
removes the hanging indent formatting in addition to the bullet or number.
In other words, Stop Numbering removes all the formatting that Word applied
when you added bullets or numbering formatting.
<P>
TIP: To easily see which Skip Numbering and Stop Numbering properties Word
has applied to a paragraph, choose the Help button on the Standard toolbar.
When the pointer becomes a question mark (?), click the paragraph. Word
lists Skip Numbering and Stop Numbering under Direct Paragraph Formatting.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use one of the following methods to remove the indent formatting as well as
the number or bullet from a paragraph in the middle of a list:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Right-click the paragraph that contains the numbering to be removed (use
   press CTRL and click the mouse if you are using Word for the Macintosh).

<P><LI>On the shortcut menu, click Skip Numbering.

<P><LI>on the Format menu, click Paragraph, and change the Left Indentation to
   -0.25" (negative .25 inches).
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Right-click the paragraph that contains the numbering to be removed (press
CTRL and click the mouse in Word for the Macintosh.) On the menu that
appears, click Stop Numbering.
<P>
Notice that for numbered lists, Word starts numbering the following
paragraph with "1." If you want continuous numbering, change the Start At
value to the correct number. (To display the Start At value, click the
right mouse button in the paragraph and, from the menu that appears, choose
Bullets And Numbering. Select the Numbered tab and then click the Modify
button.)
<P>
NOTE: You cannot remove the indent formatting by clearing the Indentation
settings in the Format Paragraph dialog box. This does not remove the Skip
Numbering property, which maintains the hanging indent spacing regardless
of indentation formatting you apply.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products 
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in 
Microsoft Word 97 for Windows and Word 98 Macintosh Edition
