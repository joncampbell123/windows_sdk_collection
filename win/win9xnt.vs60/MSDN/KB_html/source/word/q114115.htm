<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,
   2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
PackRat 5.0 installs several WordBasic macros from its "Program Integration
Library." These macros integrate the PackRat 5.0 application with Word
version 2.x for Windows.
<P>
To run PackRat 5.0 with Word 2.x, you must contact Polaris Software and
obtain the "Polaris PackRat 5.011 Patch Disk," which contains the up-to-
date PackRat Integration Library (PIL) version 3.0, dated 1/19/94.
<P>
For information about running PackRat 5.0 with Word 6.0, contact Polaris
Software.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Below is a description of each of the Word for Windows macros supplied with
PackRat 5.0, taken from the PackRat online Help file included on the
PackRat 5.0 Patch Disk.
<P>
<P><h3>Insert PackRat Merge Fields (Insert menu)</h3>
 
<P>
This macro works with the PackRat Print Merge macro to enable you to create
form letters or similar documents. The Insert PackRat Merge Fields macro
lets you place merge fields in your word processing document.
<P>
After inserting the desired merge fields into the document, you can use the
PackRat Print Merge macro to replace the merge fields with the selected
PackRat information.
<P>
The following instructions describe how to use the Merge Fields function in
PackRat:

<OL><P><LI>Open your mail merge main document in Word. Position the insertion point
   at the location where you want to insert a merge field (or fields).

<P><LI>From the Insert menu, choose PackRat Merge Fields.

<P><LI>Select the field you want to insert into the document and then choose
   OK.
<P>
</OL>Repeat steps 1 and 2 to add all desired fields to the document. Add fields
like you would add words. Use spaces and punctuation as usual.
<P>
<P><h3>PackRat Print Merge (File menu)</h3>
 
<P>
After you insert the merge fields in your document, the PackRat Print Merge
macro does the following:

<UL><LI>Searches your PackRat Phone Book for the records you want included in
   the merge.

<LI>For each record that meets the search criteria, PackRat inserts the
   specified field information into each merge field in the document and
   prints it.
<P>
</UL><h3>Using the Merge Function</h3>
 
<P>
With the merge document open in word processing application:

<OL><P><LI>Select the PackRat Print Merge macro. The Phone Book Search form
   displays.

<P><LI>Enter your search criteria and choose OK. The Select Records dialog box
   displays the search results.

<P><LI>Select those records you want included in the merge document and choose
   OK. The Print Merge dialog box displays.

<P><LI>Select the desired options from the Merge Results box and choose OK.

<P><LI>Confirm the printer settings and choose OK. The merge document is
   created/printed as specified.
<P>
</OL><h3>Insert PackRat Name (Insert Menu)</h3>
 
<P>
The Insert PackRat Name macro enables you to automatically insert a
person's name, address, and related information from their PackRat Phone
Book record into your word processing document. The fields that are
inserted into your document depend on the Data Template being used. A
default data template can be specified for the Phone Book form in the
PIL.INI file (in the [FindName Defaults] section). If no default is
specified, you will be prompted to select the data template you want to
use.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Insert PackRat Name</h3>
 
<P>
From your open word processing file:

<OL><P><LI>Place the insertion point at the location where you want to insert the
   fields.

<P><LI>Select the Insert PackRat Name command. The Phone Book search form
   displays.

<P><LI>Enter the search criteria for the name(s) you want to insert and choose
   OK. The Select Records dialog box displays the names found from the
   search.

<P><LI>Select the desired name(s) and choose OK. PackRat prints the name and
   associated information based on the data template used.
<P>
</OL><h3>Insert PackRat Text (Insert Menu)</h3>
 
<P>
The Insert PackRat Text macro enables you to place any of your PackRat
information into your word processing document using the available data
templates.
<P>
<P><h3>Using the Insert PackRat Text macro</h3>
 
<P>
From your open word processing file:

<OL><P><LI>Place the insertion point at the location where you want to insert the
   fields.

<P><LI>Select the Insert PackRat Text command. The Forms dialog box displays.

<P><LI>Select the form containing the information you want to add to your
   document. The appropriate Search form displays.
<P>
   Note: If a default template is associated with the form you selected,
   that template will be used and you will skip step 6 in this procedure.
   (Default templates are set in the PIL.INI file.)

<P><LI>Enter your search criteria and choose OK. The Select Records dialog box
   displays the search results.

<P><LI>Select the record(s) with the fields you want to insert (choose
   the Details button to view or update a record) and choose OK. The
   Templates dialog box displays.

<P><LI>Select the template to be used to transfer the desired information and
   choose OK. (Templates are preconfigured groups of fields.) Refer to:
   Data Templates.
<P>
</OL>The selected information is moved into your document as specified by the
data template.
<P>
<P><h3>Save and Log in PackRat (File Menu)</h3>
 
<P>
This macro saves your word processing document and automatically logs it
into PackRat's Document Manager. This enables you to locate your files and
documents using PackRat's powerful search capabilities.
<P>
<P><h3>Using the Save and Log macro (File Menu)</h3>
 
<P>
With the word processing or Microsoft Excel file you want to log open:

<OL><P><LI>Select the "Save and Log in PackRat" macro command. The Document form
   displays.

<P><LI>Complete the form by adding a Summary, Key words, and Notes to the form.
   This will help you remember the contents of the document and make
   searching for it easy.

<P><LI>Choose OK. The file is saved in the Document form and you return to your
   document.
<P>
</OL>Note: If you select the "Save and Log in PackRat" macro with a previously
logged document open, the Document form will open with that document's
record displayed. If you want to save the file under a different name or
path, use the "Save As and Log in PackRat" macro.
<P>
<P><h3>Save As and Log in PackRat (File Menu)</h3>
 
<P>
This macro works identically to the "Save and Log in PackRat" macro,
except that it gives you the option to save the file under a new name
and path. When you select this command, the Save As dialog box
displays so you can supply the new name and path. Other than that,
it is the same as the "Save and Log macro.
<P>
<P><h3>Find File in PackRat (File Menu)</h3>
 
<P>
This macro enables you to quickly locate and open files that you have
logged into PackRat using the Save (As) and Log in PackRat macros.
<P>
<P><h3>Using the Find File in PackRat Macro</h3>
 
<P>
From your Word Processor or Excel:

<OL><P><LI>Select the "Find File in PackRat" command. The Document search form
   displays.

<P><LI>Enter the search criteria for the document and choose OK. The Select
   Records dialog box displays.

<P><LI>Select the file you want to open and choose OK. The document opens.
<P>
</OL><h3>Fax Using PackRat (File Menu)</h3>
 
<P>
The Fax Using PackRat macro integrates with your fax software and allows
you to address a fax using the information in your PackRat Phone Book form.
You must have a fax-modem board on your system to use this function. To use
this macro properly, you must have your cover sheet stored in the directory
specified in the [FaxDoc Defaults] section of your PIL.INI file (in the
Windows program directory). For example:
<P>
<PRE>   sCoverFilePath=c:\winapps\faxdocs\cover.doc

</PRE></OL>Important: Your fax software must be loaded and minimized before using this
macro.
<P>
From your word processing application:

<OL><P><LI>Select the Fax Using PackRat command. The Phone Book Search form
   displays.

<P><LI>Enter the search criteria and choose OK. The Select Records dialog box
   displays. You can update and modify any of the listed records by
   highlighting it and clicking the Detail button. This brings up that
   record in its form.

<P><LI>Select the name(s) to be faxed and choose OK. If your fax cover sheet is
   not in the same place specified in the PIL.INI file, you will get an
   error dialog box.

<P><LI>When prompted, enter any text that you want to appear on the cover sheet
   of the fax and choose OK. The Macro executes and the modem dials the fax
   number.
<P>
</OL><h3>PackRat Financial Report (File Menu)</h3>

application that prints the Date, Summary, and Amount associated with
financial records. You can search by Summary and/or Date on a specific
account, or across all accounts.
