The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c

<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists which network privileges you need to perform
specific Word for Windows operations over a Novell network. The
article includes the following sections:

<UL><LI>Novell Privileges Required to Only Read Documents

<LI>Novell Privileges Required to Create or Modify Documents

<LI>Symptoms of Missing Novell Privileges

<LI>Why Novell Features File Scan as Well as Create Privileges
<P>
</UL>IMPORTANT: On a Novell network, you must have the File Scan rights
(formerly called File Search rights by Novell) to run Word for Windows.
This only affects Novell networks, and it is not documented in either
of the Word references listed below in the "References" section of this
article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following sections list specific Word operations and the Novell
privileges you must have to perform each operation.
<P>
<P><h3>Novell Privileges Required to Only Read Documents</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   READ, FILE SCAN

</PRE>Below is a list of directories where users need only Read and File Scan
privileges to run Word (they only need to be able to read from these
directories):

<UL><LI>Server location of Word program directory tree (Administrative
   installation)

<LI>Server location of shared Microsoft applications (MSAPPS) directory
   tree (Administrative installation)

<LI>Windows program directory, if running shared Windows

<LI>Any server directories where you store graphics or other source
   files for links that you do not want users to be able to modify in
   Word.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: In addition, you need to apply Read-Only and Shareable Flags to
all the files in these locations. Usually, the Novell network
administrator sets this sequence of privileges and attributes after
performing the server installation of Windows or an application.
<P>
<P><h3>Novell Privileges Required to Create or Modify Documents</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   READ, WRITE, FILE SCAN, CREATE, ERASE, MODIFY (all rights except
   PARENTAL and SUPERVISOR)

      Note: NetWare version 2.x also uses OPEN and uses DELETE and
      SEARCH instead of ERASE and SEARCH, respectively.

</PRE>The following is a list of directories where users need these
privileges to run Word:

<UL><LI>The workstation's Word program directory tree, if it is located on
   the server.

<LI>Temporary directory, if it is located on the server.

<LI>Any server directories where the user stores documents.

<LI>Any server directories where source files for links are located that
   the user needs to modify (for example, Microsoft Excel worksheets or
   charts).
<P>
</UL>NOTE: The files in these locations usually have no Flags assigned,
which means the user has complete access to them.
<P>
<P><h3>Symptoms of Missing Novell Privileges</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>File Scan          The user cannot see any files in the directory, so
                   the directory appears to be empty.

Erase              The user cannot delete files, which frequently
                   results in a large number of temporary (.TMP) files.

Modify             The user cannot rename files. When the user does not
                   have Modify privileges, Word cannot rename .TMP
                   files during a save operation. When Word saves, it
                   deletes the previously saved version of the document
                   and then renames the current .TMP file. Without
                   Modify rights, Word deletes the document and then
                   cannot rename the .TMP file, so an error occurs and
                   the document appears to be lost (you can copy the
                   .TMP file to a directory in which the user has
                   appropriate privileges and then rename it).

</PRE><h3>Why Novell Features File Scan as Well as Create Privileges</h3>
 
<P>
If you have Create privileges but not File Scan privileges, you can
create files or copy them to a directory, but you cannot view the
directory. This means that, under Novell, you can create a "drop
directory" where you can collect files (such as reports or logs) from
many users that cannot be read by those same users.
<P>
If you have Create privileges but not File Scan privileges in a
directory where you want to create Word documents, a large number of
.TMP files quickly accumulate.
