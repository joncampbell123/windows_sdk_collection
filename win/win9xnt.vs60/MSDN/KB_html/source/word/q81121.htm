The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,
   2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you do not have READ, WRITE, CREATE, MODIFY, and DELETE or ERASE
rights in the network directory where you are trying to save a file,
Microsoft Word for Windows returns the following error message on a Novell
network:
<P>
<PRE>   Word Cannot Save or Create File

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
READ, WRITE, CREATE, and DELETE (or ERASE, for earlier versions of
Novell) are the minimum rights required for saving a file the first
time. READ, WRITE, CREATE, MODIFY, and DELETE are necessary for saving
over a file previously saved to the network drive. You must have
MODIFY rights if you are trying to save over a previously saved file.
<P>
You can check your rights by going to MS-DOS Shell and typing RIGHTS
at the prompt. If you have the above rights, the response should
include the following:
<P>
<PRE>   [R WDM C]

</PRE>The above-mentioned error also occurs if you DO have the correct rights
in the appropriate directory, but one or more of the following
conditions exist:

<OL><P><LI>You do not have rights on the current directory (that is, the
   directory Word displays above the Directories box in the File Open
   dialog box). This error occurs when you open or save a file. You
   must change the current directory in the File Open or File Save As
   dialog box to a directory in which you have rights.

<P><LI>The directory is Search Mapped (for example X:\USERS\USER1).

<P><LI>You have gone to Shell and moved to the root of X: (for example, by
   typing "CD\").

<P><LI>You do not have READ, WRITE, and CREATE rights at X:\.

<P><LI>You try to save a file to X:TEST.DOC.
<P>
</OL>This error occurs because Novell Search Drives do not hold their
places if you move between directories on the same Search Drive. For
example, when you type "X:" after logging in, you are taken to
X:\USERS\USER1 because that is the Search Map that was set up with the
login script. However, if you move from the X:\USERS\USER1 to the X:\
directory, the Search Map changes to X:\.
<P>
In the above example, if you usually type "X:\TEST.DOC" in the File
Name box when you save the file, you now receive the "Cannot Open
Cannot Create File" error message because Novell is mapping X: to X:\
(where you do not have rights) instead of to X:\USERS\USER1.
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
Create a Map Root to the directory in which you usually store files.
This prevents Word from changing the current directory to a directory
where you do not have rights.
<P>
Note: In this case, Novell is behaving similar to MS-DOS. For example,
if you move from D:\WINDOWS to the C drive, you can copy a file with
the command COPY TEST.DOC D: and it is copied to the D:\WINDOWS
directory.
