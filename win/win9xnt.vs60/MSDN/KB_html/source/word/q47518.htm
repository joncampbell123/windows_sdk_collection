<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The OPEN statement is part of the Word for Windows Embedded BASIC (EB)
language. This command allows you to open a data file for reading,
modifying, or adding to the file.
<P>
Note that the OPEN statement does not open the file into the workspace, it
merely opens the file for manipulation by your macro.
<P>
The correct syntax for the OPEN statement is
<P>
<PRE>   OPEN [File] FOR [Mode] AS [#]FileNumber

</PRE>where [File] is the name of the file you will be accessing; [Mode] is
Output, Input, or Append; and [#]FileNumber associates a unique file
number with that file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Mode Statements</h3>
 
<P>
"Output" opens a file for data to be output to. If the file already exists,
the existing file is overwritten with no warning.
<P>
"Input" opens an existing data file so records can be read from it.
<P>
"Append" opens an existing data file (or creates a new one if a file
of that name doesn't exist) so new records can be added to the end of
the file.
<P>
<P><h3>File Number</h3>
 
<P>
The file number associates a unique file number with that file, as long as
that file is open. When the file is closed, the file number can then be
assigned to another file that is being opened.
<P>

</PRE><h3>Statement Example</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Sub MAIN
      OPEN "Datafile.txt" FOR Output AS #1
      Write #1, "Testing",123,"Testing"
      Close #1
   End Sub

</PRE>This macro will create or open a file called Datafile.txt and put in the
comma and quotation mark deliminated data into the file. The data can then
later be retrieved using the "Read" command.
