</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses functionality changes and issues with the Open
dialog box in Word for Windows 95 and Word 97 for Windows. (To expose
the Open dialog box, click Open on the File menu.)
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Multiple Files by the Same Name Appear in the Open Dialog Box</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>Symptoms:   When you do an Advanced Search and specify Search
            Subdirectories, the results may show several files with
            identical file names, but their locations are not
            indicated.

Cause:      The results are displayed in List view.

</PRE>Resolution: Instead of List view, use one of the following view
<PRE>            options:
            Details, Properties, or Preview.

</PRE><h3>Status Bar Displays 0 Files Found</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>Symptoms:   The status bar displays 0 Files Found.

Cause:      By design, Word displays the 0 Files Found message in the
            following situations:

            1. No matching files are found.

            2. A search is in progress.

            To determine whether a search is in progress, look at the
            buttons in the lower-right corner of the Open dialog box.
            While a search is in progress, the Find Now button changes
            to Stop. When the button appears as Find Now, the search is
            completed.
            Note: The Status Bar displays 0 Files Found until the
            search is completed.

</PRE><h3>The "Look In" List Displays Parent Directories, Not Subdirectories</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>Symptoms:   The Look In list in the Open dialog box contains the parent
            folder, desktop folders, local or network drives, and the
            root folder, but not the subfolders of the current folder.

Cause:      The Look In list displays the current folder and upper-
            level folder and drives by design.

</PRE>Workaround: To view the subfolders of the current folder, look at the
<PRE>            list box below the Look In list.

</PRE><h3>Word Hangs or Crashes During File Open</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>Symptoms:   Word hangs (stops responding) or crashes at the following
            times:

            Case 1. When you select a file in the Open dialog box,
            regardless of which view--List, Details, Properties,
            Preview--you are using.

            Case 2. When you click Open on the File menu.

Cause:      Word may hang or crash when you attempt to open a document
            for the following reasons:

            Case 1. The selected document is damaged or corrupt.

            Case 2. The first document in the selected subfolder is
            damaged or corrupt.

</PRE>Workaround: Case 1 and 2. Remove the corrupt document and use a backup
<PRE>            copy of your document.
