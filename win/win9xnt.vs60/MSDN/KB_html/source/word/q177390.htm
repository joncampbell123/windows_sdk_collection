<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When Microsoft Office 98 or Word 98 Macintosh Edition is installed on a
Macintosh that has earlier versions of Office or Word installed, the OLE
libraries previously installed are updated to the latest version.
<P>
This is by design, because only one version of OLE can exist on a computer
at any one time. This usually causes no problems with the functionality of
the earlier versions of the products because the later version of OLE has
the earlier functionality included in it.
<P>
It is possible that you may notice additional functionality in the earlier
version of the products, such as improved drag-and-drop capabilities. The
updated OLE libraries supply this functionality when the earlier product
has the capacity to use it.
<P>
However, in some cases, it is also possible that when OLE objects are
embedded in documents in the earlier version of the product and those
documents are subsequently used on a computer that only has the earlier
version of the product installed, you may not be able to edit those
objects.
