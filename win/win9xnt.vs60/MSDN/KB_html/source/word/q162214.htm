<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In order to open a Word 97 document in an earlier version of Word (6.x
and 7.x), you must use a converter. For more information about what
happens when you use the converter, see the "Contents of the Wrd97cnv.doc
Readme File" section of this article.
<P>
The most recent version of the converter (Wrd97cnv.exe) is available in the
ValuPack folder included with the Office 97 SR-1 Enterprise Update (the CD
version of SR-1).
<P>
The converter is also available for download from the Microsoft Software
Library:
<P>
<PRE> ~ <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/wrd97cnv.exe">Wrd97cnv.exe</A> <I>(size: 984958 bytes)</I> 

   This file includes a Setup program that installs either
   Msword8.cnv or Mswrd832.cnv on your computer (depending on the version
   of Windows you are running). The Setup program also installs the
   Wrd97cnv.doc Readme document.

   NOTE: Msword8.cnv is the converter for Word 6.0 for Windows.
   Mswrd832.cnv is the converter for Word 7.0 for Windows 95.

<P>
The Microsoft Word 97 converter converts documents from Microsoft Word 97
format to Word 95, and Word 6.x for Windows or Windows NT.
<P>
For Network Install of Word 97 converter:

<OL><P><LI>Type "source:\wrd97cnv.exe /A" (without quotation marks) and press
   ENTER, where "Source" is the directory containing Wrd97cnv.exe.
<P>
   NOTE: All the files are extracted into the source directory.

   server location.
