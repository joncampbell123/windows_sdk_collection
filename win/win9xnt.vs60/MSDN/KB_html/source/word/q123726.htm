The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Word 6.0 for the Power Macintosh fulfillment disks (or "Upgrade")
correctly include only 7 of the 16 disks needed for installation. By
design, only Disk 1 and Disks 11 through 16 are included. These disks are
intended to be used with your original Word 6.0 for the Macintosh disk set.
<P>
The purpose of this article is to avoid the confusion that may arise when
you receive this seemingly odd disk set.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following list shows which disks are supplied with each disk set:
<P>
<PRE>   Word Package                         Disks Included in Disk Set
   ------------                         --------------------------

   Word 6.0 for the Macintosh           Disks 1 through 10
   Word 6.0 for the Power Macintosh
      fulfillment disks ("Upgrade")     Disk 1, Disks 11 through 16
   Word 6.0 for the Macintosh
      and the Power Macintosh (also
      referred to as "Combined")        Disks 1 through 13

</PRE>The Upgrade disks are designed to be used with your existing Word 6.0 for
the Macintosh disks.
<P>
<P><h3>To Install the Upgrade</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Use Disk 1 from the Upgrade disk set.

<P><LI>Use Disks 2 through 10 from the original Word 6.0 for the Macintosh 10-
   disk set.

<P><LI>Use Disks 11 through 16 from the Upgrade disk set.
<P>
</OL>This procedure is completely outlined in a cover letter that is included in
the box. The following is an excerpt from that cover letter:
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: This is not the entire contents of the cover letter.

</PRE></OL> 
To update your Word workstation or server installation, you will need your
original Word 6.0 for the Macintosh disks (numbered Disk 1 through Disk
10) in addition to the Power Macintosh disks in this package (a new Disk 1
and Disks 11-16).
<P>
To install Word 6.0 for the Power Macintosh:

<OL><P><LI>Run Microsoft Word Setup from Install Disk 1 of the Power Macintosh
   disks, labeled "Install Disk 1."

<P><LI>Double click on the Microsoft Word Setup icon.

<P><LI>Run "Remove All" to remove previously installed components of Word.

<P><LI>When the previous components are removed, select the installation
   options you desire.

<P><LI>When prompted for disk 2, insert disk 2 from the Word 6.0 for the
   Macintosh disk set you originally purchased, labeled "Disk 2."

<P><LI>Continue inserting Macintosh disks from the original set until you are
   prompted for disk #11, and then insert disk 11 from the Power Macintosh
   disks, labeled "Power Macintosh Disk 11."

<P><LI>Disks 12 through 16 will also come from the Power Macintosh disk set.
   After disk 16, installation will be complete.
<P>
</OL>You will notice that the Power Macintosh disk set contains disks 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, and 16. The original Macintosh disk set ended at disk #10. This
is correct. The supplemental disks contain additional files needed only by
the Power Macintosh.
