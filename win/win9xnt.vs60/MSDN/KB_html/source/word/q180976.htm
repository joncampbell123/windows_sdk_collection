The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes various methods you can use to create a watermark in
Microsoft Word. A watermark, as defined in this article, is any text or
graphic that is printed to overlap existing text in a document, either in
the background or foreground. For example, a logo printed lightly behind a
letter or the word "Confidential" printed lightly on a contract might be
considered a watermark. Some of the most commonly used text type watermarks
are:

<UL><LI>Confidential
<LI>Paid
<LI>Draft
<P>
</UL>The three methods listed in this article will show how you can create a
watermark in Word using the following features:

<UL><LI>Drawing features
<LI>A text box
<LI>WordArt
<P>
</UL>With each of these methods, to print a watermark on every page of a
document, you will want to insert it into a header or footer. To print a
watermark on just one page of a document, place your insertion point in the
body of the document where you want it printed and then use one of the
methods below.
<P>
To view a watermark as it will appear on the printed page, click Page
Layout on the View menu or click Print Preview on the File menu.
<P>
To format graphic properties or attributes as used throughout this
document, see the "How to Format a Graphic's Properties" section of this
article.
<P>
If the watermark interferes with the legibility of the text on the page,
you can lighten the object you used to create the watermark. See the "How
to Lighten the Watermark Color" section of this article.
<P>
Use the following information to determine which method below would be the
best one that you can use for your watermark needs:

<UL><LI>Use "Method 1: Use the Drawing Features" if you are inserting a graphic
   or picture.

<LI>Use "Method 2: Use a Text Box" if you want to use text as your watermark
   with none or limited rotational ability.

<LI>Use "Method 3: Use WordArt" if you want to use text as your watermark
   and you want to be able to rotate that text at any angle of rotation.
   This is the only method that allows you full rotation of text.
<P>
</UL><h3>Method 1: Use the Drawing Features</h3>
 
<P>
This method is an example of placing the Watermark in the Header and Footer
area so that it prints on all pages. To print a watermark only on the
current page, start with step 3.

<OL><P><LI>On the View menu, click Header And Footer.

<P><LI>Click the Show/Hide Document Text button on the Header And Footer
   toolbar.
<P>
   The text and graphics will now be hidden from view.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, point to Picture, click Clip Art or From File, make
   sure the Float Over Text setting is selected, select your graphic, and
   then click Insert.

<P><LI>Click once to select the object, on the Format menu, click Picture or
   Object, and then click the Picture tab.

<P><LI>Under Image Control, Color, select Watermark.

<P><LI>If you want, change the Brightness and Contrast settings.

<P><LI>Click the Wrapping tab and under Wrapping Style, click None, and then
   click OK.

<P><LI>Position and size the watermark by dragging it to the desired location
   on the document.

<P><LI>If the graphic was placed into the Header or Footer, click Close on
   the Header And Footer toolbar. If the graphic was placed on a page of
   your document, to move the graphic and its contents behind the text in
   the document, follow these steps:
<P>
   a. Click once to select the graphic.
<P>
   b. Right-click the graphic. On the menu that appears, point to Order,
   and then select Send Behind Text.
<P>
   NOTE:  Once the object has been sent behind the text, to select that
   object at a future time, click the Select Objects button on the Drawing
   toolbar and then click in the area of the object.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Use a Text Box</h3>
 
<P>
To use a text box to create a watermark, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Position the insertion point on the page where you want the
   watermark to be placed. If you want the watermark to appear
   on every page in the document or that section, position the
   insertion point in the header by clicking Header and Footer
   on the View menu.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Text Box.

<P><LI>Click and drag the mouse pointer to specify the size of the
   text box needed for the text or graphic you'll be using.

<P><LI>Type the watermark text.

   Direction on the Format menu, and then select the option you want. This
   rotation method is limited to 3 rotational positions. To have complete
   rotation flexibility, you will need to use WordArt. For details of how
   to do this, see the "How to Create Rotated Watermark Text" section of
   this article.

<P>
   a. Select the text inside the Text Box.
<P>
   b. On the Format menu, click Font.
<P>
   c. Under size, change it to the appropriate size.
<P>
   d. Under Color, select Grey--25%.
<P>
   e. Click OK.

<P><LI>To move the text box, select the border and drag it to its new
   location. To resize the text box, select the border, and then drag
   one of the sizing handles. You can also move or resize the text box
   with specific measurements by choosing Drawing Object from the Format
   menu.

<P><LI>If the Text Box was placed into the Header or Footer, click Close on
   the Header and Footer toolbar. If the Text Box was placed on a page of
   your document, to move the text box and its contents behind the text in
   the document, do the following:
<P>
   a. Click to select the Text Box.
<P>
   b. Point to the text box border, right mouse click, and on the menu
<P><PRE>      that appears, point to Order, and then select Send Behind Text.

<OL><P><LI>If the Drawing toolbar is not on, turn it on by pointing to Toolbars
   on the View menu, and then select Drawing. The toolbar should appear
   at the bottom of your document.

<P><LI>On the Drawing Toolbar, click Insert WordArt.

<P><LI>Select a WordArt Style and then click OK.

<P><LI>In the "Enter Your Text Here" dialog box, type the watermark
   text and then click OK.

<P><LI>Position and size the WordArt object by sizing and dragging it to the
   desired location.

<P><LI>If the WordArt object was placed into the Header or Footer, click Close
   on the Header and Footer toolbar. If the WordArt object was placed on a
   page of your document, to move the WordArt object behind the text in
   the document, do the following:
<P>
   a. Click to select the WordArt object.
<P>
   b. Point to the WordArt object, right mouse click, and on the menu
<P><PRE>      that appears, point to Order, and then select Send Behind Text.

   object at a future time, click the Select Objects button on the Drawing
   toolbar and then click in the area of the object.
<P>
</OL><h3>How to Create Rotated Watermark Text</h3>
 
<P>
You must use a WordArt object to be able to rotate text at any angle. For
details of how to insert a WordArt object, see the "Method 3: Use WordArt"
section of this article.
<P>
Once the WordArt object is in your document, to rotate text at any angle,
do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Click once to select the WordArt object. You should now see the WordArt
   toolbar.

   button, click to rotate to your desired position.

<P><LI>Click back into your document when done. Your mouse pointer will return
   to normal.
<P>
</OL><h3>How to Lighten the Watermark Color</h3>
 
<P>
If the watermark interferes with the legibility of the text on the page,
use one of the following methods to lighten it:
<P>
Method 1: Text not in a WordArt or Drawing Object

</OL>NOTE: The result of this method may vary depending on what options were
chosen when the object was created.
<P>
Method 3: Imported graphics
<P>
You may not be able to edit the graphic, depending on where it was created.
In this case you will need to use a graphics program to alter the color of
the graphic.
<P>
Depending on the imported graphic, it may be lightened using the Picture
Editor by doing the following:

<OL><P><LI>Double-click the picture.

<P><LI>If possible, use the Drawing toolbar to change the attributes that you
   desire. If you are unable to change the attributes here, you will need
   to use another graphics program to make the changes.
