9. Q. Where is the toolbar in Microsoft Word Viewer 97?

   A. Microsoft Word Viewer 97 does not have a toolbar. Adding toolbar
      support to Word Viewer would have made the program significantly
      larger and would have slowed down the program boot time. In order to
      make Microsoft Word Viewer 97 as small and as fast as possible,
      toolbar support was removed.

10. Q. Why do I get a message about margins set outside the printable
       region when I print a document?

       margins was set smaller than what your current printer can print.
       For more information, please see the following article in the
       Microsoft Knowledge Base:

       ARTICLE ID: <B><A href="../word/q166055.htm">Q166055</A></B>

11. Q. How do I restore Microsoft Word as the default .doc application
       after I make Microsoft Word Viewer 97 the default .doc application?
