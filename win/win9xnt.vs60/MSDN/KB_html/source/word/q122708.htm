The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Word 6.0 does not support the drag and drop feature of Scrapbook in the
Macintosh Operating System software, version 7.5.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Scrapbook is a desk accessory that allows you to store images, sounds,
and text that are frequently accessed. This can be thought of as a
permanent clipboard. Items that are pasted in the Scrapbook can be copied
when needed. Most applications support items copied from the Scrapbook.
<P>
The Macintosh Operating System software, version 7.5, comes with a new
version of the Scrapbook written by Light Software Inc., of Cupertino, CA.
This new version supports drag and drop from applications into the
Scrapbook as well as from the Scrapbook into certain applications.
