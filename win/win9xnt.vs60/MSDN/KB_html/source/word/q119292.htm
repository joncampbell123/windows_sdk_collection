<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Word 6.0 for Windows NT is an adaptation of Word 6.0 for Windows. All of
the new features present in Word 6.0 for Windows NT were added specifically
to take advantage of the following features, which are unique to Windows
NT:

<UL><LI>32-bit architecture

<LI>Long filename support

<LI>Multithreaded printing

<LI>Registry support
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Word for Windows NT offers the following features over its 16-bit Word for
Windows counterpart:

<UL><LI>32-bit Architecture
<P>
   Word for Windows NT is written to the Win32 API specification and
   is, therefore, a full 32-bit application.

<LI>Long Filename Support
<P>
   Word for Windows NT supports up to 255 characters for document file
   names. All Word dialog boxes that involve filenames, such as File Open,
   are wider to accommodate longer filenames as well.

<LI>Multithreaded Printing
<P>
   The background printing feature in Word for Windows NT runs as a
   separate thread. This makes working on documents and background
   printing smoother.

<LI>Registry Support
<P>
   Word for Windows NT stores all of its settings in the Windows NT
   Registry. As a result, multiple configurations of Word can exist on the
   same computer for different users. Word will also support user profiles,
   which means a user can move from one machine to another and continue to
   use his or her same Word configuration.
