<P>
In Microsoft Word 97, you can use the WordPerfect 6.x converter to open
WordPerfect 6.x for Windows or MS-DOS documents. You cannot save a Word 97
document in WordPerfect 6.x format. However, you can save the Word 97
document in WordPerfect 5.x format and then open the WordPerfect 5.x
document in WordPerfect 6.x.
<P>
For additional information on the limitations of converting between Word 97
and WordPerfect 5.x, please see the following article in the Microsoft

                                          respectively. Word margins are
                                          measured from the paper's edge to
                                          body text. The conversion adjusts
                                          the margins to preserve page
                                          layout. If margins do not convert

                                          Drawing layer objects are visible
                                          only in page layout view, print

                                          wrap-around text, and are

                                          columns, or headers/footers are
                                          converted to boxes with wrap
                                          through in Word. In most cases,
                                          these boxes become drawing layer
                                          objects in Word. Graphic lines
                                          become solid lines. Text that is
                                          tight-wrapped around a graphic
                                          becomes square-wrapped

   Watermarks        Yes

   WordPerfect       Yes                  If the WordPerfect fonts
   characters                             containing the characters are
                                          available on the system, all the
                                          characters are converted. If one
                                          or more of these fonts are not
                                          available, some characters may
                                          not be converted.
