<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
QuickDraw GX had a great deal of advance press, which isn't surprising 
given that it was originally supposed to ship with the first release of 
System 7 three years ago. Apple promised it would improve the Chooser and 
Print Monitor, word processing companies swore it would easily enable 
landscape and portrait page orientations in the same document, font makers 
noted that GX-style fonts can offer much more than ever before, Adobe, 
Farallon, and other digital document software creators surely noticed the 
Portable Digital Document Maker feature, and we users tried to sort out the 
features from the babble and the hype. This multi- part article explains 
what to expect from QuickDraw GX and the basics of how to use it.
<P>
<PRE> QuickDraw GX comes with Apple's recently released System 7.5, but third-
</PRE>party developers can license it for a small fee and include it with their 
products (it comes on four high-density floppy disks). I acquired my copy 
through Peirce Software's Peirce Print Tools, a set of QuickDraw GX 
extensions that add assorted printing capabilities to the basic GX lineup. 
(You can find out more about GX extensions in Part II of this article, and 
I plan to review Peirce Print Tools in an upcoming TidBITS issue.)
<P>
**Hardware Headaches and Software Minimums** -- QuickDraw GX isn't for 
everyone and requires more RAM than many Macs have to spare. Here's the low 
down - to run QuickDraw GX, you need:
<P>
* System 7.1 or later
<P>
* 68020-based Macintosh or newer (including the Power Macs)
<P>
* Approximately 1.7 MB of RAM that you can dedicate to QuickDraw GX
<P>
* 400K RAM that you can dedicate to Adobe Type Manager GX (only if you use 
ATM GX)
<P>
* A GX printer driver for your printer. QuickDraw GX comes with drivers 
for: StyleWriters (no Color StyleWriter), ImageWriters, various 
LaserWriters (a few of the QuickDraw LaserWriters appear to be missing, but 
you may be able to substitute an existing driver for a missing one). Note 
that many (if not all) PostScript printers do work with the LaserWriter 
driver, but if you need to (or wish to) use a third-party driver, you must 
ask the third- party about the driver (in general, third-parties are 
releasing GX drivers).
<P>
<PRE> If your hardware can handle GX and you like to play around with funky 
</PRE>printing projects, GX offers you hours of amusement. If you work in an 
environment where a bank of printers hang out near every water fountain and 
you can never remember whose office has the color DeskWriter this month, 
then you need GX to help you avoid extra trips to the Chooser. If you work 
in a corporate environment where the Help Desk staff is more NT-oriented 
than Mac-savvy and (as a result) you know the location of every Mac printer 
within a twenty minute walk, GX will save you more trips to the Chooser 
than you can make in a month of Sundays.
<P>
**What Supports QuickDraw GX?** -- Remember System 7-savvy? Depending on 
who you asked, System 7-savvy meant different things, although after a 
while people came to agree that you might expect a System 7-savvy 
application to support virtual memory, Publish &amp; Subscribe, offer at least 
a few Apple events, and so on. Similarly, GX-savvy means different things 
to different people, but on a basic level, a GX-savvy application must 
support the "GX printing architecture" by recognizing GX printer drivers 
and offering GX-style Print and Page Setup dialog boxes. On a more 
sophisticated level, a program might support GX fonts by recognizing their 
extended character set (up to 65,000 characters per font) and by handling 
their "line layout capabilities" (Part II of this article will have more on 
GX fonts.)
<P>
<PRE> To find out to what extent a program supports QuickDraw GX, you'd have to 
</PRE>ask the company that makes the program, though it's a reasonable assumption 
that software released before this summer does not support GX. In much the 
same way that native Power Mac programs have dribbled out over the past 
seven months, I expect that GX-savvy software will slowly arrive, though I 
expect more programs will support the printing architecture than the fonts.
<P>
<PRE> Of the new crop of word processors coming out this fall, only WordPerfect 
</PRE>3.1 and Word 6 can claim GX support (WordPerfect 3.0 also has GX support.) 
These three programs support the GX printing architecture, but none support 
the fonts. The soon-to-be released FullWrite 2.0 and NisusWriter 4.0 will 
not support GX, though both companies plan to add GX support in future 
releases. Adobe (the name "Aldus" has disappeared into the dust stirred up 
by the Adobe-Aldus merger) is still hedging over GX support for PageMaker, 
and Quark has said QuarkXPress won't support GX, though they also said they 
wouldn't ship a PowerPC native versions and later changed their minds.
<P>
<PRE> Of the three programs currently planned to ship with full GX support, the 
</PRE>one I'll be keeping an eye out for is Manhattan Graphics's Ready,Set,Go! GX 
version 7, but it will also be interesting to check out the full GX support 
in the more specialized Typestry 2 (from Pixar) and FontChameleon (from 
Ares Software Corporation). The folks working on Ready,Set,Go! GX hope to 
ship version 7 by the end of 1994 - I know I'll be checking out their booth 
at January Macworld Expo.
<P>
**Desktop Printer Icon** -- Installing GX works much like installing any 
other program, but once you install it, you cannot print until you set up a 
desktop printer (tech support people, pay attention here!). If you don't 
set up a desktop printer, attempts to print result in error messages, such 
as "Select Chooser from the Apple menu to create a desktop printer."
<P>
<PRE> To create a desktop printer, open the Chooser, select a driver icon, 
</PRE>select a specific port or printer, and then click the Create button. The 
desktop printer icon sits on the desktop, and you cannot place it 
elsewhere, though you can place an alias elsewhere. If you select a desktop 
printer icon, a Printing menu appears right of the Special menu. Once you 
create a desktop printer icon, you can print using traditional techniques 
or by dragging a document icon to a desktop printer icon.
<P>
<PRE> Desktop printers add new printing features and replace Print Monitor, 
</PRE>affectionately known to those of us who hate it as Print Monster. To see 
documents queued to a printer, double-click the corresponding desktop 
printer. The new printing features enable you to put a print job on hold, 
see a "print preview" of any queued job (just double-click the job), remove 
a print job, start printing again on any page, drag a print job to the 
Finder for storage, drag a job to a different desktop printer so it can 
print to the corresponding real life printer, and more.
<P>
<PRE> Using a desktop printer, you can "share" a real printer, much as you would 
</PRE>share a hard disk (select the icon and choose Sharing from the File menu). 
You can also password protect printers, though this works best on networks 
where everyone runs GX.
<P>
If you set up more than one desktop printer, one printer becomes the 
default in the Page Setup and Print dialog boxes. The default printer has a 
heavy outline, and you can make any printer the default by selecting its 
icon and choosing Set Default Printer from the Printing menu.
<P>
If you only have one or two printers, the desktop printer interface works 
well, but if you have access to many printers, you won't want a million 
printer icons cluttering your desktop. Since you can't store the icons 
anywhere else, I expect a number of utilities will show up to assist people 
in managing desktop printers. One possible (but inelegant) strategy for 
coping with too many desktop printers is to pile the icons one on top of 
the other in a corner somewhere and then organize the aliases neatly in the 
Apple menu.
<P>
**New Page Setup and Print Dialog Boxes** -- The basic Page Setup dialog 
box offers a More Choices button and four basic options - orientation, 
scale (formerly called reduction), desktop printer (or any installed 
driver, and paper size (including any custom size that you set up in the 
PaperType Editor - more on that in Part II).
<P>
If you click the More Choices button, the button turns into a Fewer Choices 
button and the dialog box offers an interface reminiscent of the System 6 
Control Panel. You might see additional page setup choices, either from the 
active program or from a GX extension.
<P>
A number of familiar Page Setup options have retired, and I say good 
riddance to Larger Print Area, Font Substitution, and Unlimited 
Downloadable Fonts (GX fonts download much more efficiently to the printer, 
so there should never be a problem with the printer not having enough RAM 
to accommodate them).
<P>
The new Print dialog box also has a System 6 Control Panel interface. 
"Fewer Choices" mode is straightforward, and should take care of the 
options that most people want most of the time. But after you click the 
More Choices button, you can set a wide array of options, which can come 
from the current application or from a GX extension. Perhaps the most 
intriguing option controls how a large image prints if it doesn't fit on 
one page - you can crop the bottom and right so the image fits on one page, 
tile the image so it prints on more than one page, or scale it to fit. 
Other interesting features include setting the print time for a document 
and indicating that a document is urgent and should print before other 
queued documents.
<P>
Before I began playing with QuickDraw GX, I figured it would take me a half 
hour or so to write up an article for TidBITS; instead, after many hours, 
I'm still learning more and I've written enough information to fill an 
entire issue. So, instead of running one monster-sized article, I'm 
breaking this article into one (or more) additional articles. Tune in next 
week for a look at QuickDraw GX fonts - the coolest part of QuickDraw GX - 
and for a peek at the various utilities that come with QuickDraw GX (a 
digital document maker, a utility for turning GX off, a new LaserWriter 
Utility, and so on).
<P>
If you have experience with QuickDraw GX and have run into a quirk, snafu, 
or problem, I'd like to hear from you. Or, if you bravely installed the 
beta on seventy Macs printing to ten different printers and miraculously 
had no problems (or none you couldn't solve easily), I'd like to know about 
that as well. Be warned, I probably won't offer any solutions, but I'd like 
to get a better feel for GX's overall stability.
