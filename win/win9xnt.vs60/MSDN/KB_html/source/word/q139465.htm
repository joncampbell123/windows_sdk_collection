The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform a mail merge to fax, one of the following problems occur:

<UL><LI>The computer appears to hang and there is no output
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The following error messages appears:
<P>
<P><PRE>     Microsoft Word Error=1177
     The document name or path is not valid:
     (C:\WINDOWS\SPOOL\FAX\...\FILENAME)
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
One of the choices during the fax process is to send the fax "As
Attachment." This option is designed to allow the document being merged to
retain its formatting (font, size, graphics, and so forth). When using this
option, the fax-rendering system will "time-out" after the second record.
When the time-out occurs, the fax system deletes the document that Word
expects to find and use during the merge process. The result is that the
merge process is unsuccessful.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Word for Windows 95,
version 7.0. This was fixed in Word for Windows 95, version 7.0a (See
<B><A href="../word/q145523.htm">Q145523</A></B> for List of Fixed Bugs in Word 7.0a for Windows 95)
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Method 1: Do not use the Send As Attachment option. By not selecting this
<PRE>          option, the records will merge with plain text formatting, but
          all records will fax successfully.

</PRE>Method 2: Use the As Attachment option, but merge the records two at a
<PRE>          time. For example, merge records 1 and 2, then 3 and 4, and so
          on.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Depending on the configuration of the modem being used, the complexity of
the main document, and possible other factors, additional symptoms may be
seen in the merge process. Symptoms that have been reported include:

<UL><LI>Clicking OK at the error screen and the fax finishing successfully.

<LI>Faxes collecting in the Exchange Outbox for a long period of time (30
   minutes) and then being reported as undeliverable by Exchange.

<LI>Faxes immediately being reported as undeliverable.

<LI>The Exchange dialog box for "Preparing Fax Format" being displayed for a
   long time.

<LI>The Confirm Conversions dialog box being displayed as the spool file is
   opened.
