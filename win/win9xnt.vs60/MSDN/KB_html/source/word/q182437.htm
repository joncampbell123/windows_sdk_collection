   d. In the Save List As dialog box, do the following:
<P>
<PRE>         (1) Change the Save in box to the folder you want to save your
            updated address list.

         (2) Change the Save as type box to the following selection:

             Text File (*.txt, *.csv, *.tab, *.asc)

         (3) In the File name box, type a new name for your updated address
            list and then click Save.

            For example, in the File name box type "Address.txt" (without
            the quotation marks).

         (4) When Direct Mail Manager prompts you with "Would you like to
            create a form letter?", click Cancel to exit Direct Mail
            Manager.
