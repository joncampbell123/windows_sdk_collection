          ================================================

</PRE>This document contains information that supplements the Word Assistant
online documentation. If you open this document in Notepad, the text

</OL><h2>Tips and Known Problems for Word Assistant Components</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Templates: Tips</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If you customize the look of a Word Assistant template by changing
   the point size of a predefined style, adjust line spacing to match
   the new point size or select "single" to let Word set line spacing
   automatically. If you don't adjust line spacing, both the
   insertion point and the affected text will look clipped (if you
   increased point size) or widely spaced (if you decreased point
   size).

<LI>When you insert a clip-art image in a Word Assistant template,
   apply the "Picture" style to it, or choose the Paragraph command
   from the Format menu to set the picture's line spacing to "single."
   Either approach will make the image display correctly.
<P>
</UL><h3>Forms: Known Problems</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Changing the International Windows settings in Control Panel does
   not automatically change the settings in Word forms. You must
   unprotect the form, change the format of the field, then reprotect
   the form.

<LI>Tabbing through a field that contains a negative number disrupts the
   formatting. As a result, Word won't recognize the field as a valid
   numeric entry and won't add the number into totals. To correct this,
   you will have to manually adjust the formatting of the field.
<P>
</UL><h3>Font Selector: Tips</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Font Selector builds its database file, FONTTOOL.DBF, when you
   install Word Assistant. If the file becomes corrupted or is
   accidentally deleted, follow these steps to rebuild it: 1) exit
   Word, 2) delete FONTTOOL.DBF from your Windows directory, and
   3) restart Word. The next time you start Font Selector, it will
   automatically rebuild its database.

<LI>You can customize Font Selector by changing its initialization
   file, FONTSEL.INI:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - To put the Font Selector button on the Standard toolbar, add
      the following lines after the [Settings] section:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         [Misc]
         Button=1

      After making this adjustment, exit Word and restart it to
      see the changes take effect.

    - You also can customize the point size of fonts displayed in
      the As Font and Normal views by changing these values in the
      [Settings] section:

       - To set the size of fonts displayed in As Font view, type
         "AsFontSize=18". (Note: some video drivers limit AsFontSize
         to 16 points.)

       - To set the size of fonts displayed in Normal view, type
         "NormalSize=10".

      In these examples, substitute the point sizes you want for
      "18" and "10." For these settings to take effect, you must
      exit Word,delete FONTTOOL.DBF, then restart Word.

</PRE><LI>If you want to assign Font Selector to a toolbar button, menu,
   or shortcut key, create a macro that looks like the following:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub MAIN
      FontSelector
      End Sub

   Then assign the macro to the button, menu, or key using the
   procedures in the Word Help topic, "Customizing and Optimizing
   Word."

</PRE><LI>If you are running Adobe Type Manager(r) (ATM), you can stop Font
   Selector from rebuilding its database every time you start it.
   Just remove all ATM fonts whose names match exactly the names of
   TrueType fonts installed on your system.
<P>
</UL>Font Selector: Known Problems
 

<UL><LI>If you change button sizes in Word, the changes won't take effect
   until you exit, and then restart Font Selector.
<P>
</UL><h3>Special Paper: Tips</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If you want to assign Special Paper to a toolbar button, menu, or
   shortcut key, create a macro that looks like the following:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub MAIN
      SpecialPaper
      End Sub

   Then assign the macro to the button, menu, or key using the
   procedures in the Word Help topic, "Customizing and Optimizing
   Word."

</PRE><LI>If you insert a Special Paper design into a template, copy the
   FilePrint and FilePrintDefault macros from file SPECPPR.DOT to
   your template. To do this, choose the Macros command from the
   Tools menu, and then choose the Organizer button. For details
   on using the Organizer, see the Word Help topic, "Copying Styles
   from a Document or Template."
<P>
</UL><h3>Special Paper: Known Problems</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If you insert a Special Paper design before Word creates NORMAL.DOT
   (that is, the very first time you run Word), you will see this
   error: "C:\&lt;WinWord path&gt;\normal.dot does not exist," where
   &lt;WinWord path&gt; is the location of WINWORD.EXE. Special Paper's
   macros won't be copied to the Special Paper template and Special
   Paper won't work properly. To force Word to create NORMAL.DOT, exit
   and restart Word.

<LI>With some display drivers, Special Paper may cause Word to freeze
   after you insert a Special Paper design in page layout view with the
   zoom level set to 50% or greater. To prevent a freeze, modify the
   WINWORD6.INI file by setting BITMAPMEMORY=0 (for details on this
   setting, see the Special Paper online Help topic, "Drawing Special
   Paper Designs Faster").

<LI>Double-clicking the Special Paper design can affect functionality.
   You won't lose text, but Special Paper might not give you the
   option of printing a proof copy. To restore this option, choose
   Close Picture on the Picture toolbar, delete the design, and then
   reinsert it.

<LI>The file SPECPPR.DOT must reside in the SPCLPPR subdirectory of
   Word. If you move SPECPPR.DOT to a different directory, selecting
   a Special Paper design will give this error: "Word Error=1084."
<P>
</UL><h3>Setup: Tips</h3>
 

<UL><LI>You cannot launch any of Word Assistant's .WLL files from MS-DOS
   using Word's /l startup switch.
<P>
</UL><h3>Setup: Known Problems</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If you select the Custom/Complete option and specify a directory
   for Font Assistant, you may see this warning message: "Setup has
   detected an older version of Microsoft Word Assistant in the
   destination directory." Ignore this warning. The Setup program
   will install Font Assistant in the directory you specified.

<LI>If Setup incorrectly reports that Word version 6 is not installed,
   exit Setup, and then add the following statement to the [Microsoft
   Word] section of WINWORD6.INI: PROGRAMDIR=&lt;WinWord path&gt;. Here,
   &lt;WinWord path&gt; is the location of WINWORD.EXE. Then run the Setup
   program again.

<LI>If you've changed the Startup directory listed on the File Locations
   tab when you choose the Options command from the Tools menu (and in
   the STARTUP-PATH variable in WINWORD6.INI), Word Assistant will not
   install its .WLL files correctly. To resolve this, set Startup to
   &lt;WinWord path&gt;\STARTUP where &lt;WinWord path&gt; is the location of
   WINWORD.EXE. Next, run the Setup program again, and choose Remove
   All. Finally, run the Setup program one more time to install Word
   Assistant correctly.
<P>
</UL><h2>Tips for Users</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>If your system has many fonts</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If your system has many installed fonts, fonts may begin to
   appear in the Arial typeface. This substitution probably
   indicates a lack of Windows GDI resource. To eliminate the
   substitution, use Font Assistant to deactivate fonts you are
   not using or use Control Panel to remove unused fonts.
<P>
</UL><h3>If you're using the new Microsoft Mouse</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If you're using the new, ergonomic Microsoft Mouse, be sure to
   upgrade to version 9.01 of the Mouse software.
<P>
</UL><h2>Manually Decompressing the Files</h2>
 

<UL><LI>All files on the Word Assistant disks are compressed. The Setup
   program will decompress the files during installation. You can,
   however, decompress them manually using the DECOMP.EXE program
   that comes on Disk 1. DECOMP.EXE can decompress all Word Assistant
   files except those used only by the Setup program itself.
<P>
   To use DECOMP.EXE, insert Disk 1 into drive A (or B), and then
   copy DECOMP.EXE to c:\. Remove Disk 1, and then insert the disk
   containing the file you want to decompress. Next, at a DOS prompt,
   type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\DECOMP a:\filename.ex_ c:\dir_name\filename.ext
</PRE><P>
   Here filename.ex_ is the name of the file you want to
   decompress, and c:\dir_name\filename.ext is the full name of
   the decompressed file on your hard disk.
<P>
</UL><h2>Tips for Network Administrators</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Creating a Network Setup</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Create a directory (for example, WA10) from which to install Word
   Assistant. Within that directory, create a DISK1 directory and a
   DISK2 directory, and then copy the contents of Disk 1 and Disk 2
   into their respective directories. Tell the users to run the Setup
   program from the DISK1 directory. Every user must either have a
   legal copy of Word Assistant or must be covered by a site license
   for it.
<P>
</UL><h3>Installing to Windows on a Network</h3>
 

<UL><LI>When running the Word Assistant Setup program, set the Windows
   system directory to read/write so the Setup program installs
   the .TTF and .FIF files correctly. If the directory is set to
   read-only, the Setup program will fail.
<P>
</UL><h3>Installing to Word on a Network</h3>
 

<UL><LI>The Word Assistant Setup program will install all components
   properly except for the .WLL files: BANNER.WLL, FONTTOOL.WLL,
   SPCLPPR.WLL, and WASSTHLP.WLL. Users must manually copy the .WLL
   files to their local Word startup directories before starting
   Word Assistant.
