The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You receive the following Macro Virus warning message when you start Word:
<P>
<PRE>   The document you are opening contains macros or customizations. Some
   macros may contain viruses that could harm your computer.

   If you are sure this document is from a trusted source, click Enable
   Macros. If you are not sure and want to prevent any macros from
   running, click Disable Macros.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when you double-click any of the following:

<UL><LI>A shortcut pointing to an incorrect or missing document or a template
   that contains macros.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>A Word shortcut on the desktop that points to a document or template
   that contains macros.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>A shortcut on the Windows menu that points to a Word document or
   template that contains macros.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>A Word file on the Windows desktop that contains macros (and you use
   this shortcut to start Word).
<P>
   -or-

<LI>A Word shortcut that points to email.dot.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use the appropriate method for your
situation.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Change the Shortcut</h3>
 
<P>
Change the desktop or menu shortcut to point to the correct file or to a
file that does not contain macros.
<P>
NOTE: You may have had a previous Word shortcut that pointed to an
existing file, but you may have renamed, deleted, or moved the file
causing your shortcut to now be invalid. When this occurs, Windows tries
to find the file and it is possible that the shortcut will be directed to
an incorrect file. This can also occur when you upgrade from one version
of Word to another. Shortcuts you may have are not affected by the Word
Setup program. It is possible that your existing shortcut will become
invalid after you upgrade to a new version of Word.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Move the File and Correct the Shortcut</h3>
 
<P>
Move the file that contains macros to any of the template folders that
Word uses, and then correct your shortcut to point to the file in the new
location.
<P>
NOTE: Word trusts that a file placed in any of the template folders are
safe (free of macro viruses). Be certain that this is the case for all
files that you place in these locations.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 3: Create a New Desktop File</h3>
 
<P>
Create a new Word file on the Windows desktop that does not contain macros
to start Word.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This functionality is by design in Word when you have the Enable Macro
Virus Protection enabled (this setting is on by default). To enable Macro
Virus Protection (if it is disabled), use the following procedure:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click the General tab.

<P><LI>Under General Options, click to select the "Macro virus protection"
   check box, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>To Change a Desktop Shortcut</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the Windows Desktop, right-click the Word shortcut icon.

<P><LI>On the shortcut menu, click Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Shortcut tab.

<P><LI>Change the "Target" and "Start in" paths as appropriate, and then
   click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>To Change a Windows Menu Shortcut</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the Windows taskbar, click Start, point to Settings, and then click
   Taskbar.

<P><LI>Click the Start Menu Programs tab, and then click Advanced.
<P>
   This will take you to the Start Menu folder.

<P><LI>Switch to the location that the menu shortcut displays.
<P>
   For example for Microsoft Word 97, double-click Programs. On the right
   side of the window, you should see a shortcut to Microsoft Word.

<P><LI>Right-click the Microsoft Word shortcut, click Properties, and then
   click the Shortcut tab.

<P><LI>Change the "Target" and "Start in" paths, as appropriate, and then
   click OK.
