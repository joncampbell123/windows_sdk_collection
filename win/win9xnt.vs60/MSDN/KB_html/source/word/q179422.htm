The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Word 97, if you open a document from an earlier version of
Word or from another word processing program that uses the MS LineDraw
Font, you cannot use this font to draw lines or boxes.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The MS LineDraw font is included in earlier versions of Microsoft Word, MS-
DOS, and Microsoft Windows 3.0, and is not intended as a drawing tool.
<P>
This font is intended for importing documents that contain line drawings
from MS-DOS based programs, such as WordPerfect. Word 97 identifies the MS
LineDraw font as a symbol font, and interprets text in the MS LineDraw font
as a series of symbols. Therefore, many formatting and proofing features of
Word ignore this text.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To draw lines or boxes within Word, use the drawing tools and features that
ship with Word to create lines, outlines, boxes and other shapes. To do
this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Turn on the Drawing toolbar by pointing to Toolbars on the View menu,
   and clicking Drawing.

<P><LI>Use the Drawing toolbar buttons to draw the shapes you want.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Courier New font contains the exact same character set as MS LineDraw.
Word 97 should map the MS LineDraw font to Courier New; however, because
there are several versions of the Courier New font, Word may or may not map
it correctly. The Courier New version 2.0 font should allow the correct
mapping of the MS LineDraw font.
<P>
To access the line drawing characters that used to be available in MS
LineDraw, click Symbol on the Insert menu, and then click (Normal Text) in
the Font list.
<P>
For additional information about the MS LineDraw font, please see the
