The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,
   2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c
<LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0 and 3.1

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When more than 15 printers are added through the Control Panel, some
printers are not listed in the Printer Setup dialog box in Microsoft
Word for Windows. Windows can't have more than 16 printers installed
at any one time, and Word for Windows can't display more than 15
printers at any one time. However, it is possible to rearrange the
order in which the printers are listed, so a select 15 of the 16 will
be listed as available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For Word for Windows to recognize a certain group of printers, edit
the WIN.INI file. This behavior occurs because when these printers are
installed, they are listed in the WIN.INI in their order of
installation. The most recently installed printer is added to the
bottom of the list and consequently will not show if it is past number
15 in order.
<P>
To rearrange the order in which the printers are listed, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Edit the [Devices] section of the WIN.INI using a text editor such
   as Windows Notepad. The line(s) in regard to the desired printer(s)
   must be cut and pasted above their current position. Put these
   lines ahead of the 15th printer, so the last printer you want to
   access is the 15th listed or less. Save the WIN.INI.

<P><LI>Close Windows. After returning to the system prompt, restart
   Windows and Word for Windows.

<P><LI>Word for Windows will now list the printers as they are shown in
   the WIN.INI. The new arrangement should show the 15 desired
   printers.

<P><LI>If the printer you expect to see is not listed within the first 15
   printers, you should rename WINWORD.INI to WINWORD.BAK. Before
   renaming WINWORD.INI, close Word for Windows. (For archiving
   purposes, it's best to rename rather than delete an *.INI file.)
   Word will be forced to create a new WINWORD.INI file and will read
   the updated information from the WIN.INI file when Word for Windows
   is restarted.

<P><LI>When you restart Word for Windows, you will be prompted for your
   name. After entering your name, open the File menu, choose Printer
   Setup, and select a printer from the new list.
