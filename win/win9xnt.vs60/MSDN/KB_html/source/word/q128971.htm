    to accommodate the envelope's width. On the back of the printer, move
    the paper selector lever to the envelope icon.

<P><LI>In the Print dialog box, select your settings (Print Quality, Color or
    Black &amp; White, and so forth). Choose the Print button.

    the paper guide and with the top of the envelope feeding into the
    printer first.

    The Data With The Document, select Merge To Printer and choose Merge.
<P>

    (Best, Normal, or Draft) and choose Print.
