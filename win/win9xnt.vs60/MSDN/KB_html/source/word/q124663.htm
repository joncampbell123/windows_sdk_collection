The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Printing in Word from a 63x-series Macintosh (both Quadras and Performas)
to a Color StyleWriter 2400 or Color StyleWriter 2200 printer may cause
Word to unexpectedly quit or the following error may occur:
<P>
<PRE>   Error in the "Color StyleWriter 2400". Please check the connections,
   then try printing again.

</PRE>This seems to be a problem only with this particular printer driver and
with this computer series.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is caused by a memory conflict between the driver and Word
that manifests itself as a crash on the 63x-series machines.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This problem has been confirmed to be a problem with the Color StyleWriter
driver (version 1.6 and 1.6.2) and has been reported to Apple.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Method 1:
<P>
This problem does not seem to occur if the printer is set to the 
Communications (Modem) port instead of the Printer port. To print to the 
Color StyleWriter printer through the communications port: 

<OL><P><LI>Remove the cable for the Color StyleWriter printer from the
   Printer port and plug it into the communications (modem) port.

<P><LI>In the Chooser, select the Color StyleWriter 2200 or 2400
   driver and set it to the Communications (Modem) port. Close
   the Chooser.

<P><LI>Start Word and print a document.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you have a modem attached to the computer and your communications 
software packages allow you to reconfigure the software so that it will use 
the printer port, attach the modem's cable to the printer port and 
reconfigure the communications software to use that port instead of the 
communication port. 
<P>
Method 2:
<P>
If the above method does not work, it may be necessary to change a setting 
in the Cache Switch control panel on your machine. In doing this, it will 
slow down the operation of the machine somewhat, but it should print 
correctly from Word. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>From the Apple menu, choose Control Panels.

<P><LI>Double-click the Cache Switch control panel.

<P><LI>Select the More Compatible check box.

<P><LI>Restart the machine and try printing again from Word.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The Cache Switch is not installed by default under System 7.1 or 7.5. 
If you want the Cache Switch installed you may need to add it with a custom 
System Install. 
<P>
Method 3:
<P>
A final alternative is to increase the memory allocated to the Print 
Monitor.

<OL><P><LI>Open the Extensions Folder in the System Folder and select the Print 
   Monitor extension. 

<P><LI>From the File menu choose Get Info.

<P><LI>In the Memory Requirements box increase the Minimum Size to 3000K. In 
   addition, increase the Preferred Size to 3000K.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Using the Stylewriter printer driver version 2.1.1 or later solves 
some but not all of these symptoms.
