The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Photo Editor 97
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0 for Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0 for Windows NT 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you double-click a graphic file, the graphic is opened in Internet
Explorer 4.0, instead of the graphic program you were previously using.
<P>
For example, when you double-click a graphic file, the graphic should open
in Photo Editor.
<P>
NOTE: This problem occurs after you install Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0
and affects the following graphic file types:

<UL><LI>Graphics interchange format (GIF) (*.gif)

<LI>Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) File Interchange Format (*.jpg)

<LI>Portable Network Graphics (*.png)

<LI>Photo CD Image (*.pcd)

<LI>PC Paintbrush (*.pcx)

<LI>Targa (*.tga)
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This functionality is by design. When you install Microsoft Internet
Explorer 4.0, the associations of some registered graphic file types are
changed to Internet Explorer (IEXPLORE).
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use any of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Rerun Office/Word Setup</h3>
 
<P>
You can re-register Word (and all Office programs, if you run Office Setup)
by running Setup with the /y switch using the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Word or Office CD into the CD drive.
<P>
   If you installed Word or Office from floppy disks insert the Setup Disk
   1 in the floppy disk drive of your computer.

<P><LI>Click the Start button, and then click Run.

<P><LI>In the Open box, type the following
<P>
<P><PRE>    &lt;drive&gt;:\Setup.exe /Y
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    where &lt;drive&gt; is the letter of the drive that contains the CD
    or Setup Disk 1.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Click Reinstall.
<P>
</OL>When the setup is complete, restart Windows. The file types of your
graphics should now be associated with Photo Editor, just as they were
before you installed Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0.
<P>
For additional information about setup switches, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../setup/q132374.htm">Q132374</A></B>
   TITLE     : How to Display Help on Running Setup Program with Switches

</PRE></OL><h3>Method 2: Manually Change the Graphic File Type Associations</h3>
 
<P>
You can re-associate each of the graphic file types to any graphics editor.
To re-associate your graphic files to Microsoft Photo Editor, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Right-click the Start button and then click Explore.

<P><LI>In Windows Explorer, on the View menu, click Folder Options (Options if
   you are using Windows NT).

<P><LI>Click the File Types tab.

<P><LI>Under Registered File Types, select the graphic file type you want to
   change, and then click Edit.

<P><LI>In the Edit File Type dialog box, under Actions, click Open,
   and then click the Edit button. In the "Editing action for type: &lt;file
   type&gt;" dialog box, in the "Application used to perform action" box, type
   the path (or use the Browse button) to the graphics program that you
   want to use to open this type of graphic file, followed by a "%1" (you
   must include the quotation marks), and then click OK.
<P>
   For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\PhotoEd\PhotoEd.exe
      "%1"
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The Use DDE check box is not selected.

<P><LI>In the Edit File Type dialog box, under Actions, click Print, and then
   click the Edit button. In the "Editing action for type: &lt;file type&gt;"
   dialog box, in the "Application used to perform action" box, type the
   path (or use the Browse button) to your graphics program you want to use
   to open this type of graphic file, followed by /p "%1" (you must include
   the quotation marks), and then click OK.
<P>
   For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\PhotoEd\PhotoEd.exe /p
      "%1"
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The Use DDE check box is not selected.

<P><LI>In the Edit File Type dialog box, under Actions, click Printto, and then
   click the Edit button. In the "Editing action for type: &lt;file type&gt;"
   dialog box, in the "Application used to perform action" box, type the
   path (or use the Browse button) to your graphic application you want to
   use to open this type of graphic file, followed by /pt "%1" "%2" "%3"
   "%4" (you must include the quotation marks), and then click OK.
<P>
   For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\PhotoEd\PhotoEd.exe
      /pt "%1" "%2" "%3" "%4"
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The Use DDE check box is not selected.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 4-7 for each graphic file type for which you want to change
   the association.

<P><LI>Click OK to close the Folder Options dialog box.
<P>
</OL>Now when you double-click your graphic files, the graphic will open in
Photo Editor.
