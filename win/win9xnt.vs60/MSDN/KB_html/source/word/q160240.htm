<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform a find and replace while the Office Assistant is running,
the balloon message that informs you of how many replacements were made
does not include an OK or Close button. The Cancel button in the Find And
Replace dialog box does not change to Close while the balloon message is
displayed.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem so that the Cancel button in the Find And
Replace dialog box changes to Close, use one of the following methods:
<P>
Method 1: Click the Find and Replace dialog box.
<P>
Method 2: Press any key.
<P>
Method 3: Click the balloon message.
<P>
The balloon message is closed and the focus is returned to the Find and
Replace dialog box, and the Cancel button changes to Close.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for
Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A balloon message is an interactive message which requires you to confirm
or cancel an action before you can close it. The balloon message that
appears after you complete a find and replace operation does not include an
OK or Close button. If you click the Office Assistant while the balloon
message is visible, the Office Assistant will prompt you for a help topic.
If you click in the document while the balloon message is visible, you will
get a system beep.
