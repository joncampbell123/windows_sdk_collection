The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Word 6.0 for Windows, if you open a Paradox database that was created in
a version of Paradox earlier or later than version 3.5, Word may prompt you
for a password, or an error message similar to one of the following may
appear:
<P>
<PRE>   File Access Denied
   ODBC error: [Microsoft][ODBC single tier driver][ODBC file library]
   File access denied SQL state:4200 return code SQL_Error.

   Can't open unkeyed Paradox Table.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) Paradox driver supplied with Word 6.0
supports Paradox version 3.5 only. You cannot insert a database file
created in Paradox versions 1.0, 3.0, 4.0, or 4.5 (as a mail merge data
source or through a DATABASE field) using ODBC or DDE.
<P>
NOTE: If you are trying to open a Paradox version 3.5 database via ODBC in
Word 6.0 for Windows and a "File Access Denied" error occurs, you have a
different problem, which was corrected in Word 6.0a. For additional
information about this issue, please see the following article(s) in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : "File Access Denied" Opening Paradox 3.5 Database Via ODBC

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
Method 1:
<P>
Save the Paradox database in a format supported by Word's converters or
ODBC drivers, such as dBASE, Microsoft Excel, or Paradox version 3.5.
<P>
For more information about using or configuring the Paradox ODBC driver,
consult the DRVPARDX.HLP file in your Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.
<P>
Method 2:
<P>
Intersolv (formerly Q+E Software), a third-party software vendor, has a
Paradox ODBC driver that supports Paradox versions 4.0 and 4.5 and as of
September 30, 1994, version 5.0. For inquiries or orders call Intersolv at
(800) 876-3101.
<P>
Method 3: Obtain the ODBC Drivers Pack 2.0
<P>

drivers pack is available for customers of Microsoft products for a fee of
$10.25 to cover the cost of materials and shipping. To obtain the ODBC
Drivers Pack 2.0, call the Microsoft Order Desk at (800) 360-7561. If you
