<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article answers the most frequently asked questions about e-mail
support in Word 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<PRE>1. Q. If I use MSN, AOL, CompuServe, or Prodigy, can I use Word as my
   e-mail editor?

   A. WordMail is very much a "front end" feature. It can be used with
      Outlook or the Windows Messaging client that comes with Windows 95
      and Windows NT 4.0. These clients require MAPI service drivers to
      work with a particular online service. Windows includes a driver for
      MSN and a CompuServe driver is available from CompuServe. At
      present, AOL and Prodigy aren't supported.


2. Q. Can I use templates to control the formatting and style of my
      WordMail messages?

   A. Yes. If you're using Outlook for e-mail, click Choose Template on
      the Compose menu and double-click the template you want to use.

      If you're using Exchange, click WordMail Options on the Compose
      menu and then double-click the desired template. You can make the
      template you chose your default template by clicking the "Set as
      default template" check box to select it.

3. Q. How do I customize the standard WordMail templates or create my own
      WordMail templates?

   A. The standard WordMail templates are located in the Office subfolder
      of the folder you installed Word or Office to, which is c:\Program
      Files\Microsoft Office by default. To customize one of the standard
      templates, do the following:

      a) In Word, click Open on the File menu.

      b) In the "Files of type" box, click Document Template (*.dot)

      c) Select the desired WordMail template from the Office folder.

         If you have Macro virus protection turned on, Word will display a
         warning message that informs you that there are macros in the
         template. Click the Enable Macros button.

      d) Make your modifications and save the template.

      You can create a custom WordMail template by opening one of the
      templates in the WordMail folder and saving a copy of it under a new
      file name. To do this, follow steps a-c above, click Save As on the
      file menu and type a new name for the template.

      If you are using Microsoft Exchange, you can add a custom template
      to the list of available templates as follows:

     a) On the Compose menu, click WordMail Options.

     b) Click the Add button.

     c) Locate the template and double-click it.

4. Q. When I installed Office 97 it changed my Exchange or Windows
      Messaging e-mail editor. How do I get back the editor I'm used to?

   A. If you did not install Outlook and you have Exchange or Windows
      Messaging on your computer, WordMail for Exchange will be installed.
      To turn off WordMail in Exchange, do the following:

      a) On the Compose menu, click WordMail Options.

      Note: If you do not see this menu item, you are using Outlook, not
      Exchange.

      b) Click the "Enable WordMail as Email Editor" check box to select
         it.

      c) Click Close

      If you did install Outlook with Office, Outlook will replace the
      functionality of Exchange or Windows Messaging, and Schedule+. You
      should double-click the Outlook shortcut on your desktop, instead of
      the Inbox icon. Opening a mail message from Exchange will cause
      Outlook to run, resulting in an Outlook WordMail message. If you
      want to continue using Exchange instead of Outlook, run Setup and
      remove Outlook, then re-install Exchange or Windows Messaging.

5. Q. Can I send and route documents to co-workers from within Microsoft
      Word if my organization is using Lotus cc:Mail?

   A. If you are using Lotus cc:Mail in your organization, you will be
      able to send documents to co-workers from within Word. To do this,
      point to Send To on the File menu and then click Mail Recipient.
