The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 5.1, 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Word for the Macintosh on a Macintosh PowerBook
computer, a battery-level indicator appears on the right end of the
Word ruler. This indicator displays how much charge remains in the
battery, not how much time remains before the battery is depleted. The
battery indicator is a new feature in Word version 5.1 and is provided as a
quick reference. The indicator may not accurately reflect the charge
condition of the battery.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The battery in a PowerBook does not lose power at a constant rate.
Therefore, a battery indicator showing that a battery has lost half
its charge does not necessarily mean that the time remaining before
the battery runs out is half over. The indicator appears black when
the battery is fully charged and white when the battery is almost
completely discharged.
<P>
To make the battery last longer, set up the PowerBook so the computer
infrequently accesses floppy and hard disks, turn off AppleTalk when
you don't need it, and keep the screen level as dim as is practical.
<P>
For more detailed information about the battery-level indicator, see
"What's New in Microsoft Word Version 5.1," page 55.
