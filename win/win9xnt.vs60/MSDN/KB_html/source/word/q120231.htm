The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Word 6.0 for the Macintosh optimized for the Power Macintosh takes longer
to start than the version that runs on other Macintosh computers when both
versions are run on a Power Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Code optimized for the PowerMac is much larger than code for other
Macintosh computers, so it takes longer to load into the computer's memory.
<P>
Startup speed of the native version (specifically designed for the
PowerMac) takes approximately 20 percent longer than versions running in
emulation mode. However, the native version provides better performance
once Word is running. The native version starts slower because the Word 
program file is larger (PPC specific code) and can't delay loading OLE, 
libraries, the Speller, and so forth.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Power Macintosh uses Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)
technology, and other Macintosh computers use Complex Instruction Set
Computer (CISC) technology. The difference between these two types is that
the microprocessor in the computer understands either a large or small set
of instructions. This difference doesn't limit either computer in the tasks
it can do; it only changes how the code is written to do the same thing.
<P>
For example, suppose a CISC doesn't understand any mathematical
instructions except "ADD." To do multiplication, you would have to do
addition several times. The benefit of using RISC is that if the computer
uses fewer instructions, it can complete all of the instructions much
faster because the computer takes less time to interpret the instructions.
Therefore, adding multiple times is actually faster than doing true
multiplication.
