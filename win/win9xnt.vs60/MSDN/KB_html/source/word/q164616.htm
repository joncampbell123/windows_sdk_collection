The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you type a hyperlink, you may receive one of the following problems
when you click it:
<P>
<PRE>   In Word
   --------

   You receive the following error message:

      Cannot open the specified file

   In Outlook with Word as Your E-mail Editor
   ------------------------------------------

   When you click the hyperlink, nothing happens.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If you type certain punctuation marks with the hyperlink, Word resolves
the punctuation marks as part of the hyperlink incorrectly.
<P>
The following punctuation marks are resolved incorrectly by Word:

<UL><LI>Colon
<LI>Semicolon
<LI>Closing Parenthsis
<LI>Exclaimation Point
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, type a space between the hyperlink and the
punctuation mark, or type the hyperlink on line that is separate from the
rest of the text and its punctuation.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can enrich Web pages and Word publications that others read online by
inserting hyperlinks to other items. The hyperlink can jump to a location
in the current document or Web page, to a different Word document or Web
page, or to a file that was created in a different program. You can even
use hyperlinks to jump to multimedia files, such as sounds and videos. The
destination the hyperlink jumps to can be on your hard disk, on your
company's intranet, or on the Internet, such as a page on the World Wide
Web. For example, you can create a hyperlink that jumps from a Word file
to a chart in Microsoft Excel. A hyperlink is represented by a "hot" image
or display text, which is often blue and underlined, that the reader
clicks to jump to a different location.
<P>
Use the automatic formatting features for Word documents and Web pages
when you know the addresses to jump to or when you have a document that
contains file names or addresses that you want to format as hyperlinks.
Use the Insert Hyperlink command to insert a hyperlink into Word files and
Web pages when you aren't using the automatic formatting features or when
you want to browse for the destination address. Use a drag-and-drop
operation in Word files when you want to use the mouse to quickly create a
hyperlink for text located within another Office file.
<P>
For more information about Hyperlinks, click the Office Assistant, type
"How Do I Insert a Hyperlink," click Search, and then click to view
"Create Hyperlinks."
<P>
NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Microsoft Help is not installed on your computer,
