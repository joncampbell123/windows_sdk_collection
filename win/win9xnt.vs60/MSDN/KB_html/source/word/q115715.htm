The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install Word for Windows on a server, all or some of the
workstations may not use the option or preference settings you selected
during Setup. Instead, these workstations may all use the same set of
defaults such as the default font or Most Recently Used (MRU) list on the
File menu.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if either of the following files exists in the network
server program directory (instead of in the user directory that you
specified during the Workstation Setup):

<UL><LI>Winword.opt
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Normal.dot
<P>
</UL>NOTE: The Winword.opt file applies only to Microsoft Word version 6.x.
Later versions of Word store option settings in the Windows registry.
<P>
Word (not Word Setup) creates the Winword.opt and the Normal.dot files in
the server program directory. This occurs if the network administrator (or
someone who has read, write, and create privileges in the Word program
directory on the server) runs Word from the server installation before
running a Workstation Setup to install Word on the workstation. Before you
run the Workstation Setup, no references to the file locations exists in
the Windows program directory, so when you quit Word the first time, it
stores the Winword.opt and the Normal.dot files on the server in the
directory where the Winword.exe program is located (the default location).
<P>
Once a Winword.opt or a Normal.dot file exists on the server, Word
uses these files every time it starts from any workstation, even if you
have run a Workstation Setup and created a reference that points to
another Winword.opt or Normal.dot location. This happens because as
Word starts it checks the directory where the Winword.exe file resides,
for these files. If it finds Winword.opt or Normal.dot in this location
it uses those files and does not read your reference file to attempt to
find them in another location.
<P>
NOTE: In some cases it is desirable to have everyone use the same
Normal.dot file and prevent any changes being made.
<P>
Infrequently, this problem also occurs if you ran the Workstation Setup
at your workstation while you were running Windows from a different
location (that is, from a location other than the one specified in your
network logon script).
<P>
NOTE: Word Setup does not create Winword.opt or the Normal.dot files.
Word creates new versions of these files any time you run the program
and the files are not located. Therefore, this is a network
administration issue rather than a Word Setup issue.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Perform all three of the following steps to resolve this problem and
restore each user's preference and option settings in Word:

<OL><P><LI>Quit all instances of Word running from the server. Rename or delete the
   Winword.opt and Normal.dot files in the network server directory.

<P><LI>Make sure the Word program directory on the network server and all
   files in that directory are flagged as read-only and shareable. You
   should not have write privileges in this server directory before you
   perform the Workstation Setup at the workstation.

<P><LI>Make sure you run a Workstation installation of Word at every
   workstation where the user has administrative rights (that is, full
   access to the Word program directory on the server). This process
   references that point to the correct location for your user's
   Winword.opt and Normal.dot files.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This section contains a description of the Word settings files
(Winword6.ini, Winword.opt, and Normal.dot) and a discussion of the
network installation of Word as it pertains to the problem addressed in
this article.
<P>
<P><h3>Settings Files Summary</h3>
 
<P>
Winword6.ini Primarily contains paths to file names. Setup installs
<PRE>             this file in the user's Windows program directory, or
             in the Windows user directory if you are running
             Windows from a network server. (Microsoft Word Version
             6.x only)

</PRE></OL>Winword.opt  A binary file that contains Word settings, including the
<PRE>             Recently Used File (MRU) list, most of the settings in the
             Tools Options dialog box, and default bullet formats. Word
             (not Setup) creates this file the first time you run the
             program, and places it in your user's Word directory. Word
             stores the location of your Winword.opt file in the
             WINWORD6.INI path as the INI-PATH setting. (Microsoft Word
             Version 6.x only)

Normal.dot   The default document template that stores macros,
             toolbars, menus, keystrokes, AutoText, and AutoCorrect
             entries. This file should be located in the user's
             Template directory and is created after the user makes a
             change to one of the items mentioned above. This file is
             not created by Setup. It is referenced in the Windows
             registry file for versions 7.x or 97 of Word or the
             Winword6.ini for Microsoft Word Version 6.x.

</PRE><h3>Overview: Network Setup of Word</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: This discussion assumes that you have a working knowledge of
network operations and terminology. For network-specific information,
see your network documentation.
<P>
To install Word so it runs from a network file server, go to a
workstation and connect to the file server. Run the administrator's
installation of Word (type "setup /a" at the command line). When Setup
prompts you for the network directory for the main Word program,
specify a path on the file server. Setup copies all the program files
to this location. For more information about this process, see pages
768 through 770 in the "Microsoft Word User's Guide."
<P>
IMPORTANT: DO NOT RUN WORD AT THIS POINT! If you do, the problems
described at the beginning of this article may occur. Before you run
Word, you must first perform the following two steps:

<OL><P><LI>Set the access privileges to read-only and shared for the server
   directories in which you installed Word. Refer to your MS-DOS or
   network operating system documentation for more information.

<P><LI>Run the workstation installation of Word at each workstation. This
   registers the Word program with your local Windows installation and
   creates references to file locations. If you do not run a
   workstation installation before you run Word from the network
   server, Word runs, but some operations do not function correctly,
   such as the spelling checker, grammar checking, and object linking
   and embedding (OLE ).
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you are running Windows from a network server, the first
workstation installation of Word makes all the necessary Windows-level
changes. This means you need all access privileges to the shared
Windows program directory, and that directory must not be read-only.
