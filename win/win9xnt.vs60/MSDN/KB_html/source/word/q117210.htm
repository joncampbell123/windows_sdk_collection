The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Find File command (located on the File menu) may fail to find files
when performing searches that includes wildcard characters such as the
asterisk or question mark.
<P>
<PRE>   If you search for      Word does not find files that
   -----------------      -----------------------------

   *.*                    Have no extension

   *.D*                   End with the single character D

   *.D0*                  End with DO

   *.???                  Have fewer than three characters in the extension

   *.??                   Have fewer than two characters in the extension

   .?                     Have no extension

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Word versions 6.0 and 6.0a
for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
Method 1: When searching for files with no extensions, use a single
<PRE>          asterisk in the File Name box and do not include the period which
          normally separates the filename and the extension. The drawback
          to this method is that it will list all files in the search path.

</PRE>Method 2: When searching for files containing a two-letter extension, use
<PRE>          the question mark (?) wildcard character. For example, to search
          for all files with a two-character extension, type "*.??"
          (without the quotation marks) in the File Name box. If you search
          for files with a single character extension, use "*.?" to find
          your files.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This functionality also works incorrectly in Microsoft Excel 5.0 and
PowerPoint 4.0. Using the wildcard characters in the File Open dialog box
in each of these applications works correctly. This feature works correctly
in Word versions 2.x.
