The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,
   2.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive the error
<P>
<PRE>   WordBasic Err=9 "Subscript Out of Range"

</PRE>when you use create a secondary table of authority entry using the table of
authority macros that are included in the Word 2.0 for Windows Legal
Resource Kit.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
From the Table of Authorities Entry dialog box, select Create Secondary TOA
Entry and choose OK. The next dialog box, titled Microsoft Word, has a
Section Heading list box that displays three items: Cases, Statutes, and
Other Authorities. None of these list box items is selected, although Cases
appears with a dotted-line surrounding it. If you choose OK without
selecting an item from the list, the error message will result. To prevent
the error, select one of the items and choose OK.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The table of authority macros consist of the following macros: AutoPlaceXE,
AutoFootnoteEntry, TableOfAuthorities, and TOAEntry. When installed, two
table of authority commands are placed on the Insert menu: TOA Entry and
Table Of Authorities.
<P>
The macro produces the error message because the variable "sectnum" (set to
"-1" earlier in the macro) returns the number for the section heading
selected. If none of the section headings are selected, the variable
"sectnum" remains "-1." The next command that executes after you choose OK
cannot accept a parameter value of "-1" and you will receive the "Subscript
Out of Range" error message.
<P>
The table of authority macros are designed for legal professionals to
assist them in the creation of a table of authorities. A table of authority
is similar to a bibliography and includes a list of the authorities--for
example, cases, statutes, and other authorities--cited in the legal
document.
<P>
The table of authority macros are included in the Legal Resource Kit (LRK)
for Word 2.0 for Windows, which you can obtain by calling the Microsoft
Sales Information Center at (800) 426-9400. There is no charge for the
Legal Resource Kit. You can also install the table of authority macros from
the NEWMACRO.DOC file that ships with Word 2.0 for Windows.
<P>
We recommend that customers interested in the table of authority feature
upgrade to Word 6.0 for Windows, which contains built-in table of authority
commands. More information about the Word 6.0 feature set can be obtained
by calling the Microsoft Sales Information Center at (800) 426-9400.
