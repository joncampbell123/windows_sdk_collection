The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,
   2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to disable Atech's FastFonts application
and how to undo the changes that FastFonts makes to your Windows
configuration when you install or disable this font package.
<P>
Note: Atech Software is no longer doing business. No support is
available for the FastFonts product.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To completely disable FastFonts, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Print Setup. Select the FastFonts
   printer driver and choose the Setup button.

<P><LI>Clear the Use FastFonts Screen Driver option in the printer driver
   setup dialog box and choose the OK button.

<P><LI>In the Print Setup dialog box, select another installed printer
   driver for your active printer and choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Exit and restart Windows.
<P>
</OL>When you exit and restart Windows, FastFonts modifies the SYSTEM.INI
file and restores the video driver that was active before you
installed FastFonts.
<P>
<P><h3>What Is FastFonts?</h3>
 
<P>
FastFonts is a Windows font manager and type library created by Atech,
based on their earlier Publisher's PowerPak font technology. FastFonts
lets you produce scalable, what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG)
fonts in the Windows environment. These fonts are scalable from 4 to
1000 points. Similar to Adobe Type Manager and Bitstream FaceLift,
FastFonts interacts with the Windows system and provides a main
application window that contains font management tools.
<P>
FastFonts fonts are printed as bitmap graphics; as a result, printing
is slower than when you print printer-resident fonts. Note, however,
that in applications such as Word for Windows the FastFonts fonts do
appear with a printer icon next to them, indicating these fonts can be
printed.
<P>
FastFonts consists of two key system components: a screen driver and a
printer driver. When you install FastFonts on your system, FastFonts does
the
following:

<UL><LI>It installs new Windows video and printer drivers.

<LI>It substitutes the FastFonts display driver for your current
   display driver.

<LI>It installs the FastFonts Printer Driver and adds it to your
   list of available printers.
<P>
</UL>In addition, FastFonts makes the following modifications to your
SYSTEM.INI and WIN.INI files:
<P>
<PRE>   SYSTEM.INI
   ----------

   [boot]
   display.drv=ffscr.drv

   [boot.description]
   display.drv=FastFonts Screen Driver

   WIN.INI
   -------

   [windows]
   device=FastFonts Printer Driver,FFPRN,LPT1:

</PRE></OL>Note: Using the above line while printing to a Hewlett Packard Laserjet
causes a "Cannot Open Source File" error in Word version 6.0.
<P>
The following new section is added to the end of you WIN.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   [FASTFONTS]
   config=ff.cfg
   prdate=6390

</PRE><h3>FastFonts Limitations</h3>
 

<UL><LI>FastFonts version 3.06 does not support printing greyscale bitmaps.

<LI>FastFonts has problems printing bitmaps. If you are unable to print
   a bitmap, try copying it into Windows Paintbrush and saving it from
   Paintbrush.

<LI>When you install FastFonts over a previous installation of
   Publisher's PowerPak, you may receive a general protection (GP)
   fault. To correct this problem, remove the PPAK.DRV file from your
   WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.
<P>
</UL>FastFonts was a product manufactured by Atech, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
