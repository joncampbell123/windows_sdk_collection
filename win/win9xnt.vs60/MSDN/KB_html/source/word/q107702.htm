The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Word Installer fails and gives the error message:
<P>
<PRE>   "Install" has the correct name but is not the correct disk.

</PRE>-or-
<P>
<PRE>   This is not the correct "Install" disk. Make sure you are
   using the original installer disk and try again.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The problem may occur for one of the following reasons:

<OL><P><LI>The same Install disk is used in two simultaneous installs.
<P>
   At the start of an installation, the Installer sets the Install disk in
   a certain state. To complete the installation, the Install disk must
   remain in that state. During the installation, if you use the Install
   disk to begin another installation, the Install disk won't be in the
   correct state to complete the first installation.
<P>
   Resolution: To avoid this problem, complete the installation on one
   machine entirely, and then proceed to the next machine.

<P><LI>The install disk has an extra folder.
<P>
   When backing up the Install disk, you may accidentally make an extra
   folder layer on the root level of the backup disk. The root level should
   not have a folder called Install.
<P>
   Resolution: Organize the contents of the Install disk so they exactly
   match the way the disk originally came from Microsoft. Typically, you
   must move the items in the Install folder to the root of the backup disk
   and then delete the Install folder.

<P><LI>A file from the Install disk is not in the correct location.
<P>
   This problem most commonly occurs because the Embedding Preferences file
   was removed from the Settings Files folder on the Install disk. During a
   previous installation attempt, Word may have given the error message
   "Installer cannot install the file Embedding Preferences on the hard
   drive, please delete this file and try again." The message refers to the
   Embedding Preferences file located in the Preferences folder (in the
   System Folder) on the startup drive, not the file located on the Install
   disk.
<P>
   Resolution: To correct this problem, make sure files on the Install disk
   are in the correct locations. If the problem is caused by the Embedding
   Preferences file being in an incorrect location, consider the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      To correct the problem, place the Embedding Preferences file (the one
      from the Install disk) back in the Settings Files folder on the
      Install disk. Also, remove the Embedding Preferences file from the
      Preferences folder (in the System Folder) on the startup disk.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      If you do not have the Embedding Preferences file that was on the
      Install disk, you can replace it with a copy from another Word 5.0 or
      5.1 Install disk, but you cannot replace it with a copy from the
      Preferences folder.
</PRE>
<P><LI>The Embedding Preferences file on the Install disk came from the startup
   drive's System Folder.
<P>
   This can happen while trying to correct the problem described in cause
   3, above.
