<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Sometimes the file size of your Word document changes substantially
(increases or decreases), even if you make only minor revisions to the
document. Moreover, the file size sometimes remains constant, even though
you made changes in the document. These changes in file size are a result
of the Fast Save feature.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The file size of your Word document may increase unexpectedly if the Allow
Fast Saves option is turned on. A fast save appends the changes to the end
of your document, which increases the size of the document. By contrast,
when you turn off the Allow Fast Saves option and save the document, Word
performs a full save, which incorporates all your revisions (instead of
appending them). If you perform a full save after a file was fast saved,
Word rewrites the file thus reducing the size of the file.
<P>
Even with the Allow Fast Saves option turned on, Word periodically performs
a full save of your document. As a result, the file size of your document
may change substantially between save operations.
<P>
NOTE: If you open a document from a previous version of Word, Word may
temporarily allocate more disk space for the document than is actually
necessary.
<P>
To disable the Allow Fast Save feature, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Preferences.

<P><LI>Click the Save tab.

<P><LI>Click to clear the Allow Fast Saves check box.
<P>
</OL>For additional information about this situation in earlier versions of
Word, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
