<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has developed an internal tool called the Windows Help Authoring
Toolkit for Microsoft Word version 6.0 for Windows (WHAT6). This tool is
used within Microsoft to help create Help files. Microsoft is now providing
this internal tool to our customers.
<P>
NOTE: To create Help files with versions of Word later than Word 6.0, use
the Microsoft Windows 95 Help Authoring Kit. For information about how to
obtain a version of this kit that will work with Word 97, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

files it contains.

<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows Help Authoring Toolkit for Microsoft Word version 6.0 for
Windows (WHAT6) consists of a Microsoft Word version 6.0 template file
(WHAT6.DOT), Help files to assist you in using WHAT6.DOT, and Windows
programs for creating bitmap hotspots and managing your Help project.
<P>
WHAT6 helps you create and edit Help topics. WHAT6 makes creating Help
files easier by providing dialog boxes to add Help features that would
otherwise need to be created using specialized Help coding and word-
processing functions. For example, instead of entering footnotes for a
topic's context string and title, you can type the information into a
dialog box.
<P>
The Help Authoring Template (WHAT6.DOT) makes it easier for you to:

<UL><LI>Create and edit topic files.
<LI>Insert and edit topics, graphics, and hot spots.
<LI>Format topic text and graphics.
<LI>Save topic files in RTF format.
<LI>View partial or complete builds of the topic file in Windows Help.
<LI>Insert bitmaps into your help file.
<LI>Apply help styles.
<LI>Format Lists.
<P>
</UL><h3>How the WHAT6.DOT Template Works</h3>
 
<P>
The Help Authoring Template is similar to other Word for Windows templates.
It contains a set of specialized macros and styles that become available
when you open a document based on the template. The template modifies
existing commands and adds new commands to the Word for Windows menus. The
result is a version of Word for Windows that has all the word-processing
functionality and yet is optimized for creating Help files.
<P>
<P><h3>Requirements</h3>
 
<P>
The WHAT6.DOT template requires Microsoft Word version 6.0 for Windows and
Windows Help version 3.10.505, which is fully compatible with Word for
Windows 6.0 Rich Text Format (RTF).
