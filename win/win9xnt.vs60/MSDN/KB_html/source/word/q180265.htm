The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you save a document in Word 98 Macintosh Edition as Text Only with
Line Breaks or MS-DOS Text With Line Breaks, then open it on a VAX system
or Bulletin Board Service, the paragraph marks that signify returns will
appear, but there will be no line feed character. The text will appear as
one long continuous string and will be unusable by the VAX or BBS.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The line feed character is not automatically inserted following a paragraph
mark.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
In Word 98 Macintosh Edition, save the document as Text Only With Line
Breaks, Text With Layout, or MS-DOS Text With Line Breaks. To do this,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Save as Text Only with Line Breaks
<P>
   a. On the File menu, click Save As.
<P>
   b. In the Save File as Type box, scroll and select Text Only with Line
<P><PRE>      Breaks.
</PRE><P>
   c. Type a file name under "Save Current Document as," and then click
<P><PRE>      Save.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Use the Replace command to find the paragraph marks (^13) and change
   them to a paragraph mark, line feed character, (^13^10) by doing the
   following:
<P>
   a. On the Edit menu, click Replace.
<P>
   b. In Find What, type ^13, and in Replace With, type ^13^10.
<P>
   c. Click Replace All.

<P><LI>Then save the document as Text Only and transfer the file to the VAX or
   BBS by doing the following:
<P>
   a. On the File menu, click Save As.
<P>
   b. In the Save File As Type box, scroll and select Text Only, click
<P><PRE>      Save.
</PRE><P>
   c. See your administrator for instructions on uploading files to BBS.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Most word processors on the Macintosh and Windows platform recognize a
paragraph mark as an end of line mark and a line feed character. Text
editors on the VAX or BBS do not automatically insert a line feed character
when they see a paragraph mark. Most Unix mail systems require that there
be no more than 256 characters before a carriage return. In order to keep
files Word saved from exceeding that limitation, files should be saved
in Text Only With Line Breaks format.
<P>
Line Feeds are ASCII value ^10 and are required by printers to trigger the
mechanism to advance the paper. Paragraph marks, line breaks, and carriage
returns are ASCII value ^13, the value that triggers the print head to
RETURN to the left side of the CARRIAGE (thus the phrase "Carriage
Return").
