The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c,
   6.0, 6.0a
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When using PowerLeads! there are two ways to merge data to Microsoft Word
for Windows. You can write a letter to a single customer, or you can use
the PowerLeads! mail merge option.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Writing a Letter</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start PowerLeads!

<P><LI>Open the desired database.

<P><LI>From the Record menu, choose Write Letter.

<P><LI>When prompted with "OK to write a letter to the  contact," choose Yes.

<P><LI>Choose Yes when prompted "OK to use the default letter template?"
   PowerLeads! displays a message that it is "Sending letters to Microsoft
   Word."
<P>
</OL>Word opens with the mail merge main document displayed on screen. This
document is attached to the template PWRWORD2.DOT (PWRWINWORD2.DOT in Word
6.0), supplied with PowerLeads! The data is attached as DATADOC.TXT and the
header is attached as PWRFLDS.TXT. You are now ready to merge to a new
document or directly to the printer.
<P>
<P><h3>Merging the Database to Microsoft Word</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start PowerLeads!

<P><LI>Open the desired database.

<P><LI>From the Database Menu, choose Mailmerge.

<P><LI>Select from the available options (select all the records, define a new
   query, or recall a query).

<P><LI>PowerLeads! prompts you with the message, "Mailmerge requested is the
   entire database. Is this really what you want to do?" Choose Yes.

<P><LI>Choose OK when prompted to use the default letter template.
<P>
</OL>Word opens with the mail merge main document displayed on screen. This
document is attached to the template PWRWORD2.DOT (PWRWINWORD2.DOT in Word
6.0), supplied with PowerLeads! The data is attached as DATADOC.TXT and the
header is attached as PWRFLDS.TXT. You are now ready to merge to a new
document or directly to the printer.
<P>
Note: When first attempting to write a letter or merging from PowerLeads!
to Word version 6.0, you will receive the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Word Err=1041
   This document template does not exist.

</PRE></OL>This happens because PWRWINWORD2.DOT does not actually ship with
PowerLeads!
version 1.2, even though PowerLeads is looking for this template.
PowerLeads! ships with PWRWORD2.DOT which may be converted by opening it in
Word version 6.0 and saving it as PWRWINWORD2.DOT.
