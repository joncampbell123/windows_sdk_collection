<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following error message may occur if you open a Word document that
contains an object and then attempt to move the object:
<P>
<PRE>   There are too many edits in the document. This operation will
   be incomplete. Save your work.

</PRE>This error message may appear even if you did no other editing prior to
moving the object.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Word cannot move the object if you have insufficient disk space.
<P>
In Windows this amount of space is determined by the available space in 
your temporary (TEMP) directory (you designate this directory using the SET 
TEMP statement). On the Macintosh, this situation is influenced only by the 
availability of disk space.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Free up some disk space (in Windows, free up space on the drive that 
contains the TEMP directory).
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Word for the Macintosh uses a similar technique for tracking changes
during an edit session. It creates Word Work Files in the same location
as the previously saved Word document. Typically Word Work Files will
have either an alphabetic or alphanumeric suffix, such as "Word Work
File D" or "Word Work File A2."
<P>
Because the Macintosh operating system does not provide for the
definition of a Temp directory, Word Work Files are limited only by
available disk space and the internal cache for Word.
<P>
By design, these files track changes for the Fast Save and AutoSave
features and are removed when the current file is saved normally or
when you quit Word. However, if Word abruptly freezes or quits due to a
system error, these files are left behind. These remaining files may
cause problems in subsequent editing sessions when Word attempts to
track an operation such as moving an object.
