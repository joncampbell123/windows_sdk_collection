The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes two methods you can use to print envelopes to the
Apple LaserWriter 4/600 and Personal LaserWriter 320: you can print
envelopes to these printers by using the Envelopes And Labels dialog box or
by using the Mail Merge feature.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Before you print envelopes in Word, you must select the correct PPD
(printer description file) in the Chooser and set a printer heuristic. The
printer heuristic causes the Page Setup dialog box to be displayed so that
you can select the appropriate envelope size.
<P>
<P><h2>CONFIGURING THE PRINTER DRIVER</h2>
 
<P>
In order to print envelopes correctly, use version 8.0 or later of the
Apple LaserWriter printer driver (8.1.1 or later preferred).
<P>
To configure the printer driver:

<OL><P><LI>On the Apple menu, click Chooser.

<P><LI>Locate the printer driver for your LaserWriter and select it.

<P><LI>Select the actual printer in the "Select a &lt;Printer Driver Name&gt;
    Printer" list.

<P><LI>Click Setup.

<P><LI>Click Auto Setup.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
    The PPD should be automatically selected for you.
<P>
    NOTE: If you receive a warning message that the correct printer
    description file (PPD) cannot be found, make sure that you have the PPD
    for your printer in the Printer Descriptions folder (either in the
    System folder or in the Extensions folder). If you ran the standard
    setup for the driver, this file should be properly installed.
<P>
    Valid PPDs for the LaserWriter 4/600 and LaserWriter 320 are listed in
    the following table.
<P>
<PRE>       Model                            PPD
       --------------------------------------------------------------

       Apple LaserWriter 4/600          LaserWriter 4/600 PS
       Apple LaserWriter 320            LaserWriter Personal 320

</PRE><P><LI>Click Configure.

<P><LI>Choose the correct settings for your printer, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
    NOTE: If you do not know certain items of your printer's configuration,
    the Printer Info button in the Printer Setup dialog may provide the
    information. The dialog box will tell you whether or not certain
    options are installed including the types of networks supported and how
    much memory is installed in the printer.

<P><LI>Close the Chooser.
<P>
</OL><h2>SETTING THE PRINTER HEURISTIC IN WORD</h2>
 
<P>
The printer heuristic setting forces the Page Setup dialog box to appear
when you click the Print button in the Envelopes dialog box. This dialog
box allows you to set the paper size to Envelope so that your printer will
use the envelope feeder (or manual feeder).
<P>
NOTE: You need to set this heuristic only once for your selected printer
driver. You do not need to set the heuristic each time you print an
envelope.
<P>
To set this heuristic, start Word and then do the following:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Macro.

<P><LI>Select Word Commands from the Macros Available In drop-down list.

<P><LI>In the Macro Name box, type "ToolsAdvancedSettings" (without the
   quotation marks), and then click Run.

<P><LI>Select your printer driver from the Categories list. (It should be
   something like LaserWriter 8 or LaserWriter 8.1.1.)

<P><LI>Press TAB to select the text in the Option text box. Delete the text (if
   any) and type "Flags" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Press TAB to select the text in the Setting text box. Delete the text
   and type "4" (without the quotation marks). Then, click Set and click
   OK.

<P><LI>Quit Word and then restart Word. (The setting is not saved until you
   quit Word.)
<P>
</OL><h2>PRINTING ENVELOPES</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>To print envelopes from the Envelope dialog box</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Envelopes And Labels. Select the Envelopes
   tab.

<P><LI>Type the return and destination addresses.

<P><LI>Choose the Options button. Select the Printing Options tab.

<P><LI>Choose the Left Portrait icon (fourth from the left), and make sure
   the Face Up option is selected and the Clockwise Rotation check box is
   selected.

<P><LI>Select the Envelope Options tab. Under Envelope Size, select Size 10
   (4 1/8 x 9 1/2 in). If desired, add bar codes and change the font of
   the return and/or destination addresses. Choose OK.

<P><LI>Choose the Print button.
<P>
   The Page Setup dialog box should appear.

<P><LI>In the Page Setup dialog box, make sure Landscape orientation is
   selected and set the Paper Size to "Comm 10 Envelope." Click OK.

<P><LI>In the dialog box, click Print (manual feed should already be
   selected).
<P>
   The orange light on the printer should begin blinking, indicating that
   the printer is ready for an envelope.
<P>
   NOTE: When you use version 8.2 or 8.3 of the LaserWriter printer driver,
   you may receive a dialog box prompting you to switch to the Print
   Monitor. After you switch to the PrintMonitor, insert a piece of paper
   in the manual tray and click OK.

<P><LI>Insert the envelope face up, slipping it edge first (as indicated on the
   engraved diagram), into the gap between the paper tray and the top edge
   of the printer. It should just touch the feed wheel at which point the
   printer should grasp it and pull it in slightly. The orange light should
   go off and the printer will begin printing the envelope.
<P>
</OL><h3>To Print Envelopes Using the Mail Merge Command</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Mail Merge.

<P><LI>In the Mail Merge Helper dialog box, under Step 1: Main Document,
    choose Create Envelopes. Select Active Window or New Main Document.

<P><LI>Under Step 2: Data Source, choose Create Data Source. If your data file
    has already been created, select Get Data, and then select Open Data
    Source from the list that appears. Select your data file in the Open
    dialog box and choose Open.
<P>
   NOTE: Skip steps 4, 5, and 11 if you opened an existing data file in
   step 3.

<P><LI>Choose the desired fields (for example, Title, First Name, Last Name,
    Address, and so forth) and select OK.

<P><LI>Give the data source (data document) a name in the Save Current
    Document As box and save the document.

<P><LI>In the next dialog box, choose the Set Up Main Document button, which
    will open the Envelope Options dialog box.

<P><LI>Select the Envelope Options tab and select the envelope size (Size 10).

<P><LI>Select the Printing Options tab, choose the Left Portrait icon (fourth
    from the left), and make sure the Face Up option is selected and the
    Clockwise Rotation check box is selected. Click OK.

<P><LI>In the Envelope Address dialog box, insert the merge fields for the
    destination address. Choose the Insert Postal Bar Code button if you
    want to add a postal bar code or an FIM-A courtesy reply mail bar code
    to your envelopes. Choose OK. The Page Setup dialog box should appear.

<P><LI>In the Page Setup dialog box, make sure Landscape orientation is
    selected and set the Paper size to "Comm 10 Envelope." Click OK.

<P><LI>In the Mail Merge Helper dialog box, under Step 2: Data Source, select
    Edit Data: &lt;&lt;document name&gt;&gt;, and enter your data in the data form.
    Choose OK.

<P><LI>The main document is now set up properly to print envelopes and be
    merged with the data source (data file). Choose the Merge To Printer
    button on the Mail Merge toolbar. Or, if you are still in the Mail
    Merge Helper dialog box, choose the Merge button under Step 3: Merge
    the Data with the Document, select Merge To Printer, and choose Merge.

<P><LI>In the dialog box , click Print (manual feed should already be
    selected).
<P>
    The orange light on the printer should begin blinking indicating it is
    ready for an envelope.

<P><LI>Insert the first envelope Face Up, slipping it edge first (as indicated
    on the engraved diagram) into the gap between the paper tray and the
    top edge of the printer. It should just touch the feed wheel at which
    point the printer should grasp it and pull it in slightly. The orange
    light should go off and the printer will begin printing the envelope.
<P>
    NOTE: The first envelope will be printed and then the printer will go
    off-line and the orange "paper feed" light will blink until the next
    envelope is inserted.  This will occur for each envelope until the last
    envelope is pulled.

<P><LI>Continue feeding envelopes until the mail merge is completed.
