The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,
   2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Word for Windows, strikethrough character formatting does
not print or display correctly when applied to text formatted with
small caps. The strikethrough formatting on text formatted with small
caps does not align with the strikethrough formatting on other text.
This causes a jagged, crooked line through text that contains both
small caps formatting and other character formatting. Similarly,
strikethrough character formatting applied to lowercase small caps
does not align with strikethrough character formatting applied to
uppercase small caps of the same font and size.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Strikethrough formatting applied to text with small caps formatting is
positioned higher than strikethrough formatting applied to text
without small caps formatting. Strikethrough formatting also misaligns
on small caps of varying point sizes, uppercase letters, numbers, and
punctuation characters (commas, apostrophes, periods, and so forth).
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Word for Windows version 6.0
 
<P>
If you need to apply strikethrough formatting to text with small caps in
Word for Windows version 6.0, you can change the small caps to allcaps
with a smaller point size. In Word for Windows version 6.0,
strikethrough character formatting applied to text formatted with all
caps prints correctly.
<P>
Strikethrough formatting is applied to deleted text when you choose the
Revisions command from the Tools menu. strikethrough formatting applied
in this manner aligns incorrectly.  With revision marks enabled,
strikethrough formatting is applied to text that you delete by pressing
the DELETE key or by pressing the BACKSPACE key.
<P>
<P><h3>Word for Windows Version 2.0</h3>
 
<P>
If you need to apply strikethrough formatting to text with small caps
in Word for Windows version 2.0, you can change the small caps to all
caps with a smaller point size. In Word for Windows version 2.0,
strikethrough character formatting applied to text formatted with all
caps prints correctly.
<P>
Strikethrough formatting is applied to deleted text when you choose
the Revision Marks command from the Tools menu. Strikethrough
formatting applied in this manner aligns correctly. With revision
marks enabled, strikethrough formatting is applied to text that you
delete by pressing the DELETE key or by pressing the BACKSPACE key.
<P>
<P><h3>Word for Windows Version 1.x</h3>
 
<P>
In Word for Windows versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.1a, strikethrough
formatting is not available as a character format. Strikethrough
formatting is applied by choosing Revision Marks from the Utilities
menu. With revision marks enabled, strikethrough formatting is applied
to text that you delete by pressing the DELETE key or by pressing the
BACKSPACE key.
<P>
Note: In Word for Windows version 1.x, strikethrough formatting
applied to the spaces between words displays and prints higher than
strikethrough formatting applied to other characters. In Word for
Windows version 2.0, strikethrough formatting aligns consistently on
spaces and other characters.
