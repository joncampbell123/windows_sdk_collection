<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Go To command (Edit menu) to go to the first bookmark that
is contained in an included document, the entire included document is
selected instead of just the desired bookmarked text.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The bookmarked text is at the beginning of the included document.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Add a Blank Line Above the Bookmarked Text</h3>
 
<P>
Open the document that is to be included, and ensure that the first
bookmarked text is not at the beginning of the document. To view the
bookmarks, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click the View tab.

<P><LI>Click to select the Bookmarks check box, and then click OK.
<P>
   Your bookmarks will appear either as a large "I" or as large square
   brackets ([]).
<P>
</OL>NOTE: You will need to delete the first bookmark, add a blank line above
the bookmarked text, and then insert the bookmark again.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Do Not Link to File</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In a new document, click File on the Insert menu.

<P><LI>Select the document that contains the bookmarks, and then click OK.
<P>
   NOTE: Do not click to select the "Link To File" check box. If you select
   this check box, your document will be inserted with an IncludeText
   field, and you will have to use Method 1.
<P>
</OL>The document containing the bookmarks will be inserted as text, not an
IncludeText field. When you use the Go To command to go to the first
bookmark contained in the inserted file, only the bookmarked text will be
selected, not the entire included document.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you use an IncludeText field, or when you "Link To File," the
IncludeText field is selected when you use the Go To command to go to the
first bookmark contained in the included document.
