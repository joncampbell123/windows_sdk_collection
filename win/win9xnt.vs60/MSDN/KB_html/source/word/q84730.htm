The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following is the complete text of the "Playing Movies in Word" file.
This file is a Word document and is located on the Movie Plug-In Module
(PIM) disk.
<P>
<P><h3>Playing Movies in Word</h3>
 
<P>
This document describes how to use the Microsoft Movie Plug-In Module (PIM)
to insert and play QuickTime movies in your Microsoft Word documents. For
instructions on installing the Microsoft Movie PIM, see the TeachText file
"Installing the PIM," which is also on the disk containing the Microsoft
Movie PIM file.
<P>
Inserting a Movie in a Word Document:
<P>
You can insert a QuickTime movie into a Word document in the following
ways:

<UL><LI>Use the Movie command on the Insert menu.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If the Movie command is not on the menu, make sure that the Microsoft
   Movie PIM file is in the Word Commands folder.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Move or copy the movie from another document or application that
   supports QuickTime.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use the Play Movie command on the View menu to play a movie and copy one
   or more frames of the movie into your document. For instructions on
   using the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands to move and copy movie frames,
   see "Using Cut, Copy, and Paste to Edit Movie Frames" later in this
   document.
<P>
</UL>After you've inserted a movie, the movie display picture -- a PICT image of
a frame of the movie or the movie "poster" -- is displayed in the document.
To distinguish the display picture from an ordinary graphic in your
document, the lower-left corner of the display picture contains a movie
badge. The badge looks like a small picture of film.
<P>
When a movie is stopped, you can edit and format the movie as you would any
graphic. For example, you can add borders to a movie, move or copy a movie
to another location in your document, and position a movie on the page
using the Frame commands on the Insert and Format menus. You cannot,
however, crop or scale a movie display picture.
<P>
To insert a movie:

<OL><P><LI>In your Word document, position the insertion point where you want the
   movie.

<P><LI>From the Insert menu, choose Movie.

<P><LI>In the dialog box, select the movie.
<P>
   To see the first frame of the movie, select the Show Preview checkbox.
<P>
   If you're previewing the movie for the first time and no preview frame
   is available, click the Create button to display the movie frame.

<P><LI>Click the Open button.
<P>
   The movie begins playing in a small window. You can pause, advance, or
   rewind the movie using the controller bar, which is displayed at the
   bottom of the window.

<P><LI>Click the close box to close the movie window and insert the movie in
   your document.
<P>
</OL>To move or copy a movie from another document or application:

<OL><P><LI>In the document that contains the movie, make sure the movie is stopped.
   To stop the movie, click outside the movie in the document.

<P><LI>Click the movie (not the movie badge) to select it.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu of the application, choose Copy. The entire movie is
   copied to the Clipboard.

<P><LI>Switch to Word and position the insertion point in the document where
   you want the movie. Then choose Paste from the Edit menu.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you move or copy the document that contains the movie to another
disk, make sure you also move the movie data file to that disk. Otherwise,
you will not be able to play the movie in its new location. For more
information, see the note "Movie Data File" later in this document.
<P>
<P><h3>Playing a Movie</h3>
 
<P>
You can play a movie in a Word document by clicking the movie badge or
double-clicking the movie display picture. You can also play movies that
are not in a Word document using the Play Movie command on the View menu.
Play Movie plays the movie in a separate movie window without inserting the
movie in your document, unlike the Movie command on the Insert menu.
<P>
When you play a movie, Word by default displays a controller bar below the
movie. You use the controller bar, shown in the illustration below, to
control the movie playback. The Forward and Rewind buttons may not be
available on the controller bar, depending on the width of the movie frame.
When you stop a movie, Word hides the controller bar.
<P>
<P><h3>Controller Bar</h3>
 
<P>
If you prefer, you can play a movie without the controller bar by clearing
the Double-Click Shows Controller checkbox in the Movie Options dialog box.
(For more information, see "Changing Movie Options" later in this
document.) When you play a movie without the controller bar, the mouse
pointer shape resembles the Pause button. You can stop a movie using the
mouse, but you cannot freeze a frame or advance or rewind a movie without
the controller bar.
<P>
If you play a movie in a document and the entire display picture isn't
visible in the document window, Word plays the movie in a separate movie
window but doesn't change the movie's location in your document. After you
play the movie, close the movie window.
<P>
The following table describes how to select and play movies using the
mouse:

<UL><LI>To select the entire movie for moving, copying, or formatting: Click the
   movie (not the movie badge) when the movie is stopped.

<LI>To display the controller bar: Click the movie badge.

<LI>To play a movie: Double-click the movie, or click the Play button of the
   controller bar.

<LI>To stop a movie: Click outside the movie. If playing the movie without
   the controller, click the movie or in the document with the pause
   pointer.

<LI>To freeze the current frame: Click the Pause button of the controller
   bar or click the movie.

<LI>To restart play from the current frame after pausing: Double-click the
   movie.

<LI>To advance one frame: Click the Forward button of the controller bar.

<LI>To go back one frame: Click the Rewind button of the controller bar.

<LI>To advance or rewind several frames: Drag the Slide forward or backward,
   or point to the Forward or Rewind buttons and hold down the mouse
   button.

<LI>To adjust the volume: Click the Volume button of the controller bar and
   drag the volume control up or down.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: When you click the Pause button or click the movie to freeze a frame,
there may be a short delay before the movie pauses. If the movie doesn't
pause on the frame you want, click the Rewind or Forward button on the
controller bar to return to the frame.
<P>
<P><h3>To Play a Movie Without Inserting It in a Document</h3>
 
<P>
If you freeze a movie in your document and its controller bar is showing,
the Play Movie command cannot be used to play a second movie. (Play Movie
has no effect when you choose it from the menu.) Stop the movie in your
document before choosing Play Movie.

<OL><P><LI>If a movie in your document is currently playing, click outside the
   movie to stop it.

<P><LI>From the View menu, choose Play Movie.

<P><LI>In the dialog box, select the movie.
<P>
   To see the first frame of the movie, select the Show Preview checkbox.
   If you're previewing the movie for the first time and no preview frame
   is available, click the Create button to display the movie frame.

<P><LI>Click the Open button.
<P>
   The movie begins playing in a small window. You can freeze a frame of
   the movie and select one or more frames to copy into your document.

<P><LI>Click the close box to close the movie window.
<P>
   Note: If Play Movie is not on the View menu, choose Commands from the
   Tools menu, select the Play Movie command from the list, and click the
   Add button under Menu. Then click the Close button to close the dialog
   box.
<P>
</OL><h3>Using Cut, Copy, and Paste to Edit Movie Frames</h3>
 
<P>
Using the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands on the Edit menu, you can cut or
copy single frames or a sequence of frames from a movie. For example, you
can paste a single frame to use as an illustration in a document, cut
unwanted frames from a movie, or copy a selected sequence of frames from a
longer movie.
<P>
You can paste frames from the Clipboard into another movie or into your
document. Pasting a single frame in a document makes the frame an ordinary
PICT graphic. Pasting a sequence of frames in a document in effect creates
a new movie. When you paste the frames in a document, the first frame of
the selection is displayed with a badge, indicating the PICT image is a
movie display picture.
<P>
To cut or copy a single movie frame:

<OL><P><LI>Play the movie, and then freeze the movie on the frame you want.

<P><LI>Cut or copy the frame to the Clipboard.
<P>
</OL>To cut or copy a sequence of movie frames:

<OL><P><LI>Play the movie using the controller bar, and then freeze the movie on
   the first frame you want in the sequence.

<P><LI>Hold down the SHIFT key and, using the mouse, slowly drag the Slide on
   the controller bar until all the frames in the sequence are selected.
   You can also click the Forward or Rewind button while holding down
   SHIFT.
<P>
   The Slide is shaded to indicate that more than one frame is selected.

<P><LI>Cut or copy the frames to the Clipboard.
<P>
</OL>To paste frames into a movie:

<OL><P><LI>Play the movie that contains the frames you want and cut or copy the
   frames to the Clipboard, then stop the movie. If you are playing the
   movie using Play Movie, close the movie window.

<P><LI>Play the movie that you want to add frames to.

<P><LI>Freeze the movie on the frame that you want to come after the frames you
   are adding. Then paste the frames into the movie.
<P>
</OL><h3>Changing Movie Options</h3>
 
<P>
When you select a stopped movie or freeze a movie frame during playback,
the Edit Object command on the Edit menu becomes the Edit Movie command.
You can use the Edit Movie command to change options controlling the movie
playback. The options you select are used only for the selected movie.
<P>
You can also change the playback options for a movie by selecting the movie
when it is stopped and choosing the Object Options command on the Edit
menu. Choosing the Edit button in the Object Options dialog box displays
the Movie Options dialog box.
<P>
To change movie playback options:

<OL><P><LI>If the movie is stopped, click the movie once to select it.
<P>
   Make sure only the movie is selected. If the selection includes a space
   or other character, the Edit Movie command will not be available.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Edit Movie. Word displays the Movie Options
   dialog box.

<P><LI>Select or clear the checkboxes you want, and then click the OK button.
<P>
</OL><h3>Movie Options</h3>
 
<P>
Always Show Badge:
<P>
Displays a small picture of film in the lower-left corner of the movie
display picture when the movie is stopped. The badge indicates the display
picture is a movie, not an ordinary graphic. This checkbox is selected by
default.
<P>
Play Continuously:
<P>
Replays the movie continuously from the beginning until you stop the movie.
This checkbox is cleared by default.
<P>
Loop Back And Forth:
<P>
Plays the movie once from the beginning to the end and then from the end to
the beginning. If the movie includes sound, the sound is also played
backward. If Play Continuously is also selected, the movie loops back and
forth until you stop it. This checkbox is cleared by default.
<P>
Double-Click Shows Controller:
<P>
Plays the movie with the controller bar displayed. If you play a movie
without this option, the mouse pointer changes to the "pause" symbol while
the movie is playing. This checkbox is selected by default.
<P>
Keep This Display Picture:
<P>
Displays the current frame of the movie when the movie is stopped. Without
this option, the first frame of the movie or the movie "poster" PICT is
used as the display picture. If you've already selected a frame as the
display picture and want to use a different frame, first freeze the movie
on the frame you want to use as the new display picture. Choose Edit Movie,
clear the Keep This Display Picture checkbox, and click the OK button. Then
choose Edit Movie again and select this checkbox. This checkbox is cleared
by default.
<P>
Always Play From First Frame:
<P>
Always resumes play from the beginning after the movie has been stopped.
However, after a pause the movie continues to play from its current frame.
This checkbox is cleared by default.
<P>
<P><h3>Notes</h3>
 
<P>
Movie Quality:
<P>
The image and sound quality, the speed and smoothness of movie play, and
other aspects of the movie quality depend entirely on the original quality
of the movie and the capabilities of your Macintosh computer and monitor.
For more information, contact your Apple dealer or Apple Computer, Inc.
<P>
Movie Data File:
<P>
The movie data file contains the information needed to play a movie. If you
move the document containing the movie to a different disk or computer, be
sure to include the movie data file. If you are using a CD-ROM drive, you
can significantly increase performance by copying the movie data file, if
possible, to your local hard drive. If you attempt to play a movie and the
movie data file is on a network drive, a dialog box is displayed, prompting
you to connect to the drive. If you attempt to play a movie and the movie
data file is on a floppy disk, you're prompted to insert the disk. For this
reason, you should always name a floppy disk on which a movie data file is
stored-do not leave the disk named "Untitled."
<P>
Note: If you are using system 6.0.7 and are prompted to insert a disk
labeled "Untitled" to locate a movie data file, you can press
COMMAND+PERIOD to close the message box if you aren't sure you have the
floppy disk that contains the movie data file.
<P>
Freezing the Movie Using the Object Options Command:
<P>
You can convert a movie to an ordinary graphic using the Object Options
command on the Edit menu. Select the movie when it is stopped, choose
Object Options, and then click the Freeze Picture button. Word converts the
movie display picture to an ordinary PICT graphic that can no longer be
played as a movie. Note that if the movie badge is showing when the display
picture is frozen, the badge is included in the graphic. To avoid confusing
the graphic with a movie, you can hide the movie badge (clear the Always
Show Badge checkbox in the Movie Options dialog box) before freezing the
movie.
<P>
Sharing a Word Document that Contains a Movie:
<P>
Users who do not have the Microsoft Movie PIM installed in Word version 5.0
or the QuickTime system extension installed in their System can open, edit,
and use a Word document that contains a movie. However, if they attempt to
play the movie, a message is displayed stating that the editor for the
movie object can't be located. If 32- bit color QuickDraw graphics are not
supported by the computer on which the document is opened, the movie in the
document is replaced by a bitmapped graphic containing the QuickTime
symbol. For more information about the requirements for using QuickTime
movies in Word, see the TeachText document "Installing the PIM," which is
on the disk containing the Microsoft Movie PIM file.
<P>
Opening Documents with Movies in Word Version 4.0:
<P>
If you open a document that contains a movie in Microsoft Word version 4.0
and save the document, the movie display picture becomes an ordinary
graphic. To play the movie, you'll need to reinsert the movie in the
document using Word version 5.0.
