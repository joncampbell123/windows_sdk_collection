The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Word 97 for Windows includes 3 templates that contain sample macros that
are not immediately available after you install Word. After running a
Complete installation of Word 97 for Windows, the following files are
copied to a Macros folder in the default directory, C:\Program
Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Macros:
<P>
<PRE>   Convert8.WIZ
   Macros8.DOT
   Support8.DOT

</PRE>This article discusses information about these templates and macros as well
as how to access these macros.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To access the Word sample macros, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Make sure the macros were installed by Setup.
<P>
   The macros are installed if you performed a Custom installation and
   explicitly chose to install the macros or if you chose the Select All
   button to install all of the Office or Word program.
<P>
   In the Office Setup program the macros can be found under Microsoft
   Word, Wizards And Templates, and then Macro Templates. For additional
   information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
   Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../office/q120802.htm">Q120802</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Office: How to Add/Remove a Single Office Program or
                  Component

</PRE><P><LI>Decide how often you will use the macros. If you will only be using the
   macros occasionally, or if you want to see what the macros do before you
   decide whether you want to make them easily accessible, use Method 1. If
   you will be using the macros often, use either of the options discussed
   in Method 2.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 1: If You Will Be Using the Macros Occasionally</h3>
 
<P>
If you will be using the macros occasionally (or if you want to see what
they do before you decide to make them easily accessible), add the macro
templates as global templates.
<P>
NOTE: When you load a template or add-in, it remains loaded for the
current Word session. If you quit and then restart Word, the template or
add-in is not automatically reloaded.
<P>
To add one of the files listed in the "Summary" section as a global
template, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Templates And Add-Ins.

<P><LI>Under Global Templates And Add-ins, click Add.

<P><LI>In the Look In box, change the folder to C:\Program Files\Microsoft
   Office\Office\Macros, and in the Files Of Type box, select All Files
   (*.*).

<P><LI>Click Convert8.WIZ, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 3-4 for the Macros8.DOT and Support8.DOT files.

<P><LI>After all files are showing in the Templates And Add-ins dialog box,
   make sure you place a check mark in the check box for the ones you want
   to load, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: If You Will Be Using the Macros Often</h3>
 
<P>
Option 1: Move the Templates into the Startup Folder:
<P>
Word will automatically have access to any macros in templates that are
placed in the Microsoft Office\Office\Startup folder. Using Windows
Explorer, place copies of the Convert8.wiz, Macros8.dot, or Support8.dot
files into the Startup folder.
<P>
When you restart Word, these templates will be global templates and the
macros will be visible in the Macro dialog box. Note that a disadvantage to
this method is that Word will take a bit longer to start (each time it
starts, it will load these templates globally).
<P>
Option 2: Copy the Macros into the Normal Template:
<P>
Follow these steps to copy the macros into the Normal template
(Normal.dot):

<OL><P><LI>Open Convert8.WIZ.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Templates And Add-Ins, click Organizer, and
   then select the Macro Project Items tab.

<P><LI>The macros in the Convert8.WIZ template should be listed on one side of
   the dialog box. Normal.dot should be open on the other side.

<P><LI>Select the macros in Convert8.WIZ, and then click the Copy button. Click
   OK to close the Organizer.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 1-4 for Macros8.DOT and Support8.DOT
<P>
</OL>The Convert8.WIZ is a wizard that contains the following useful macros to
simplify converting and changing conversion options:
<P>
<PRE>   Macro                     Explanation and Notes
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   AutoNew.Main              When opening a new document based on
                             Convert8.WIZ, it will present a dialog box and
                             ask if you want to perform a batch conversion
                             of files. Selecting this will start the macro
                             StartConversionWizard. It will also ask if you
                             want to Edit converter or filter options.
                             Selecting this option will start the macro
                             EditConversionOptions.

   AutoOpen.Options          This macro runs when you open the Convert8.WIZ
                             file and will ask the same questions as listed
                             in the explanation and notes to the
                             AutoNew.Main macro.

   EditConversionOptions     This macro allows you to set text and graphic
                             converter filter options from within Word.

   StartConversionWizard     This macro allows you to convert multiple
                             files of the same file format at the same
                             time.
