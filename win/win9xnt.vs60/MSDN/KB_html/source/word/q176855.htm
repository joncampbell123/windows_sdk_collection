The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you have a table that extends over more than one page, and you specify
several rows of the table as heading rows, none of them will appear on
subsequent pages.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem will occur if you do any of the following:

<UL><LI>Select more than one page of rows as heading rows.

<LI>Copy only the rows designated as heading rows to another part of the
   document or to a new document, and then make the table more than one
   page.

<LI>Create a manual page break or any type of section break within the
   table. (This will split the table into two different tables. This
   functionality is by design of Word.)
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: If You Selected More Than One Page of Rows as Heading Rows</h3>
 
<P>
Make sure that no more than one page of contiguous rows are designated
as heading rows. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the entire table by clicking Select Table on the Table menu.

<P><LI>On the Table menu, be sure Headings is cleared (so that it does not
   have a check mark beside it). If Headings has a check beside it,
   click it to remove the check mark.

<P><LI>Select only the desired heading rows, and on the Table menu, click
   Headings.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: If you Copied the Heading Rows to a Different Location</h3>
 
<P>
When you copy the table headings, include at least one extra row beneath
the rows designated as headings. Once you do this, you may need to follow
the steps in method 1 to completely restore the table heading
functionality.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 3: If Your Table Contains Manual Page Breaks or Section Breaks</h3>
 
<P>
You will need to look for manual page breaks and section breaks that may be
splitting your table and delete them.
<P>
To find and delete a manual page break within the table, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Replace.

<P><LI>If you see More, click it and then place your insertion point into the
   Find What box. Select and delete any entry that may be in that box.

<P><LI>Click Special and click Manual Page Break.
<P>
   NOTE: The characters "^m" (without the quotation marks) will be placed
   in the Find What box.

<P><LI>Click Find Next until you find a page break splitting your table. If you
   find one, click Replace. Click OK on the message that "Word has
   finished searching the document."
<P>
   NOTE: DO NOT click Replace All.
<P>
</OL>To find and delete Section breaks within the table, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Replace.

<P><LI>If you see More, click it and then place the insertion point in the
   Find What box. Select and delete any entry that may be in that box.

<P><LI>Click Special and click Section Break.
<P>
   NOTE: The text "^b" (without the quotation marks) will be placed
   in the Find What box.

<P><LI>Click Find Next until you find a section break splitting your table. If
   you find one, click Replace. Click OK on the message that "Word has
   finished searching the document."
<P>
   NOTE: DO NOT click Replace All.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To be able to designate rows as heading rows in a table, you must select at
least the first row of the table and any rows thereafter have to be
contiguous. You cannot make non-contiguous rows heading rows. One you have
highlighted the rows you want as headings to the table, on the Table menu,
click Headings.
<P>
