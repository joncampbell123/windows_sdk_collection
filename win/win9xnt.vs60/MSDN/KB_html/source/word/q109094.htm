The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you attach a Paradox table that does not contain a key field to your
Word for Windows document, the following Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
error messages occur:
<P>
<PRE>   Can't open unkeyed Paradox table.

</PRE>and then
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to open table: &lt;TableName&gt;.

</PRE>Word then attaches the data source, and you can perform a print merge
operation, but you cannot set filters or perform sorting operations on the
data source.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In Paradox version 3.5, you can designate a field as the key field (this is
similar to the functionality of Microsoft Access). If no key field is
designated in your Paradox table, the above errors occur.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Word for Windows. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Open the database in Paradox version 3.5 and assign a key to one of the
fields in your table.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Key Fields</h3>
 
<P>
Key fields are used to identify records. While they are strictly optional,
a key gives you the following benefits:

<OL><P><LI>Prevents duplicate values in the key field.

<P><LI>Keeps the table sorted according to the values in the field.

<P><LI>Creates a primary index on that field, which can speed queries and other
   operations.
<P>
</OL>You can change fields from keys to non-keys, or vice versa. The only
constraint is that all key fields must be grouped at the beginning of the
table in order of precedence. To change a non-key field to a key field,
move the field to the beginning of the table and add an asterisk (*) after
the field type. Conversely, to change a key field to a non-key field, move
it out of the key field area and erase the asterisk (*). If any existing
records have duplicate values in the new key fields, Paradox places them in
the temporary Keyviol table.
<P>
<P><h3>Keyed Table</h3>
 
<P>
If a table does not contain key fields, its records are kept and displayed
in the order in which they were originally entered. If the table contains
more than one key field, the records are sorted by the primary (first) key
field, then (if necessary) by the secondary (second) key field.
