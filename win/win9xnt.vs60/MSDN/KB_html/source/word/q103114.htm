The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,
   2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start a 16-bit version of Word for Windows in Windows NT, you may
receive the following error message, even though there is plenty of
available memory:
<P>
<PRE>   There is not enough memory to run Word.

</PRE>There are four known situations that can cause this error:

<OL><P><LI>The default printer is unavailable.

<P><LI>There is insufficient disk space in the Word directory.

<P><LI>There is insufficient disk space in the TEMP or startup directory.

<P><LI>If you are running on a network, you do not have Print permission
   for the default printer.
<P>
</OL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Below are instructions for resolving each of the causes listed in the
previous section.
<P>
<P><h3>Default Printer Unavailable</h3>
 
<P>
The printer pointed to by the default printer driver may be unavailable.
Run Print Manager and delete all printers and printer connections. Restart
Word. Alternatively, test the printer connections by printing to each
installed printer from Notepad.
<P>
<P><h3>Insufficient Disk Space in Word Directory</h3>
 
<P>
Word uses the default program directory for some of its internal temporary
files. There should be at least 4 megabytes (MB) of free disk space in this
directory.
<P>
<P><h3>Insufficient Disk Space in TEMP or Startup Directory</h3>
 
<P>
The TEMP environment variable set in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file may be missing
or pointing to a location where there is insufficient disk space to create
Word's temporary files. From the System portion of Control Panel, check
that the User Environment includes a valid TEMP variable. If the Word
startup directory is different from the default, especially if it is in the
same logical drive as the Windows NT paging file, there may be insufficient
disk space to open Word.
<P>
<P><h3>No Print Permission for Default Printer</h3>
 
<P>
To run Word under Windows NT, you must have Print permission with the
default printer. When you start Word, the program queries the printer for
information about its supported fonts, paper sizes, and so forth. If you do
not have permission to print, Word cannot obtain this information, so it
fails to start.
<P>
For permission to print, ask your network administrator to perform the
following steps (NOTE: You cannot change your own permissions unless you
are a Windows NT Administrator or Power User):

<OL><P><LI>Start the Windows NT Print Manager.

<P><LI>Select the window representing the printer so that its window
   appears on top of all other printer windows.

<P><LI>From the Security menu, choose Permissions.

<P><LI>In the Permissions window, check for any entries that specifically
   state "No Access" for the user or for a group that the user belongs
   to. Remove any entries that deny the user access. If an entry
   denies a group the user belongs to, either remove the entry or
   remove the user from that group.

<P><LI>Check to make sure that there is at least one entry that grants the
   user or a group the user belongs to the permission of Print or Full
   Control. If there is no such entry, you must add one.

<P><LI>Choose OK.
<P>
</OL>This change in permissions will take effect immediately.
