The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,
   2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Word for Windows, the Find File command sometimes fails to add search
results to an existing list. This happens if you do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Perform a search operation with Path Only selected in the Drives list
   and Add Matches To List selected in the Options list.

<P><LI>Perform a second search operation and change Path Only to a specific
   drive in the Drives list with Add Matches To List selected in the
   Options list.
<P>
   -or-
<P>
   Perform a second search operation and change Path Only to the same drive
   you chose in step 1 above (after you perform each search, Word changes
   the Drive setting back to Path Only). Change the selection in the Type
   dialog box to search the same drive for a different file type. Make sure
   Add Matches To List is still selected in the Options list.
<P>
</OL>After the second search, Word creates a new list instead of adding to
the previous list. By contrast, Word adds the search results to an
existing list if you choose the Edit Path button to change the search
specifications instead of selecting a different drive from the Drives
list.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the versions of
Microsoft Word for Windows listed above. We are researching this
problem and will post more information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you perform the first search with Path Only selected in the Drives list,
do not select a different drive in this list. Instead, change the search
specifications by choosing the Edit Path button.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Find File.

<P><LI>Choose the Search button. From the Type list, select Word Document
   (*.doc). Notice that "*.doc" appears (without the quotation marks) in
   the File Name box.

<P><LI>From the Drives list, choose drive C and choose the Start Search
   button.

<P><LI>Choose Search again, and make sure Add Matches To List is selected under
   Options.

<P><LI>From the Type list, select Document Template (*.dot). Notice that
   "*.dot" appears (without the quotation marks) in the File Name box.

<P><LI>Choose drive C again from the Drives list and choose the Start
   Search button.
<P>
</OL>Result: The resulting list of found files includes only the Document
Template (*.dot) files, instead of adding the found Document Template
(*.dot) files to the list of found Word Document (*.doc) files. If the
Drives list had not been changed from Path Only, the list of found files
would have contained both sets of files.
