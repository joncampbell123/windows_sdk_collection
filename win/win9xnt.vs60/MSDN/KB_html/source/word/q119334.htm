The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 6.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains questions and answers about menu changes in Microsoft
Word 6.0 for the Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<PRE>   1. Q. In Word 5.1, I have a Font menu, but it's missing in Word 6.0.
          How can I get a Font menu in Word 6.0?

       A. The Word 5.1 Font menu commands are located in the Format
          Character dialog box in Word 6.0. If you want to add a Font
          menu to Word 6.0, use the following procedure:

          1. From the Tools menu, choose Customize.

          2. Click the Menus tab.

          3. Choose the Menu Bar button.

          4. In the Position On Menu Bar box, select F&amp;ormat.

          5. In the Name On Menu Bar box, type "font" (without quotation
             marks).

          6. Choose the Add After button, and then choose the Close
             button. Word returns to the Menus tab of the Tools Customize
             dialog box.

          7. In the Categories box, select Fonts.

          8. Choose the Add All button.

             -or-

             In the Fonts box, select the font you want to appear on your
             Font menu and then choose the Add button. Repeat this step
             until you have added all the fonts you want on your Font
             menu.

          9. Choose the Close button.

   2. Q. On the Format menu in Word 6.0, the Document, Section, and
          Character commands are missing. Where do I find these commands?

       A. The former Document and Section commands have been combined
          into a single Word 6.0 command called Document Layout, which is
          located on the File menu. The former Character command is now
          called the Font command and is located on the Format menu. For
          more information about the changes in Word 6.0, see Chapter 2,
          "What's New in Word 6.0?" in the "Microsoft Word Quick Results"
          guide. For online information, double-click the Help button on
          the Standard toolbar and then type "new features" (without
          quotation marks).

   3. Q. In Word 6.0, the Envelope button no longer appears on any of my
          toolbars. How can I add it?

       A. To add a button to a toolbar, you must first display that
          toolbar using the Toolbars command on the View menu. Then use
          the following procedure to add the Create Envelope button to
          one of your toolbars:

          1. From the Tools menu, choose Customize.

          2. Click the Toolbars tab.

          3. In the Categories list, select Tools.

          4. Under Buttons, click the Create Envelope Button and drag it
             to the position on the toolbar where you want to add the
             button.

          5. Choose the Close button.

   4. Q. When I press the NUM LOCK or CLEAR key on my numeric keypad,
          Word does not toggle the numeric keypad on and off. Why not?

       A. In Word 6.0, the functionality of the NUM LOCK or CLEAR key has
          been changed to make it consistent with other applications and
          computer systems. When you press only that key, you are
          pressing CLEAR, which deletes characters to the right of the
          insertion point. To use the key to toggle the numeric keypad on
          and off, press SHIFT+NUM LOCK. For more information, double-
          click the Help button on the Standard toolbar and then type "num
          lock" (without quotation marks).

   5. Q. In Word 6.0, I want to use the glossary entries I created in
          Word 5.x, but I can't find them. Where are they?

       A. In Word 6.0, glossaries are now called AutoText. To use
          glossary entries you created in an earlier version of Word, be
          sure to preserve your existing glossary files, such as the
          Standard Glossary, when you install Word 6.0. To convert your
          glossary entries from an earlier version of Word to AutoText
          entries, simply open the old glossary files in Word 6.0. Word
          6.0 stores the new AutoText entries in the template attached to
          the active document--usually the Normal template. For
          information about converting glossary entries from an earlier
          version of Word for the Macintosh, double-click the Help button
          on the Standard toolbar and then type "glossary" (without
          quotation marks).

   6. Q. Where is my Work menu from Word 5.x for the Macintosh, and how
          can I get it back?

       A. You can customize Word 6.0 much more extensively than earlier
          versions of Word for the Macintosh. As a result, you can add
          items to any menu--not just a Work menu. Nonetheless, if you
          want to use your Word 5.x Work menu in Word 6.0, you must first
          open your Word Settings (5) and Standard Glossary files in Word
          6.0. After you open both files and merge their contents into
          your Normal Document Template, the Work menu will appear in
          Word 6.0.

          To add your Word 5.x Work menu to Word 6.0, use the following
          procedure:

          1. In Word 6.0, choose Open from the File menu.

          2. Select your Word Settings (5) file, located in the
             Preferences subfolder of the System folder, and choose OK.

          3. When Word displays the message "Would you prefer to merge
             the settings and styles...," choose the Merge To Current
             button.

             NOTE: Word merges only the custom glossary entries from your
             Word Settings (5) file. Word does not merge the built-in
             glossary entries, such as Date and Time, because Word 6.0
             includes fields for these operations.

          4. From the File menu, choose Open.

          5. Select your Standard Glossary (or other user-defined
             glossary), located in the Word 5.x program folder, and then
             choose OK.

          6. Choose OK when Word displays the "...user-defined glossary
             entries..." message. The Work menu should now appear in Word
             6.0.
