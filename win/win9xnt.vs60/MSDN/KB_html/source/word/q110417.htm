</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Setup may install the Word for Windows shared applications (namely
Microsoft WordArt, Microsoft Equation Editor, Microsoft Graph, and the text
and graphics converters, collectively known as MSAPPS) on a network server
instead of your local hard drive.
<P>
Note: The default location of the shared applications is the
&lt;WINDOWS&gt;\MSAPPS subdirectory.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Prior to installing Word, if you performed a workstation installation of an
application (such as Microsoft Publisher or Microsoft Excel) that placed
shared applications on a network server or shared drive, your WIN.INI and
REG.DAT files point to the network location of those shared applications.
By design, when you install Word, Setup searches for an existing shared
applications location and installs its shared applications in that
location. This decision is based on the (usually valid) assumption that you
want to keep all your shared applications together in the same location.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you want Word Setup to place your shared applications in a different
location, do one of the following:

<OL><P><LI>Use the Setup program from the other application to uninstall the
   shared applications from their network server location. Then run
   Word Setup to install these applications locally.
<P>
   -or-

<P><LI>Remove all the references to those applications from your WIN.INI
   and REG.DAT files before you run Setup.
<P>
   Use Registration Information Editor (REGEDIT.EXE) to modify your REG.DAT
   file; use System Configuration Editor (SYSEDIT.EXE) or any text editor
   to modify your WIN.INI file. To start REGEDIT.EXE or SYSEDIT.EXE, use
   the Run command on the File menu in Windows Program Manager.
<P>
</OL>Note: With either of these workarounds, the shared applications always run
from the location where Word installed them, even when you start them from
another application. You can no longer start these shared applications from
their original network server location. For example, if you start a
workstation installation of Microsoft Publisher (which installed Microsoft
WordArt on the server), and then start WordArt, WordArt runs from the hard
drive location--where Word installed it--instead of the server location.
