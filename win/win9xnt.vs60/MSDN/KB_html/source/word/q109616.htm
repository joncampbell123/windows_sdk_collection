<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains instructions for exporting a drawing in EPS format
from Autodesk Corporation's AutoCAD Revision 12 for MS-DOS and Windows.
AutoCAD currently has two different plotter configurations that allow you
to export in EPS format, and its own export feature.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Configure for Exporting</h3>
 
<P>
AutoCAD allows you to configure both plotting and printing devices. If you
have not done so, configure the PostScript device as follows:

<OL><P><LI>From the AutoCAD main menu, choose option 5 (Configure AutoCAD).

<P><LI>From the Configure menu, choose option 5(Configure Plotter).

<P><LI>Select option 20 (if in MS-DOS) or 12 (if in Windows) for a PostScript
   Device ADI 4.2, or select option 21 (if in MS-DOS) or 13 (if in Windows)
   for Raster File Format.
<P>
   a. If you selected option 20 in MS-DOS or 12 in Windows, complete the
<P><PRE>      configuration as follows:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      1) Select option 1 for 300 DPI Resolution.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      2) Select N for No Color Output. If you are printing to a color
<PRE></PRE>         device, select Y.

      3) Select N to exclude the ^z character at the end of the file. Some
         drawing files, however, will need the ^z character to control line
         thickness. If your drawing imports and lines are blending
         together, reconfigure your plotting device to include this
         character.

      4) Select S for Serial port unless there is actually a device
         connected to your machine; if there is a device connected, select
         the correct port.

      5) Select N to keep your current port settings.

      6) Select N to keep the configuration you just created.

      7) Enter a meaningful description of the device you have just
         configured--for example, "EPS Printer\Plotter" (without the
         quotation marks).

   b. If you selected option 21 in MS-DOS or 13 in Windows, complete the
      configuration as follows:

      1) Select 5 for a 640 x 480 VGA Resolution.

      2) Select option 9 for PostScript Image.

      3) Select option 1 for Monochrome Image. If you select option 2 for
         Full Color, the image will import correctly and print, but it will
         generate a offending "Command = color image" error message on the
         printer and will not print the rest of your document.

      4) Select 0 for Auto Sizing.

      5) Options 1 through 3 are all valid options; it is recommended that
         you choose option 1.

      6) For best results you should select the background color to match
         the color of your workspace in AutoCAD. 0 has produced the best
         results to date.

      7) Select N to accept the current settings.

      8) Enter a meaningful description of the device you have just
         configured--for example, "EPS Printer\Plotter" (without the
         quotation marks).

</PRE></OL><h3>Steps to Export</h3>
 
<P>
After you have configured the AutoCAD EPS plotter interface, you can export
the appropriate graphics in one of the following ways:

<OL><P><LI>Plot to file.
<P>
   Plotting to a file can be initiated for the currently viewed image by
   entering the PLOT command from the AutoCAD Drawing Editor. If you would
   like to plot to a file instead of a plotting device, you must select the
   Plot To File check box. The currently viewed drawing name and a default
   extension of .PLT will be used. You can modify the filename and
   extension by selecting the filename button and entering a new name.

<P><LI>AutoCAD's export feature.
<P>
   a. From the File menu, choose Import/Export.
<P>
   b. From the Import/Export menu, choose PostScript Out.
<P>
   c. In the File Dialog box, type a filename.
<P>
   d. At the What To Plot prompt, type "Window" (without the quotation
<P><PRE>      marks).
</PRE><P>
   e. When prompted to enter the first and other corners for the window to
<P><PRE>      plot, use your pointing device to place the cross hairs in the upper-
      left corner of your drawing; press ENTER. Place the cross hairs in
      the lower-right corner of your drawing and press ENTER. This will
      define the drawing object to be written to the EPS file.
</PRE><P>
   f. Type "TIFF" (without the quotation marks) if you would like to have a
<P><PRE>      preview image included with your EPS, or type "NONE" (without the
      quotation marks) to not have one included.
</PRE><P>
   g. For the preview image size, select one of the following: 128, 256, or
<P><PRE>      512.
</PRE><P>
   h. For Size units, select Inches.
<P>
   i. For the scaling, select Fit.
<P>
   j. For the size 7.5x10.5, select USER.
<P>
<P>
</OL>Your AutoCAD image is now ready to be inserted into a Word for Windows
document by using the Picture command from the Insert menu, assuming the
graphics filter EPSIMP.FLT has been properly installed.
