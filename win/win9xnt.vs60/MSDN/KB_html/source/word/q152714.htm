The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Power Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.1a
<LI>Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, version 4.2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to start the Power Macintosh version of Word after you start
your computer from the System CD or Disk Tools disk, one of the following
occurs:
<P>
<PRE>   Word starts up, and then quits suddenly before the splash screen
   appears. You do not receive an error message. More specifically, the
   animated rectangles (commonly referred to as "zoom rects") zoom outward
   and then zoom immediately back in.

    -or-

   One of the following error messages appears:

      The application "Microsoft Word" could not be opened because
      "Microsoft_OLE2" could not be found.

      The application "Microsoft Word" could not be opened because
      "MicrosoftDialogLib" could not be found.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1: The OLE Files are Missing from the Path</h3>
 
<P>
When Word for the Power Macintosh starts, it looks for OLE files in the
Extensions folder of the active System Folder. Because the computer is no
longer started from the same System that Word was installed to, these files
are missing and Word cannot start.
<P>
This situation does not apply if you are trying to run the 68K version of
Word because OLE is not required to start Word.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 2: Your Computer Does Not Have Enough Memory to Start Word</h3>
 
<P>
On Power Macintosh computers with only 8 megabytes (MB) of memory, virtual
memory is required in order to run Word. Because the Memory Control Panel
is not present in the System Folder of the Macintosh System CD, Word does
not start.
<P>
In the new memory model, Power Macintosh-optimized programs such as
Word take up more memory when virtual memory is disabled. This behavior
occurs because, when virtual memory is active, the system loads some
components that it normally loads only on demand.
<P>
NOTE: On a Power Macintosh with only 8 MB of memory, because running Word
while booted off the System CD is not possible, it is recommended that a
clean system installation be done for testing purposes. This can be
accomplished by pressing COMMAND+SHIFT+K in the System 7.5 Installation
dialog box and clicking "Install New System Folder" in the dialog
box that is displayed.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article(s) in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : How to Do a Clean Installation of System 7.5

</PRE><h3>Case 3: System Resources Are Inadequate</h3>
 
<P>
Word for the Power Macintosh will not run from a Disk Tools disk, no matter
how much built-in memory is available. This is because the System File on
the Disk Tools disk has a minimum set of resources; the ones necessary to
run the Power Macintosh version of Word are often absent.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To troubleshoot for a damaged system for Word for the Power Macintosh,
follow these steps.

<OL><P><LI>Copy the following required OLE files from the Extensions Folder to the
   application folder (the folder containing the Word icon).
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Dialog Library
    - Microsoft OLE Library
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: Because Word also searches the application folder, this will
   place these files in the search path so that Word will be able to start
   even when a different System is active. Once you are finished
   troubleshooting, delete the extra OLE files from the application folder
   so that the files don't take up extra space and don't interfere with the
   normal search path.

<P><LI>Start the Power Macintosh using the Macintosh System CD:
<P>
   - If you have System CD version 1.0:
<P>
<PRE>        Insert the CD at startup.

   - If you have System CD version 2.0:

        With the CD inserted in the drive, start the computer while 
        pressing C on the keyboard.

   NOTE: An alternate method of restarting with any Macintosh System
   compact disc is to place the CD in the CD-ROM drive, choose Restart from
   the Special menu, and press and hold COMMAND+OPTION+SHIFT+DEL while the
   computer restarts. If you use this keystroke, let go of the keys when
   the happy Macintosh icon appears, otherwise the hard disk will not start
   and you will need to restart the computer.

</PRE><P><LI>Start Microsoft Word.
<P>
</OL>If the problem persists after starting the computer this way, you can
conclude that something is wrong with Word and not with the System or
Finder file on the hard disk. In this case, you should remove and re-
install Word.
<P>
If Word behaves normally, you can conclude that the System or Finder file
on the hard disk is damaged. In this case, you must reinstall your
Macintosh system software. For assistance, check your Apple Macintosh
manual, or contact Apple technical support. (NOTE: It's always a good idea
to back up your hard disk before you reinstall the Macintosh system
software.)
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are testing a feature that requires OLE functionality (such as
embedding an Equation Editor object, linking to a Microsoft Excel
worksheet, and so on), you may need to copy all of the OLE files to the
application folder. The following OLE files are installed with Word 6.0:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Dialog Library
<LI>Microsoft OLE Extension
<LI>Microsoft OLE Library
<P>
</UL>There may be other OLE files that have been installed by other Office
programs.
<P>
Restarting with a System on an alternate source is a common method for
troubleshooting Word problems.
