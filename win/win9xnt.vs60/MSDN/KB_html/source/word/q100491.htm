<P>
<PRE>   Macro Name             Description
   ----------             -----------

   Ansi Char              Displays the ANSI character codes for the
                          characters within a selection.  Also allows
                          you to print or display a list in a new
                          document of the codes within a selection.

   App Runner             Brings up a dialog box that allows you to start
                          commonly used applications, such as File Manager,
                          Sysedit, Print Manager, and Control Panel.

   Bookmark Helper        Helps you manage bookmarks in your documents.
                          You can list the contents of all bookmarks in
                          a document or you can search for a bookmark
                          name or its contents.

   Print Listed Documents The FileNext macro chains documents together
                          for group printing (be sure to supply the full
                          paths to the document files). The FilePrintNext
                          macro prints documents that have been chained
                          together using the FileNext macro.

   Glossary Manager       Copies or moves selected glossary entries from
                          one template to another. You can also use
                          Glossary Manager to list selected glossary
                          entries in a new Word document or export them
                          to a text file.

   Org Chart              Generates an organizational chart using the
                          outline of the current document.

   Print Ranges           Prints odd and/or even pages and noncontiguous
                          ranges of pages.

   Save Screen Size &amp;
   Position (two macros)  AutoExit runs when you exit Word and saves the
                          current size and position of the screen.
                          AutoExec runs when you start Word and restores
                          the size and position of the screen saved by
                          AutoExit.

   Search Header/Footer   Searches for and replaces text in your document
                          headers and footers.

   Table Math             Multiplies, adds, subtracts, divides, and
                          averages values in a Word table.

   True Super/Subscript   Applies superscript or subscript formatting to
                          selected text. The position and size of
                          superscript and subscript text is relative to
                          the position and size of the text before you
                          ran the macro.

   Concordance Index      Automatically searches through a document for
                          a specified word and marks each occurrence of
                          the word as an index entry.

   Concordance Index List Searches through a document for a list of
                          words and marks each occurrence of each word
                          as an index entry. The list of words is stored
                          in a separate document that you create before
                          you run the Concordance Index List macro.
