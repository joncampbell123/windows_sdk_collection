The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 5.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Word, text in a header or a footer may disappear or change after the
file is saved, closed, and reopened. This problem is related to Word's
Fast Save option, and it occurs when a file is fast saved for the
first time after a regular save.
<P>
Text in the last section of a document may disappear from all headers
and footers, including the first, even, and odd headers and footers.
In a single section document, the headers and footers will be left
blank. In multiple section documents, the last section's headers and
footers will take on the text of the corresponding preceding headers
and footers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A patcher program is available that will correct this problem. When
run, the patcher program changes the product version to 5.1a and the
date to November 4, 1992. The patch is offered free of charge to
Microsoft Word 5.1 users and may be ordered by calling Microsoft
Sales Information Center at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
The patch is also available as an application note ("MW0711: Word 5.1a
Patcher"). For information about obtaining this application note,
query on "MW0711" in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.
<P>
To prevent the problem from occurring before the patcher is run, turn
the Fast Save option off:

<OL><P><LI>From the Tools menu, select Preferences.

<P><LI>In the Preferences box, select the Open And Save category.

<P><LI>Clear the Fast Save check box.
<P>
</OL>If the problem has already occurred, running the patcher program or
turning Fast Save off will not restore the headers and footers. They
will have to be retyped.
