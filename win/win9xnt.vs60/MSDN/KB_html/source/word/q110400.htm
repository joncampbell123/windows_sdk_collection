<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you are grammar checking a sentence that contains a word the grammar
checker suggests you delete, you can choose the Delete button to delete the
highlighted word. If instead, you manually edit the sentence in the
Sentence box, the Delete button in the dialog does not change back to a
Change button as expected. Instead, the Delete button functions as the
Change option.
<P>
For example, the grammar checker will suggest in the following sentence
that the sentence is too wordy and that you should consider deleting the
word "as" to correct the problem:
<P>
<PRE>   I consider you as my most interesting friend.

</PRE>If instead of choosing the Delete button, you manually delete the word "as"
in the Sentence box, the Delete button remains available.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
