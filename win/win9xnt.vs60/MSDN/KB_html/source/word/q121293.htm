The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft WordBasic commands that are specific to Microsoft Word 6.x for 
the Macintosh are deleted from a macro when you edit and save the macro in 
Word 6.0 or 6.0a for Windows.
<P>
Word 6.0c does not delete unknown commands from your macros when you edit
them in Word 6.0c for Windows. Instead of deleting the Macintosh-specific
command, Word 6.0c replaces Macintosh commands with an 
"Unrecognized_Command" string or token.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you create a macro on the Macintosh platform and copy the template that
contains the macro to Word 6.0 or 6.0a for Windows, the Macintosh-specific
WordBasic commands are permanently removed from the macro if you edit and
save the macro in Word 6.0 or 6.0a for Windows. The Macintosh commands are
not restored when you transfer the macro back to the Macintosh platform. As
a result, the macro does not run correctly when transferred back to the
Macintosh platform.
<P>
If the macro is transferred to Word 6.0c for Windows, the Macintosh-
specific commands are not deleted. Word 6.0c will display
"Unrecognized_Statement" in place of the Macintosh commands. The Macintosh
WordBasic commands are not deleted when you edit and save the macro in Word
6.0c for Windows.
<P>

</PRE>Editing and Saving the Macro in Word for Windows 6.0, 6.0a:
<P>
The following Macintosh Word 6.0 sample macro contains a Macintosh-specific
function named MacID$.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub MAIN
      a$ = MacID$("TEXT")
   End Sub.

</PRE>If you open, edit, and save changes to the above cross-platform macro in
Word 6.0 or 6.0a for Windows, the macro appears as shown below when re-
opened in Word 6.0 for the Macintosh:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub MAIN
      a$ = ("TEXT")
   End Sub

</PRE>NOTE: The Macintosh-specific command, MacID$, was deleted.
<P>
Editing and Saving the Macro in Word for Windows 6.0c:
<P>
If you create the following macro in Word 6.0 for the Macintosh
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Main
      a$ = MacID$("TEXT")
   End Sub

</PRE>and open the template that contains the macro in Word 6.0c for Windows, the
macro appears as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Main
      a$ = Unrecognized_Statement33134("TEXT")
   End Sub

</PRE>The "33134" number is the token identification number for the "MacID$"
command. Word 6.0c for Windows does not delete any unrecognized Macintosh
WordBasic commands.
<P>
NOTE: If you transfer the template that contains the macro back to
Macintosh Word 6.0, you must "dirty" the macro in Word for the Macintosh.
In other words, you must open the macro in Macintosh Word, make a small
change such as adding a space, and save the macro. This action changes the
token IDs back to the Macintosh-specific WordBasic commands, such as
MacID$(). "Dirtying" the macro in Macintosh Word (that is, editing and
saving the macro in Macintosh Word) is necessary only once. Ideally, you
should dirty the macro once before distributing the macro to other
Macintosh Word users.
