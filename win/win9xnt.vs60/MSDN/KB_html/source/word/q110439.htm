The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The last digit (on the right side of the cell) may be truncated when you
print a table to a PCL (non-PostScript) printer from Word for Windows.
<P>
For example, "5678" prints as "567" (the 8 does not print).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if:

<UL><LI>The Space Between Columns is set to 0, and the cell text is right
   justified.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Numbers are pushed to the right edge of the table cell using a
   decimal tab.
<P>
</UL>This problem occurs when you print a document based on the INVOICE.DOT
template, which is supplied with Word. In the Invoice # and Date fields,
the last character does not print.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word version 6.0
for Windows. This problem was corrected in the version of INVOICE.DOT that
is included with the Word 6.0a disk set. This correction is not included on
the Word 6.0a Patch disk.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
In table cells where you apply right alignment paragraph formatting, choose
Paragraph from the Format menu, change the Right Indentation paragraph
setting to .05 inch, and then choose OK.
<P>
If the Space Between Columns is set to 0 and the cell text is right
justified, use the following instructions to change the Space Between
Columns setting to at least .01" (inch):

<OL><P><LI>Select the table.

<P><LI>From the Table menu, choose Cell Height And Width.

<P><LI>Select the Column tab.

<P><LI>In the Space Between Columns box, type ".01 in" (without the quotation
   marks) and choose OK.
<P>
   NOTE: You may need to increase this value to .03 inch in some
   situations.
<P>
   This causes the table to be adjusted by .01 inch. The visible
   differences should be very minor.

<P><LI>Print the document again. It should print correctly.
<P>
</OL>If numbers are pushed to the right edge of the table cell using a decimal
tab, increase the column width slightly using the following procedure:

<OL><P><LI>Position the insertion point in the column that contains the truncated
   digit.

<P><LI>From the Table menu, choose Select Column.

<P><LI>From the Table menu, choose Cell Height And Width.

<P><LI>Select the Column tab.

<P><LI>Increase the column width. About .1-inch increase per cut-off digit
   is a good starting estimate.
<P>
   The table will adjust slightly, but the difference should be very
   minor.

<P><LI>Print the document again. It should print correctly.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem does not occur with the same settings when you print to a
PostScript printer.
