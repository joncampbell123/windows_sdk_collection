<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you prepare documents for a direct (or bulk) mailing, you may need
to get a Coding Accuracy Support System (CASS) certified number in order to 
receive a bar code discount.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A CASS certification service or program confirms an address list
against the post office's address list and ensures that the addresses
contain proper address locations. The certification service or program
then produces a 3553 form; the customer submits the 3553 form to the
post office when he or she does a bulk mailing. Once the bulk mailing
list is CASS certified, the customer may receive a discount on the bulk
mailing postage. This discount applies to quantities of 200 or more
addresses.
<P>
To get an address list CASS coded, do any of the following:

<UL><LI>Call the National Customer Support Center (NCSC) at (800) 238-3150.
   NCSC will do a one-time-only CASS coding of up to 50,000 address
   records at no charge. The process generally takes three to four
   weeks.

<LI>Call the NCSC at (800) 238-3150 and ask for a CASS Certified Vendor
   List. Use one of the vendors to get the address list CASS coded.
   (This service is not free. Each vendor has its own price.)

<LI>Buy one of the CASS Certified Address Matching Programs (available
   in the vendor list mentioned in the previos option) and a subscription 
   to the U.S. Postal Service's ZIP+4 database (also handled by the NCSC), 
   and CASS code the list that way. This option requires a CD-ROM drive.
<P>
</UL>With any of these methods, you will be given (or the address-matching
software will produce) a Postal Form 3553. You must present this form
to your local post office each time you do a bulk mailing to receive
the bulk mailing discount.
<P>
<P><h3>How Does Microsfot Word Fit in to This Process?</h3>
 
<P>
Once you have gotten the address list CASS coded, you can run the list
through Word's mail merge feature to generate the bar coded envelopes
you need for an additional bar code postage discount. The only
discounts now available are for the 11-digit or delivery point bar
code, which Word generates using ZIP+4 ZIP Codes. This discount applies
only to letter-size mail. You can obtain additional discounts by
sorting the address according to the local "Manager or Rates and
Classifications" specifications. Contact your local post office and ask
for these specification to get the latest information about postal
rates.
<P>
NOTE: The NCSC does not have any information on rates. To obtain postal
rate information, you must contact the local post office and ask for
the "Manager of Rates and Classifications."
