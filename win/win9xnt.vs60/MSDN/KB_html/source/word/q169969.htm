</PRE>INSTALLING MICROSOFT WORD 97
<P>
<P><h3>IMPORTANT: Disable Virus Protection Before Running Setup</h3>
 
<P>
Some virus protection programs, such as VSafe.com and Norton Anti-Virus
Autoprotect, can interfere with the Microsoft Word 97 Setup program. If you
use a virus protection program on your computer, please disable it before
running Setup. (You can re-enable the virus protection program after Setup
is complete.) Note: If your virus-detection program starts automatically
when you start Windows, you can disable it by restarting Windows while
holding down the SHIFT key.
<P>
<P><h3>Minimum System Requirements for Microsoft Word 97</h3>
 
<P>
To use the Alpha system version of Microsoft Word 97, you need:

<UL><LI>Alpha computer with a 21064 or higher microprocessor
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0, Service Pack 3 or later
<LI>32 MB memory
<LI>47-107 MB of available hard disk space required; 74 MB required for
   typical installation, depending on configuration.
   (Note: 70-175 MB of available hard disk space required for combined
   installation of Microsoft Excel 97 and Word 97; 106 MB required for
   typical installation, depending on configuration.)
<LI>CD-ROM drive
<LI>VGA or higher-resolution video adapter (Super VGA, 256-color
   recommended)
<LI>Microsoft Mouse, Microsoft IntelliMouse, or compatible pointing device
   (Microsoft IntelliMouse required for extended navigational capabilities)
<P>
</UL>Additional items or services required to use certain features:

<UL><LI>9600 or higher-baud modem (14,400 baud recommended).
<LI>Some Internet functionality may require Internet access and payment of a
   separate fee to a service provider.
<P>
</UL><h3>Installation Instructions</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Quit all programs if any are running.

<P><LI>Insert the Microsoft Excel 97 and Microsoft Word 97 CD-ROM into your
   CD-ROM drive.

<P><LI>Click Run on the Start menu, and type the following (assuming your
   CD-ROM drive is drive D):
<P>
<P><PRE>      D:\word\setup.exe
</PRE><P>
</OL>Using Punctuation Characters in Directory Names May Cause Problems
 
<P>
If the name of the directory you install Microsoft Excel 97 or Microsoft
Word 97 into includes a comma (,), single quotation mark ('), or
exclamation point (!), you may have problems when you use the programs. To
avoid problems, use the default directory or use only letters and numbers
in directory names.
<P>
MICROSOFT WORD 97 HELP AND GETTING RESULTS BOOK
<P>
<P><h3>Help Topics Graphics Don't Print Clearly</h3>
 
<P>
When you print a Help topic that contains a graphic, the graphic may not
print clearly. In particular, this occurs when you print a topic with
grayscale colors using a printer driver that does not have options to
control dithering.
<P>
<P><h3>Correction to Getting Results Book</h3>
 
<P>
On page 218, "Click Scrolling Text (Format menu)." should be "Click
Scrolling Text (Insert menu)."
<P>
WORKING WITH DOCUMENTS
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot Edit a Word Document Embedded Object in Word 95</h3>
 
<P>
When you insert a Word document as an embedded object in a document in Word
97, save the document in the Word 6.0/95 format or Rich Text Format, and
then open the document in Word 95, you may receive the error message "Word
cannot edit the object" when you double-click the object to edit it. This
occurs because when you save the document created in Word 97 in the Word
6.0/95 format or Rich Text Format, the embedded object is not saved as a
Word 95 document object. To edit the object, you must have Word 97
installed on your computer.
<P>
Cannot Edit an Embedded Object Created in a Word 95 Document After Saving
in Word 97
 
<P>
If you create an embedded object in a Word 95 document, open the document
in Word 97, and then save the document in Word 6.0/95 format or Rich Text
Format, the embedded object is updated to a later version of the OLE object
server program on the computer running Word 97. If you reopen the document
in Word 95 on a computer that does not have Word 97 installed, you may not
be able to edit the object.
<P>
This can occur with any OLE object, including objects created in Word 97
documents. To see a list of OLE server programs installed on your computer,
view the list in the Object dialog box (Insert Menu).
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot Undo Edit After Attaching a Template</h3>
 
<P>
When you attach a different template to the active document, the Undo
command (Edit menu) is not available. This may occur after running a wizard
that attaches a template to the active document.
<P>
<P><h3>Issues When Running FX!32</h3>
 
<P>
If you are running FX!32, you may encounter problems loading some Visual
Basic for Applications (VBA) templates, add-in programs, or macros. You can
correct these problems by performing one of the following:

<UL><LI>Add Winword.exe and Excel.exe to the list of programs that FX!32
   ignores. See FX!32 online help for further instructions.

<LI>Copy the file Vba332.dll from your \Program Files\Microsoft
   Office\Shared folder, and paste the new copy in your \System32 folder.

<LI>Refer to your FX!32 Version 1.2 or later readme.txt file for more
   information.
<P>
</UL><h3>Problems With Filters not Being Upgraded for Word 97</h3>
 
<P>
Some image filters have not been upgraded since Word 6.0 for Windows NT for
Alpha. These image filters include the CGM import filter (Cgmimp32.flt),
the DRW import filter (Drwimp32.flt), the DXF import filter (Dxfimp32.flt),
and the WPG export filter (Wpgexp32.flt). When using these filters, some
files may not show a preview of the image or look correct in Word. If you
are experiencing problems with these filters and would like more
information about them, search for "graphics file formats" in Help.
<P>
MICROSOFT WORD 97 VALUPACK
<P>
Microsoft Word 97 ValuPack Setup May Not Be Successful Without
Administrative Permissions
 
<P>
If you use Windows NT Workstation 4.0 you must be a member of the
Administrators group to install some components of the Word 97 ValuPack.
<P>
<P><h3>Installation of Word 97 Import Converter for Word 6.0 for Alpha/NT</h3>
 
<P>
This converter enables Word 6.0 users to read documents created in Word 97.

<P>
This section lists workarounds for printer driver and other printing
problems.
<P>

MICROSOFT VISUAL BASIC FOR APPLICATIONS
<P>
<P><h3>Changes to Code Examples</h3>
 
<P>
Code examples in Microsoft Word Visual Basic Help (VbaWrd8.hlp) should be
changed as follows.
<P>
ExitWindows method example -- change the first line to:
<P>
<PRE>   Documents.Save NoPrompt:=True,
   OriginalFormat:=wdOriginalDocumentFormat

</PRE>OutsideLineWidth property example -- change fourth line in the
first example to:
<P>
<PRE>   OutsideLineWidth = wdLineWidth075pt

</PRE>SnapToShapes property example -- change the first example to:
<P>
<PRE>   Options.SnapToShapes = True

</PRE>DefaultBorderColorIndex Property Example -- change the example to
read:
<P>
<PRE>   ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(1).Borders.Enable = True
   With Options
       .DefaultBorderColorIndex = wdRed
       .DefaultBorderLineStyle = wdLineStyleDouble
   End With

</PRE>Hyperlinks property example -- change the second line of the
third example to:
<P>
<PRE>   If InStr(LCase(aHyperlink.Address), "microsoft") &lt;&gt; 0 Then

</PRE>MailMergeDataFields Collection object -- change the first line in
the second example in the topic to:
<P>
<PRE>   If ActiveDocument.MailMerge.DataSource.Type = wdMergeInfoFromWord
   Then

</PRE>MailMergeFieldNames Collection object -- change the first line in
the second example in the topic to:
<P>
<PRE>   If ActiveDocument.MailMerge.DataSource.Type = wdMergeInfoFromWord
   Then

</PRE>SpellingSuggestion object -- change the second line in the first
example in the topic to:
<P>
<PRE>   MsgBox
   ActiveDocument.Words(1).GetSpellingSuggestions.Item(1).Name

</PRE>RevisedPropertiesMark property example -- change second example to:
<P>
<PRE>   temp = Options.RevisedPropertiesMark

</PRE>Dictionary object -- change the first line of the last example in
the topic to:
<P>
<PRE>   Set myspell = Languages(wdEnglishUS).ActiveSpellingDictionary

</PRE>Uniform property example -- change the third line in the first
example to:
<P>
<PRE>   myTable.Cell(3, 3).Split 1,2

</PRE>Indexes property example -- the second example is not valid and
will not work.
<P>
ChapterPageSeparator property example and HeadingLevelForChapter
property example -- change both examples to read:
<P>
<PRE>   Documents.Add
   For i = 1 To 5
      With Selection
         .TypeParagraph
         .InsertBreak
      End With
   Next i
   ActiveDocument.Content.Style = wdStyleHeading1
   ActiveDocument.Content.ListFormat.ApplyListTemplate _

   ListTemplate:=ListGalleries(wdOutlineNumberGallery).ListTemplates (7)

   Set myHead = ActiveDocument.Sections(1).Headers(wdHeaderFooterPrimary)
   With myHead.PageNumbers
     .Add PageNumberAlignment:=wdAlignPageNumberCenter
    .NumberStyle = wdPageNumberStyleArabic
    .IncludeChapterNumber = True
    .HeadingLevelForChapter = 0
    .ChapterPageSeparator = wdSeparatorEnDash
</PRE>End With
<P>
SaveAs method -- third example should be replaced with:
<P>
This example retrieves the SaveFormat property value for the WordPerfect
5.x for Windows converter, and then it uses this value with the SaveAs
method.
<P>
<PRE>   For Each cnv In Application.FileConverters
    If cnv.ClassName = "WrdPrfctWin" Then
        ActiveDocument.SaveAs FileName:="MyWP.doc",
   FileFormat:=cnv.SaveFormat
    End If
   Next cnv

</PRE>Points property example and SetPosition method -- example should
be changed to:
<P>
<PRE>   Set myDocument = ActiveDocument
   With myDocument.Shapes(3).Nodes
    pointsArray = .Item(2).Points
    currXvalue = pointsArray(1, 1)
    currYvalue = pointsArray(1, 2)
    .SetPosition 2, currXvalue + 200, currYvalue + 300
   End With

</PRE><h3>InsertSymbol Method Has a Fourth Argument</h3>
 
<P>
The InsertSymbol method has the following fourth argument, Bias Optional
Variant. Sets the font bias for symbols. This argument is useful for
setting the correct font bias for characters in Far East versions of Word.
Can be one of the following WdFontBias constants:
<P>
<PRE>   wdFontBiasDefault, wdFontBiasDontCare, or wdFontBiasFareast.

</PRE><h3>RevisedLinesColor Property</h3>
 
<P>
The RevisedLinesColor property has a constant that is not valid:
<P>
<PRE>   wdByAuthor.

</PRE><h3>Reload Method Not Available</h3>
 
<P>
When you use the Reload method in a Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications
macro in Microsoft Word 97, the macro may start to run before the reload is
completed. You may want to avoid using the Reload method in Word.
<P>
<P><h3>MsgBox Function</h3>
 
<P>
In addition to the constants listed for the MsgBox function, the following
constants are available for use as button argument settings.
<P>
<PRE>   Constant            Value               Description

   vbHelp              16384 (&amp;H4000)      Adds a Help button to
                                           the message box. Click
                                           the Help button or press
                                           F1 to generate a Help
                                           event.

   vbSetForeground     65536 (&amp;H10000)     Places the message box
                                           in the foreground and
                                           activates it. Keyboard
                                           input is directed to the
                                           message box.

                                           reading order.

</PRE><h3>ReSize Event</h3>
 
<P>
The syntax and remarks for the Resize event should read as follows:
<P>
Syntax: Private Sub UserForm_Resize()
<P>
Remarks: Use a Resize event procedure to move or resize controls when the
parent UserForm is resized. You can also use this event procedure to
recalculate variables or properties.
<P>
Note: UserForm controls have no Resize event.
<P>
MICROSOFT FORMS 2.0: ISSUES AND DOCUMENTATION CHANGES
<P>
The following sections describe changes to the documentation for Microsoft
Forms 2.0. These changes supercede the contents of the Help file Fm20.hlp.
These sections also contain known issues with Microsoft Forms 2.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Methods</h3>
 
<P>
Repaint Method: The Repaint method does not return a value. The correct
syntax is:
<P>
<PRE>   Object.Repaint

</PRE><h3>Controls</h3>
 

<UL><LI>CheckBox Control: The initial value of a CheckBox control is False.

<LI>The GroupName property can be used with one or more CheckBox controls.
   Note, however, that the CheckBox controls in a group still operate
   independently of one another.

<LI>OptionButton Control: The initial value of an OptionButton control is
   False.

<LI>ToggleButton Control: The initial value of a ToggleButton control is
   False.
<P>
</UL><h3>Events</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Click Event: When the user clicks on the active page or tab of a
   MultiPage or the active tab of a TabStrip, the Click event is initiated.
   However, if the MultiPage or TabStrip contains multiple rows of page
   tabs, the Click event is only initiated for tabs in the foremost row of
   pages.
<P>
</UL><h3>Properties</h3>
 

<UL><LI>AutoTab Property: When this property is True, the TabKeyBehavior
   property is not in effect.

<LI>AutoSize Property: Setting the AutoSize property to True adjusts the
   size of a control to fit the text within it. If you change the text in a
   control after setting AutoSize to True, you must also set AutoSize to
   False and then back to True to get the control to resize.

<LI>DragBehavior Property: fmDragBehaviorEnabled should not be used with
   MatchRequired = True.

<LI>IMEMode Property: The following is a more detailed description of the
   IMEMode property.
<P>
<PRE>      IMEMode     Meaning
      ----------  --------------------------------------------

      NoControl        The control does not affect the IME.

      On               Activates the IME without changing its
                       language or other settings.

      Off              Turns the IME off without affecting the
                       language or other settings.  In China,
                       Off also switches the keyboard to non-IME.

      Disabled         Makes the IME disappear so that its settings
                       cannot be changed.

</PRE><LI>All other values set the IME to a particular language.

<LI>Controls, such as command buttons, that do not allow typing will disable
   the IME while they have focus.

<LI>Every control makes a copy of the IME state in effect when that control
   receives focus. When it loses focus, it restores this saved state. This
   saving and restoring occurs without regard to the value of the IMEMode
   property of the control. This differs slightly from the example in the
   Help text.

<LI>Each change that a user makes to the IME while a control has focus
   immediately updates that control's IMEMode property (if it has one).

<LI>All controls will accept setting all IME modes without error, but when a
   mode is not "native" to a locale it will:
<P>
   a. Not be listed in property sheets in that locale.
   b. Have the same effect as a native mode. See below.

<LI>All modes are native, except:
<P>
   - Disabled is native only in Japan. Elsewhere, it acts like Off.
<P>
   - In Japan, the Hangul and Hanzi modes are not native. Using them
<P><PRE>     has the same effect as using Hiragana.
</PRE><P>
   - In Korea, the only native modes are NoControl, Hanzi, and Alpha
<P><PRE>     (Full and Half). Off and Disabled have the same effect as Alpha.
     On, Hiragana, Katakana, and Hanzi have the same effect as
     Hangul.
</PRE><P>
   - In China, the Hiragana, Katakana, Hangul, and Hanzi modes are
<P><PRE>     not native. Using them has the same effect as HanziFull or Hanzi
     as appropriate.
</PRE><P>
   - Everywhere else, the only native mode is "NoControl."  All other
<P><PRE>     modes have the effect of "NoControl."
</PRE>
<LI>List Property: The last sentence of the Help text is not correct. You
   can use the List property to copy an entire single dimension or
   multidimensional array of values to a control.

<LI>ListRows Property: Setting ListRows to 0 shows all the rows in the list.

<LI>MatchRequired Property: This property is in effect when the MatchEntry
   property is set to fmMatchEntryComplete or fmMatchEntryFirstLetter, but
   is not enforced when MatchEntry is set to fmMatchEntryNone.

<LI>When the Input Method Editor (IME) is used to process keystrokes, the
   MatchRequired property does not always ensure that the user types a
   matching value in a ComboBox.

<LI>MultiLine Property: When this property is True, the TabKeyBehavior
   property is not in effect.

<LI>ScrollBars Property: Corrections to text are below.
<P>
   - For a single-line control, replace Rule 2 with the following
<P><PRE>     sentence: "When the ScrollBars property is set to
     fmScrollBarsHorizontal or fmScrollBarsBoth, the control shows a
     horizontal scroll bar if the text is longer than the edit
     region.  The height of the control will not be changed, so the
     horizontal scroll bar may overlap the text in the control."
</PRE><P>
   - Ignore Rule 3.
<P>
   - For a MultiLine control, ignore the third bulleted item in Rule 4.

<LI>ShowDropButtonWhen Property: If AutoSize is True, changing the
   ShowDropButtonWhen property immediately changes the size of the control
   based on whether the drop button is visible or hidden.

<LI>SpecialEffect Property: This property does not apply to the
   ToggleButton.

<LI>TabKeyBehavior Property: This property is enforced when AutoTab is False
   and MultiLine is True.

<LI>Value Property: The Value property of the TabStrip is an integer
   indicating the active tab. Zero indicates the first tab. The maximum
   value is one less than the number of tabs.

<LI>Visible Property: You are not allowed to change the Visible property of
   a control during the Layout event or Enter event. Doing so will cause an
   error at run time.
<P>
</UL><h3>Other Known Issues</h3>
 
<P>
The Marquee control included with Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 does not
work properly in Microsoft Forms 2.0. This is a known problem that will be
fixed in a future release of Internet Explorer.
<P>
Calling "Unload Me" during the Enter event of a Microsoft Forms 2.0
CommandButton, OptionButton, or CheckBox may result in an "Out of stack
space" error or may cause an "illegal operation" error. The workaround is
to call "Unload Me" during the Click event instead.
