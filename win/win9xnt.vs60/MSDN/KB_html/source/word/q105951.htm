The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can convert an embedded object to a different file format by selecting
another application as the source application for the object. For example,
suppose you receive a Word document that has a Microsoft Excel worksheet
embedded in it. Although you do not have Microsoft Excel installed on your
computer, you can specify another application to use for future editing of
the embedded worksheet.
<P>
To activate the Convert dialog box, first select the object you want to
edit. Choose the name of the object you want to edit from the bottom of the
Edit menu, then choose Convert.
<P>
This article describes what criteria Word uses to display the list of
applications in the Convert dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For applications to be listed in the Convert dialog box, they must support
OLE 2.0 and be able to convert the file type listed in the REG.DAT
conversion section. For example, Word is listed as being able to convert
Word documents. The convert option is for OLE 2.0 objects only. You cannot
use the Convert dialog box to convert your Word documents to another file
format.
<P>
In the REG.DAT file, a key called Conversion is associated with each class.
From this key there are two subkeys: Readable (Convert) and Readwriteable
(ActivateAs). Each of these keys has a list of formats.
<P>
For example:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Word 6.0 Document
       |
       |--Conversion
             |
             |-- Readable
             |-- Main = MSWordDoc,WordDocument

</PRE>In this example, the list tells applications that Word can be listed in the
Convert dialog box as an application that can "Convert" Word documents.
<P>
Note that because there is no Readwritable key, Word would not be listed
as an application that can "Activate As" a Word object.
<P>
For more information, see the "Converting an Embedded Object to a Different
Format" section in Chapter 28, "Exchanging Information with Other
Applications," in "Microsoft Word User's Guide" for version 6.0.
