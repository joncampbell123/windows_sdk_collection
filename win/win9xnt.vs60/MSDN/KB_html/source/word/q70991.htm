The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,
   2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Word reserves special names for macros that you can create to alter the way
Word behaves. These are called auto macros. The auto macros in Microsoft
Word are:
<P>
<PRE>   AutoExec
   AutoNew
   AutoOpen
   AutoClose
   AutoExit

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Word recognizes a macro whose name begins with "Auto" as a macro that runs
automatically when the situation to which it applies arises. You supply the
actual steps for the auto macro by either writing or recording the macro.
<P>
You can prevent an auto macro from running by holding down the SHIFT key
when you perform the action that triggers the macro.
<P>
NOTE: There are also a variety of start-up switches that can be used with
Word. For more information regarding startup switches, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../word/q70014.htm">Q70014</A></B>
   TITLE     : Word for Windows Startup Switches

</PRE><h3>Description of Auto Macros</h3>
 
<P>
AutoExec:
<P>
The AutoExec macro runs when you start Word. This macro makes it easy to
instruct Word to automatically make adjustments when you start Word. For
example, you can create an AutoExec macro that automatically changes the
default directory when you open Word for Windows.
<P>
For more information on how to change the default directory, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../word/q110629.htm">Q110629</A></B>
   TITLE     : Macro to Change Default FileSaveAs Directory

</PRE>The AutoExec macro runs when Word starts if the AutoExec macro was saved as
part of the default (Normal.dot) template or if it was saved as part of a
global add-in.
<P>
To prevent AutoExec from running, type
<P>
<PRE> winword /m

</PRE>into a command prompt to start Word.
<P>
AutoNew:
<P>
The AutoNew macro runs after you create a new document based on a current
template. For example, an AutoNew macro could update all the fields in a
document, attached to a template of choice, and then run when you open a
new document based on that template. The AutoNew macro runs when New is
selected on the File menu in Word if the AutoNew macro was saved as part of
the current template.
<P>
The AutoNew macro does not run if the AutoNew macro was saved as part of a
global add-in. The AutoNew macro is available when selecting Macros from
the Tools menu.
<P>
AutoOpen:
<P>
The AutoOpen macro runs after you open a file with the FileOpen or FileFind
command, or from the list of the last four documents that were opened
(see the bottom of the File menu).
<P>
The AutoOpen macro runs when Open is selected from the File menu and the
AutoOpen macro was saved as part of the current template.
<P>
The AutoOpen macro does not run if the AutoOpen macro was saved as part of
a global add-in. The AutoOpen macro is available when Macros is selected on
the Tools menu.
<P>
AutoClose:
<P>
The AutoClose macro runs when you close a document. The AutoClose macro
will run when Close is selected on the File menu and the AutoClose macro
was saved as part of the current template.
<P>
The AutoClose macro will not run if the macro was saved as part of a global
add-in. The AutoClose macro is available when Macros is selected on the
Tools menu.
<P>
AutoExit:
<P>
The AutoExit macro runs when you quit Word.
<P>
The AutoExit macro runs when Word exits if the macro was saved as part of
the default (Normal.dot) template or when saved as part of a template that
has been added into the Startup folder or added as a global template.
