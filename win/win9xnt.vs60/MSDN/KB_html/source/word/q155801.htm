The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Word 97, the color of the Previous Page and Next Page buttons
on the vertical scroll bar change to blue, and the ToolTips change to
Previous Find/GoTo and Next Find/GoTo.
<P>
Also, when you press these buttons or their shortcut keys (CTRL+PAGE UP or
CTRL+PAGE DOWN), the insertion point either remains in the same place, goes
to an incorrect location, or Word displays the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Word has reached the {beginning or end} of the document. Do you want to
   continue searching at the {beginning or end}?

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Previous Page and Next Page buttons are black by default. When a
different browse object type is selected, other than Browse by Page, the
buttons turn blue to indicate that the Previous and Next buttons have been
reassigned. The ToolTips for these buttons also indicate the current button
assignments.
<P>
For example, the prompt to "continue searching" indicates that a search is
active, and the buttons have been reassigned to Previous Find/GoTo and Next
Find/GoTo.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use any of the following methods to reset the Previous and Next buttons to
Previous Page and Next Page.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Reset the Select Browse Object to Browse By Page</h3>
 
<P>
Click the Select Browse Object button (located between the Next and
Previous buttons on the scroll bar), and then click the Browse By Page icon
(far right, top row).
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Create Macros to Reset the Buttons Automatically</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
You will need to create two macros (BrowseNext and BrowsePrev) that will
automatically reset the Browse Object buttons when you click them. Use the
following procedure to create the macros.
<P>
<P><h3>To Create the BrowseNext Macro</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new Word 97 document.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Macros.

<P><LI>Under Macro Name, type "BrowseNext" (without the quotation marks).
   In the Macros In box, click to select "All active templates and
   documents", and then click Create.
<P>
   NOTE: This macro has to be called BrowseNext so that it will function
<PRE>         When you click the Next Page button.

</PRE><P><LI>Change the existing BrowseNext macro to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub BrowseNext()
   '
   ' BrowseNext Macro
   ' Jump to the next browse object.
   '
      Application.Browser.Target=wdBrowsePage
      Application.Browser.Next

   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>On the File menu, click Save Normal.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Close and Return to Microsoft Word.
<P>
</OL><h3>To Create the BrowsePrev Macro</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>With your new Word 97 document still open, on the Tools menu, point to
   Macro, and then click Macros.

<P><LI>Under Macro Name type "BrowsePrev" (without the quotation marks).
   In the Macros In box, click to select "All active templates and
   documents", and then click Create.
<P>
   NOTE: This macro has to be called BrowsePrev so that it will function
<PRE>         when you click the Previous Page button.

</PRE><P><LI>Change the existing BrowsePrev macro to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub BrowsePrev()
   '
   ' BrowsePrev Macro
   ' Jump to the previous browse object
   '
      Application.Browser.Target=wdBrowsePage
      Application.Browser.Previous

   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>On the File menu, click Save Normal.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Close and Return to Microsoft Word.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 3: Record Resetting the Select Browse Object to Browse By Page</h3>
 
<P>
To record the action of resetting the Browse Object to Browse by Page:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu point to Macro and click Record New Macro.

<P><LI>Enter a name for the macro in the Macro name text box and click OK.

<P><LI>Click the Select Browse Object button (located between the Next and
   Previous buttons on the scroll bar), and then click the Browse By
   Page icon (far right, top row).

<P><LI>On the Tools menu point to Macro and click Stop Recording.
<P>
</OL>You can then assign this macro to a toolbar or menu item.
<P>

<P><h3>Browse Buttons</h3>
 
<P>
The Select Browse Object button (located between the Next and Previous
buttons on the scrollbar) enables you to select a number of additional
object types. Word may assign one of the following properties to the Next
and Previous buttons after you attempt to go to any of these objects:
<P>
<PRE>   Field
   Endnote
   Footnote
   Comment
   Section
   Edits
   Heading
   Graphic
   Table

</PRE>For example, if you attempt to go to a comment, the buttons change to
Previous Comment and Next Comment. Another example would be when you
click Find on the Edit menu. Once you click Find to find an item, the
Select Browse Object buttons will be set to Next or Previous Find/GoTo.
<P>
For more information about the Select Browse Object buttons, click the
Office Assistant, type "What is select browse object?" (without the
quotation marks), click Search, click the "Move around in a document"
topic, and then click to view "Scroll through a document by using the
mouse."
<P>
NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Microsoft Help is not installed on your computer,
