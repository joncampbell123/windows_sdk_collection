<P>
To return the name of the macro assigned to a custom menu or toolbar
command, use the OnAction Property as in the following sample macro:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub GetMacroCommandAssignment()
      For Each cb In CommandBars("AutoText").Controls
         On Error Resume Next
         MsgBox cb.OnAction
      Next cb
   End Sub

</PRE>NOTE: You cannot return command assignments for built-in menu or toolbar
commands.
<P>

<P>
To find out which macro or Word command is assigned to a menu command, use
the Customize command on the Tools menu. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Customize.

<P><LI>Click the Menus tab.

<P><LI>Select the appropriate setting in the Categories list.

<P><LI>Select a macro or command in the Commands list. If that macro or command
   is assigned to a menu, its name appears in the Position On Menu box. If
   not, (Auto) is displayed in the Position On Menu box.
<P>
   In addition, if a command is assigned to the menu currently selected in
   the Change What Menu box, the Add button changes to the Rename button.
   (This does not happen if you select a command that is assigned to a menu
   that is not currently selected in the Change What Menu box).
