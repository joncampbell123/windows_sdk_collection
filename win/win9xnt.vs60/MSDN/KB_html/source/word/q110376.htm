<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word version 6.0 and later do not have a keyboard activated ruler 
like Word 2.0 for Windows does. (In Word 2.0, you can press CTRL+SHIFT+F10 
to make the ruler active.) The ruler in Word 6.0 and later is accessible 
only by using a mouse.
<P>
Microsoft increased the functionality of the ruler in Word 6.0 as the
result of customer feedback. The additional mouse functionality required a
loss of keyboard functionality to prevent too much complexity. As a result,
there is no longer a ruler mode you can activate to allow setting tabs and
indents directly from the keyboard.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
New functions and changes to the ruler in Word 6.0 and later include:

<UL><LI>The indent and margin modes were combined.
<LI>You automatically switch to table mode when in a table.
<LI>Page layout view now has a vertical ruler.
<LI>You can set all indents using the mouse without keyboard intervention.
   (Previously you had to hold down the SHIFT key to drag the body indent
   triangle.)
<LI>You can choose the type of tab from the ruler.
<LI>The visual style has been improved to make it easier to use.
<P>
</UL>To set all paragraph settings using the keyboard, click either Paragraph
or Tabs on the Format menu.
