The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Assistant for Word, versions 1.0z, 2.0z
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95 version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you convert non-HTML forms to HTML, the following features are lost:

<UL><LI>Paragraph indention is removed.
<LI>Tabs are removed.
<LI>Right-, centered-, and justified-aligned paragraphs convert to left
   aligned.
<LI>Line spacing is converted to single spacing.
<LI>Columns are removed.
<LI>Calculation fields are converted to regular text, and their expressions
   appear as text inside the form fields.
<LI>Text immediately preceding the first form field is not included between
   the top of form and bottom of form section breaks. For example, the
   following
<P>
<P><PRE>      Invoice # [formfield]
</PRE><P>
   converts to this:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Invoice #
      ================top of form===================
      [formfield]
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      ===============bottom of form=================
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior in Internet Assistant for Word is by design. Your non-HTML
form document contains some elements that will not be preserved during
conversion to HTML.
<P>
For a list of items that do not convert and more information on converting
Word documents to HTML, choose "Internet Assistant for Word Help" from the
Help menu, choose the Search button, select "Converting a Word Document to
HTML," choose Show Topics, select the "What is Lost When Word Documents are
Converted to HTML" topic, and choose the Go To button.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Method 1: To create a form in Internet Assistant choose the Insert menu and
<PRE>          select Form Field. Enter the form fields from this dialog box to
          get the proper HTML tags assigned when saving.

          To preserve other formatting assign various styles to your text.
          Use a combination of definition lists, ordered or unordered
          lists, and preformatted styles.

</PRE>Method 2: Edit the Raw HTML source by opening your form in Notepad. Move
<PRE>          the form related text between the &lt;FORM&gt; and &lt;/FORM&gt; tags.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you create an HTML document using Internet Assistant commands and the
toolbar, your document will not lose any formatting when it is saved as
HTML and brought back into Word. However, when a Word document is not
created with Internet Assistant, it may contain some elements that will not
e brought back into Word after it is saved as HTML.
<P>
For more information on creating forms, choose "Internet Assistant for Word
Help" from the Help menu, choose the Search button, select "Form Element,"
choose Show Topics, select the "HTML Forms and Equivalent Word Commands"
topic, and choose the Go To button.
