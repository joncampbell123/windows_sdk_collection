<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you use a text file (*.txt) as a data source for a mail merge, extended
characters such as accented characters are replaced by symbols with no
similarity to the expected characters. However, if you open the data source
text file in the editor used to create the text file, the characters appear
correct.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you use text files created in a Microsoft Windows-
based word processing program, such as Microsoft Notepad or Microsoft Word.
<P>
In a text file, each character is saved as a numeric value. Windows-based
programs usually use the numeric values in the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) character set. MS-DOS programs however use the numeric
values from the ASCII character set, which does not include the extended
characters. Therefore, MS-DOS programs use the OEM character set to define
the extended characters.
<P>
When Word sees a text file as the mail merge data source, it assumes that
it was created in an MS-DOS based program and translates the characters
using the ASCII character set. As a result the extended (accented)
characters are lost.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correctly use your text file (*.txt) as a Microsoft Word mail merge data
source, use any of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Convert the Text File to Word Document Format</h3>
 
<P>
To convert the text file to Word document format, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the text file (*.txt) in Word.
   The accented characters should be visible.

<P><LI>Save the file as a Word document (*.doc).

<P><LI>Use this file as the mail merge data source.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2:  Convert the Text File to Microsoft Excel Format</h3>
 
<P>
To convert the text file to Excel format, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the text file (*.txt) in Excel.
   This starts the Text Import Wizard.

<P><LI>Follow the instructions in the Wizard and then save the file as an
   Microsoft Excel Workbook (*.xls) file.

<P><LI>Use this Excel file as the mail merge data source.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 3: Modify the Registry Entries for Word</h3>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
If you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency
Repair Disk (ERD).
<P>
To change the default behavior of mail merge text import, modify one of the
following keys in the Windows Registry.

<OL><P><LI>Quit Word.

<P><LI>On the Start menu, click Run.

<P><LI>In the Run box, type "REGEDIT" (without the quotation marks), and
   click OK.

<P><LI>Locate either of the following registry entries:
<P>
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Jet\3.0\Engines\Text
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE><P>
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Jet\3.5\Engines\Text

<P><LI>Click to select the CharacterSet entry in the right pane.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Modify

<P><LI>In the Value Data box, type "ANSI" (without the quotation marks) and
   press ENTER.

<P><LI>Quit the Registry Editor and start Word.
<P>
</OL>Word now assumes that all text files that you use as mail merge data
sources come from a Windows-based program. Word therefore uses the ANSI
character set to import extended characters correctly.
<P>
NOTE: Extended characters in text files that were created in MS-DOS based
programs will be imported incorrectly since this workaround applies only to
Microsoft Windows-based programs.
