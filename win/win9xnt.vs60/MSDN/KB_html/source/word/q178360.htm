The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Save As command to save a file to an NT file system (NTFS)
partition on your computer, and when the original file exists on a server
NTFS partition, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Word cannot complete the save due to a file permission error

</PRE>This error message will occur under Windows NT 4.0 when the following
conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The file on the server share has Change permissions granted to a local
   group,
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You logged onto the client machine as a member of this local group,
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You are not a member of a group with greater permissions to the file.
<P>
</UL>Also note that a temporary file will be left on the destination path of the
attempted save, and this file will have permissions duplicating those of
the original file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When performing the Save As operation, Word first copies the permissions
from the server file to a newly created temporary file. It then attempts to
rename the temporary file. The rename fails, because the access rights from
the original file do not resolve to the logged on user on the client
machine. This occurs because local groups only have meaning on the machine
where they are defined. The only exceptions to this are local groups
defined on a primary domain controller, which are replicated to all backup
domain controllers in the domain.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, upgrade to Word 97 for Windows.
<P>
To work around this problem, use any of the following methods.

<UL><LI>Copy the file from the server to the local machine before opening it in
   Word.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>From Word, use a FAT partition for the destination path for the file
   when you use the Save As command.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Grant Change permissions on the file to a Global group, and add the
   appropriate users to the same group.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word for Windows
95, version 7.0. This Problem was corrected in Word 97 for Windows.
