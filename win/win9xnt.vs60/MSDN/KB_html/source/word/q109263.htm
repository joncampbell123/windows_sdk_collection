The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh versions 5.0 and 5.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Microsoft Word 5.0 or 5.1 for the Macintosh, the following
message may occur:
<P>
<PRE>   System Memory Too Low to Run Word; OK &lt;button&gt;

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Word verifies with the System that the standard file package (SFP), which
needs to be loaded to open and save files, is already loaded in the
System's memory heap. If the SFP is not loaded, Word asks the System to
load it. If the System cannot (due to lack of memory), this error will
occur.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the versions of Word listed
above. This problem was corrected in Word version 6.0 for the Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
A second attempt at starting Word sometimes is successful, assuming the
System adjusts its heap space. However, due to the numerous possible system
configurations, there is no permanent or certain solution. The following
section suggests ways to eliminate the problem.

<OL><P><LI>Install a utility that can increase the size of the System heap. With
   initially sufficient heap space, the System will not have to "grow" its
   heap size when attempting to load the SFP module.

<P><LI>Load Word with a different allocation of memory. In some instances,
   the problem will go away by changing the allocation (by just a few
   bytes--from, say, 2048 to 2050). This number differs from machine to
   machine, so try numbers above and below Word's current memory
   allocation.

<P><LI>Load something before Word to force the SFP package to load. For
   example, loading Alarm Clock causes Word to load further down in RAM.

<P><LI>Load the System extensions in a different order or remove nonessential
   ones so the System will have enough memory to load the SFP module.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Word verifies with the System that the SFP module is loaded in the System's
memory heap, and if so, Word launches. If the SFP is not loaded, Word
queries the System as to whether or not there is enough room in the
System's heap to load the SFP into memory. If there is enough memory, the
System loads the SFP into the System heap and Word launches correctly.
<P>
If there is not enough memory allocated to the System to load the SFP and
the System loads Word too close to the System's heap, the System cannot
reallocate memory to itself. In order to load SFP module, Word forces
itself to quit and unloads itself from memory (so that the System can
"grow" its heap and load the SFP).
<P>
The System is loading Word too close to the end of its heap space. In this
case, the System cannot "grow" its heap enough to load the Standard File
Package because Word has been assigned the memory block that the System
must grow into.
<P>
Word verifies that the SFP module is already loaded (and forces the System
to load if it is not loaded), because this module is necessary for saving
documents in Word.
<P>
The Standard File Package is a small module of system code that allows
applications to Open and Save files.
