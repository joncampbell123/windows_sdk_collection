<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you format text with a symbol font, such as Wingdings, and then change
to a non-symbol font such as Times New Roman, the text is replaced with box
characters.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Word displays the box characters after it translates the symbol font to its
Unicode equivalent.
<P>
This problem occurs when you do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Format text using a symbol font, such as Wingdings.

<P><LI>Select the text from Step 1 and apply a non-symbol font, such as Times
   New Roman.
<P>

</PRE><h3>Unicode</h3>
 
<P>
Unicode is a 16-bit character set designed to cover all the world's major
living languages, in addition to scientific symbols and dead languages that
are the subject of scholarly interest. It eliminates the complexity of
multi-byte character sets that are currently used on UNIX and Windows to
support Asian languages. A consortium of companies including Apple,
Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard (HP), Digital, and IBM created Unicode. These
companies used information from the ISO-10646 standard to produce a single
standard in 1993. Unicode is the basis for the Windows NT operating system.
<P>
Unicode is a 16-bit character set where all characters occupy the same
space. The first 256 values are the same as the ISO-Latin character set,
which is also the basis for the ANSI character set used in Windows 3.1 and
Windows 95. However, Unicode defines 34,168 distinct coded characters. In
most character sets a single value is often assigned to several characters.
For example, in ASCII a "-" is used to represent a hyphen, a minus sign, a
dash, and a non-breaking hyphen. In Unicode, each meaning is given its own
code; that is, a hyphen is represented by a character different from a
minus sign, and so forth. The Unicode standard contains only one instance
of each character and assigns it a unique name and code value. It also
supports "combining" accent characters, which follow the base character
that they are to modify.
<P>
