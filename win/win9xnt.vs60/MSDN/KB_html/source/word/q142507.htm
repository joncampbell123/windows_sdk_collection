<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to create simple spreadsheets in Microsoft Word, 
using tables and the Formula (=) field. In these spreadsheets, you can add, 
subtract, multiply, and divide values entered in cells.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>REFERENCING CELLS</h3>
 
<P>
Individual cells are referenced by column letter and row number in the
form of "A1" where A represents the column and 1 represents the row. For
example, A2 refers to the cell located in the first column second row.
To select a row only, the syntax would be "2:2," and to select a column
the syntax would be "A:A."
<P>
Examples refer to the following table and can be placed in any blank
cell in the table:
<P>
<PRE>   -------------
   | 2 | 5 | 4 |
   -------------
   | 7 | 3 | 6 |
   -------------
   | 8 | 1 | 0 |
   -------------
   |   |   |   |
   -------------

</PRE>Using this example, you could enter the sum of column A into the blank 
cell, A4 by following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Place your insertion point into the blank cell A4.

<P><LI>On the Table menu, click Formula.

<P><LI>Under Formula, an automated formula (=SUM(ABOVE)) is shown. You can
   delete that entry and enter any type of formula as shown in the
   next section of this article.

<P><LI>You can either leave the Number Format box blank or select an item on 
   the list.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Operations You Can Use to Manipulate Values in Cells</h3>
 
<P>
Addition:

                               -or-

                               -or-
                               =sum(b1:b3)

   To do this                    similar to this    the sample
   ------------------------------------------------------------

   Subtract a number from a cell =(a1)- 3           1

   Subtract two cells            =(a3-b2)           5


</PRE>Multiplication:
<P>
<PRE>                                    Use a formula      Result from
   To do this                       similar to this    the sample
   ---------------------------------------------------------------

   Multiply a number by a cell      =(a1)* 3           6

   Multiply two adjacent cells      =product(a1:a2)    14

   Multiply two non-adjacent cells  =product(a1,a3)    16

   Multiply a range of cells        =product(b:b)      15
                                    -or-
                                    =product(b1:b2)

</PRE>Division:
<P>
<PRE>                                   Use a formula    Result from
   To do this                      similar to this  the sample
   ------------------------------------------------------------

   Divide a number by a cell       =(a1)/3         .67

   Divide two cells                =c2/a1           3


</PRE><h3>Referring to Cells</h3>
 
<P>
Syntax:
<P>
Unlike earlier versions of Word, individual cell references do not
need to be enclosed in brackets and parentheses. However, cell ranges,
which are separated with a colon such as (A1:A6), must be enclosed in
parentheses.
<P>
Referencing Cell Ranges:
<P>
If the cells are in a contiguous block (they cover a rectangular area),
you can shorten the reference to them. For instance, the eight-cell
area from A1 to D2 can be referenced as A1:D2.
<P>
Referencing Nonadjacent Cells:
<P>
When you add or multiply nonadjacent cells, you can refer to each cell
individually, or you can separate the references themselves with
commas.
<P>
NOTE: You can use commas only with the Sum and Product functions.
<P>
For example, these formulas are equivalent:
<P>
<PRE>   Sum Example
   -----------

   {=sum(a1) + sum(c2) + sum(b2)}
   {=sum(a1,c2,b2)}

   Product Example
   ---------------

   {=product(a1) + product(c2) + product(b2)}
   {=product(a1,c2,b2)}

</PRE>When you subtract or divide nonadjacent cells, you must refer to each
cell separately (that is, you cannot use commas), as in the following
examples:
<P>
<PRE>     {=sum(a1) - sum(c2) - sum(b3)}
     {=sum(a1) / sum(c2) / sum(b3)}


</PRE>Relative References:
<P>
Relative references are useful when you want a generic formula that
doesn't refer to specific cells. You can add and delete rows and maintain a 
correct result. Relative references are also useful when you don't want to 
retype a formula. For instance, if you want each cell in the fifth column 
to contain the sum of the numbers of the first four columns in the same 
row, you can use a relative reference. In this example, the field would 
resemble the following:
<P>
<PRE>   {=sum(left)}

</PRE>You can also combine relative references with absolute references 
(references to a specific cell).
<P>
Bookmark References:
<P>
You can apply a bookmark to the contents of any cell or field and use that
bookmark in a calculation. This can often simplify the construction of
other fields and can save typing.
<P>
For example, if you apply a bookmark called "quantity_sold" to the
contents of cell a3, you can refer to it in another cell.
<P>
<PRE>      {=quantity_sold*.10}
      {=quantity_sold*sum(b2)}
      {=quantity_sold*commission}

</PRE>References to Avoid:
<P>
If you refer to an entire row or column and place the field within that
range, Word includes the field result in the calculation. Each time you 
update the calculation, it will include itself in the result. This produces 
a different result (even if none of the other numbers in the row or column 
have changed) and yields unreliable results.
<P>
<PRE>   Examples of the Type of Field to Avoid
   --------------------------------------

   {=sum(c:c)} adds the entire column, including the result. Each time
   you update this field, the result is the sum of the column plus
   the field's previous total. To prevent this behavior, use an absolute 
   reference instead, and place the field in another column.
