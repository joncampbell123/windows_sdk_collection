The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you have a Graphics Blaster 3D video card, when you start Microsoft Word
97, Word may stop responding.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when you install any of the following video drivers
that ship with Graphics Blaster 3D Installation CD (DISK.ID - G334-CDSTD-2-
US):
<P>
<PRE>   File name        Version
   ----------------------------------
   Ma33xw95.drv     4.03.00.2101-1.04
   Ma33xw95.vxd     4.03.00.2101-1.04
   Ma33xdd.dll      4.03.00.2101-1.04

</PRE>To determine what version of the video driver you have, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the System icon.

<P><LI>On the Device Manager tab, double-click the Display Adapters icon.

<P><LI>Double-click the Graphics Blaster 3D icon.

<P><LI>Click the Driver tab.

<P><LI>Click Driver File Details. Under Driver Files, click to select the file
   name of the driver, and verify the version number under File Version.
<P>
</OL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Use a Different Animated Cursor</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the Mouse icon.

<P><LI>On the Pointers tab, select a different pointer or scheme.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>If this method does not work, install Microsoft Plus! or load a Microsoft
Plus! theme that ships with its own set of cursors.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Decrease the Graphics Hardware Acceleration</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>In the Control Panel, double-click the System icon.

<P><LI>On the Performance tab, click Graphics.

<P><LI>Choose a Hardware Acceleration setting with less acceleration. Note that
   the Hardware Acceleration slider has four settings: Full, Most, Basic,
   and None. Each of these settings is described below, in order of
   decreasing acceleration.
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Full:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      This is the default setting, which allows for full hardware
      acceleration.
</PRE><P>
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Most:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      The Most setting applies to Western Digital (WD) or S3-compatible
      drivers. If you have problems with the way the mouse pointer appears
      on the screen, try the Most setting.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      This setting adds SWCursor=1 to the [Display] section of the
      System.ini file, which turns off the hardware cursor.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: This setting is similar to using the /Y switch with some
      versions of the MS-DOS-level Microsoft Mouse driver.
</PRE><P>
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Basic:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      The Basic setting applies to S3-compatible video drivers.
      If your computer seems to stop responding randomly, try the Basic
      setting.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      This setting makes the following changes to your Win.ini and
      System.ini files:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         - Adds SafeMode=1 to the [Windows] section of the Win.ini file,
           which allows for basic acceleration only, for example, pattern
           bit block transfer (bitblt) and screen-to-screen bitblt.

         - Adds MMIO=0 to the [Display] section of the System.ini file,
           which turns off memory-mapped input/output (I/O) for S3-
           compatible drivers.

         - Adds SWCursor=1 to the [Display] section of the System.ini file,
           which turns off the hardware cursor.


    - None:

      The None setting applies to S3-compatible video drivers.
      If your computer seems to stop responding randomly, and the Basic
      setting does not resolve the problem, try the None setting.

      This setting makes the following changes to your Win.ini and
      System.ini files:

       - Adds SafeMode=2 to the [Windows] section of the Win.ini file,
         which turns off all video card acceleration. For example, the
         graphics device interface (GDI) calls the device-independent
         bitmap (DIB) engine directly for screen drawing, rather than using
         the display driver.

       - Adds MMIO=0 to the [Display] section of the System.ini file,
         which turns off memory-mapped I/O for S3-compatible drivers.

       - Adds SWCursor=1 to the [Display] section of the System.ini file,
         which turns off the hardware cursor.
