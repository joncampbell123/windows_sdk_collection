The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You cannot use the Bullets And Numbering command (on the Format menu) to
place a bullet in the middle of a sentence or paragraph.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design. Because Bullets and Numbering is a paragraph
level format, bullets are always placed at the beginning of a paragraph.
Bullets cannot be placed in the middle of paragraphs or words.
<P>
This functionality is different from earlier versions of Word in which
bullets were inserted as characters.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use any of the following methods to insert a
bullet in the middle of a sentence.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Use the Insert Symbol Command</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Symbol.

<P><LI>On the Symbols tab, click to select the bullet character.

<P><LI>Click Insert and then click Close.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Use the ASCII Key Code</h3>
 
<P>
Use the Key Caps utility to identify the key combination to insert a
bullet.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 3: Use a Table</h3>
 
<P>
Place your text inside a table. For example, if you want to have a bullet
approximately three inches from the left margin, create a two column table
and make the left column three inches wide. Place the insertion point
in the right column, and then use the Bullets and Numbering command to
insert a bullet.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 4: Use a Macro</h3>

The following sample Visual Basic for Applications macro inserts a bullet.

<PRE>   Sub InsertBullet()
      With Selection
         .Collapse Direction:=wdCollapseStart
         .InsertSymbol Font:="Symbol", CharacterNumber:=183, Unicode:=False
      End With
   End Sub
