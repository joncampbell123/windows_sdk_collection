The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,
   2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Windows operating system version and 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Word 2.x for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using the ULTRA640.DRV video driver with Word for Windows and
you run the Getting Started tutorial, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   GP Fault in ULTRA640.DRV

</PRE>The general protection (GP) fault occurs approximately 12 screens into
the Getting Started tutorial lessons.
<P>
Note: You can get the ULTRA640.DRV video driver from either the
Windows Driver Library (WDL) for Microsoft Windows operating system
version 3.1 or you can get it directly from ATI when you purchase the
ATI Ultra video card. The most current driver, available from ATI as
of July 1992, is dated 4/22/92. To download these drivers from the ATI
BBS call (905)764-9404. (9600: 2400-12008 data bits, 1 stop bit, no
parity.)
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the ULTRA640.DRV video
driver. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here as it becomes available.
<P>
Note: This problem has also been observed while scrolling in outline view.
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
The ULTRA800.DRV and the ULTRA.DRV (1024) drivers do not generate this
GP fault in the Getting Started lessons. Choose the Windows Setup icon
in the Main group to set up one of these display drivers or the
standard VGA driver.
<P>
Notes: Your ULTRA.DRV driver should have a file date of 8/92 or later.
If you are using Ultra Crystal fonts, your ULTRAGS.DRV file should
have a file date of 9/92 or later (Crystal fonts only work at the
1024x768 resolution).
<P>

559-560 of the version 3.1 "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."
