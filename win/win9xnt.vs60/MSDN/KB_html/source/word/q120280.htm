The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you place a caption on the same line as an embedded object, Word 
includes the entire paragraph when you insert a cross-reference to the 
caption's label and number.
<P>
For example, if you have an embedded equation on the left and a caption on
the right
<P>
<PRE>     y = mx + b                    Equation 3.7

</PRE>then when you insert a cross-reference and select Label And Number, Word
repeats the line shown above, rather than inserting just "Equation 3.7."
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When Word inserts a cross-reference to a caption, it places a bookmark on
the entire paragraph. If the paragraph contains more than the equation, the
equation is included in the cross-reference.
<P>
<P>
NOTE: If you are not using AutoCaption, you can place a caption on
the same line as an equation by placing the insertion point to the
right of the equation, and choosing Insert Caption. If you are using
AutoCaption, you cannot place the caption next to the equation; it
must go either above or below the equation. Once the caption is in
place, however, you can move it to the right of the equation by
deleting the paragraph mark in the equation's paragraph.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Create a two-column, one-row table and place the equation on one side and 
the caption in the other.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Insert a bookmark and cross-reference the manually applied bookmark. To do 
this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Select the caption, being sure to include only the caption
   and not the equation.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Bookmark.

<P><LI>Type a name for the equation. Use a descriptive name so that
   if you rearrange the equations, you'll be able to remember
   which bookmark is which.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Place the insertion point where you want the cross-reference.
   From the Insert menu, choose Cross-Reference.

<P><LI>In the Reference Type list, select Bookmark.

<P><LI>In the Insert Reference To list, select Reference Text.

<P><LI>In the For Which Bookmark list, select the bookmark name you
   gave to the equation.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P></OL>
