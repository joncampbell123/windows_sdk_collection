<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes information about headers or footers. It addresses
what headers and footers are, how they affect margin settings, how to
position them, how to create them, and what different types of headers and
footers exist.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>What Are Headers and Footers?</h3>
 
<P>
A header or footer is text or graphics that is usually printed at the top
or bottom of every page in a document. A header is printed in the top
margin; a footer is printed in the bottom margin.
<P>
Headers and footers can be as simple as the document title and a page
number, but you can create headers and footers that contain graphics,
multiple paragraphs, and fields. You can specify a different header or
footer for odd and even pages or use a different header or footer for the
first page of a section or document. If you divide a document into
sections, you can use different headers and footers in each section. For
example, you might want the header for each section to reflect the title of
that section.
<P>
<P><h3>Adding or Removing Headers and Footers</h3>
 
<P>
To create a header or footer, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the View menu, click Header And Footer. Word displays the Header
   And Footer toolbar and switches to Page Layout view.

<P><LI>To switch between the header and footer, click the "Switch Between
   Header and Footer" button on the Header And Footer toolbar.
<P>
</OL>A non-printing dashed line encloses the header and footer areas. Text and
graphics in the document are visible, but dimmed. To display or hide the
document text, click the Show/Hide Document Text button on the Header And
Footer toolbar.
<P>
You can type and format text in the header or footer area the same way you
do in the main document. Once you have created your header or footer,
click the Close button on the Header And Footer toolbar to return to the
main part of the document. In Page Layout view, the headers and footers are
visible, but appear dimmed.
<P>
To edit an existing header or footer, either click Header And Footer on the
View menu, or in Page Layout view, double-click a dimmed header or footer,
to switch quickly to the header or footer.
<P>
To delete a header or footer, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Position the insertion point somewhere in the main text area of the
   document.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Header And Footer.

<P><LI>Select the header or footer information you want to delete, and then
   press DELETE or BACKSPACE (Windows) or DEL (Macintosh) on the keyboard.

<P><LI>To return to the document, click Close on the Header And Footer toolbar,
   or double-click in the main text area of the document.
<P>
</OL><h3>How Headers and Footers Affect Margin Settings</h3>
 
<P>
Word prints headers and footers in the top and bottom margins. If the
header or footer is too large to fit in the margin, Word adjusts the top
and bottom margin to accommodate the header or footer. That is, if the
header or footer becomes too large to fit in the margin, it will start
expanding downward (for the header) and upward (for the footer), reducing
the amount of document text that can be displayed in the document window.
<P>
To prevent Word from moving the main document text (downward or upward)
when the header or footer gets too large to fit in the margin, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Page Setup (Windows) or Document Layout
   (Macintosh 6.x). Or, on the Format menu, click Document (Word 98
   Macintosh Edition).

<P><LI>Click the Margins tab.

<P><LI>In Word for Windows and Word 98 Macintosh Edition, type a hyphen
   (-) before the Top or Bottom margin setting. Or, in Word for Macintosh
   version 6.x, select the Exactly option beside the Top or Bottom
   measurements.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If the header or footer is too large, it may overwrite (superimpose)
the main document text.
<P>
<P><h3>Positioning Headers and Footers</h3>
 
<P>
You may want to change the position of headers and footers.
<P>
You can change the horizontal position by:

<UL><LI>Centering the header or footer between the left and right margins.

<LI>Aligning it with the left or right margins.

<LI>Running the header or footer text into the left or right margins.
<P>
</UL>The header and footer areas have two preset tab stops: centered between
the default left and right margins (3 inches), and right-aligned at the
default right margin (6 inches). These tab stops make it easy to center a
chapter title or place the page number flush with the right margin. If you
change the margins, you may want to adjust these tab stops.
<P>
To adjust the horizontal position of information inside a header or footer,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the View menu, click Header And Footer.

<P><LI>On the Header And Footer toolbar, click the Show Next and Show Previous
   buttons to find the header or footer that you want to adjust.

<P><LI>To position the header or footer, do one or more of the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - To create left-aligned text in a header or footer, type the text.
      The starting position for the insertion point is left-aligned with
      the left margin of the document.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - To create center-aligned text in a header or footer, press the TAB
      key once to advance the insertion point to the center-aligned tab and
      type the text. The text you type will be centered on the tab.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - To create right-aligned text in a header or footer, press the TAB key
      one more time to advance the insertion point to the right-aligned tab
      and type the text.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - To create a header or footer that runs into the left or right
      margins, you can set negative indents as follows:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       a. On the Format menu, click Paragraph.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       b. Click the Indents And Spacing tab.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       c. Type a negative number for the left and/or right indentation.
<PRE></PRE>          For example, if you want the left-aligned text in the header to
          start 0.5 inches into the left margin, type "-.5" (without the
          quotation marks) for the left indentation. A negative left
          indentation moves text into the left margin, whereas a negative
          right indentation moves text to the right, into the right
          margin.

    - To make additional adjustments to the alignment, use the
      alignment buttons on the Formatting toolbar, set different tab
      stops on the ruler, or drag the indent markers on the ruler.

</PRE></OL>You can change the vertical position by adjusting the header or footer
starting distance from the top or bottom edge of the page. You can also
adjust the amount of space between the header or footer and the text in the
main document. To perform these adjustments, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Position the insertion point in the specific area in the document
   that contains the header or footer that you want to adjust.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Page Setup (Windows), or Document Layout
   (Macintosh 6.x). Or, on the Format menu, click Document (Word 98
   Macintosh Edition), and then click the Margins tab.
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. To change the distance from the edge of page to the header or
       footer, change the From Edge setting. The default setting is 0.5
       inch. Increasing the setting moves the entire header or
       footer closer to the center of the document. Decreasing the setting
       moves the entire header or footer closer to the edge of the page.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. To change the distance between the document text and a header or
       footer, change the Top and Bottom margin settings. Increasing the
       top margin moves the document text farther down on the page,
       while leaving the header in the same location. Decreasing the top
       margin moves the text of the document father up on the page,
       while leaving the header in the same location. The same is true for
       the bottom margin and the footer.
</PRE>
<P><LI>To return to the document, click OK.

   TITLE     : WD: Setting Up Different Header/Footer for Even/Odd Pages

</PRE></OL><h3>Different Headers and Footers for Sections of a Document</h3>
 
<P>
When you divide a document into sections, Word uses the headers and footers
in the first section as the default for every subsequent section. All
headers in the document and all footers in the document are initially
connected so that their contents are identical. If you change the header in
the third section of the document, for example, Word changes all headers in
the entire document to match. When headers and footers in the section that
contains the insertion point are connected to the previous section, the
Same As Previous button on the Header And Footer toolbar is pushed in, and
the words "Same As Previous" appear in the upper right of the dotted
Header or Footer box.
<P>
If you want to create a different header or footer in one section, you must
break the connection with the preceding header or footer by clicking the
Same As Previous button on the Header And Footer toolbar. Word then uses
the header or footer you create in the current section for all subsequent
sections. If you decide that you want to re-establish the connection
between the header or footer in the current section and the preceding
headers or footers, click the Same As Previous button again. Word replaces
the information contained in the current header or footer with
the information in the previous header or footer.
<P>
Headers and footers from one section are automatically connected to headers
and footers from the previous section until you click the Same As Previous
button on the Header And Footer toolbar to turn the setting off. For
example, Headers are connected to only the type of header called Header;
they are not be connected to the type of header called First Page Header.
First Page Header will be connected only to First Page Header.
<P>
The following are the different types of connections between headers and
footers in a document:

<UL><LI>Headers are connected to Headers.
<LI>Footers are connected to Footers.
<LI>First Page Headers are connected to First Page Headers.
<LI>First Page Footers are connected to First Page Footers.
<LI>Odd Headers are connected to Odd Headers.
<LI>Odd Footers are connected to Odd Footers.
<LI>Even Headers are connected to Even Headers.
<LI>Even Footers are connected to Even Footers.

   TITLE     : WD: How to Use Section Breaks in Microsoft Word.

</PRE>To create a different header or footer for each section in a document,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Position the insertion point in the section with the header or footer
   that you want to change (disconnect from the previous header or
   footer).

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Header And Footer.

<P><LI>Click the Same As Previous button on the Header And Footer toolbar to
   disconnect headers and footers in the current section from the previous
   section. The words "Same As Previous" will disappear from the upper-
   right corner of the Header or Footer box.

<P><LI>Create the header and footer that you want for the current section.
<P>
   NOTE: Word also inserts the header and footer in all sections following
   the current one. To create a different header or footer in the
   following sections, repeat steps 3 through 4 in each section.

<P><LI>To return to the document, click the Close button on the Header And
   Footer toolbar.
<P>
</OL>To reconnect a header or footer with the preceding header or footer, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Position the insertion point in the section with the header or footer
   that you want to connect to the preceding header or footer.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Header And Footer.

<P><LI>On the Header And Footer toolbar, click the Same As previous button.
<P>
   NOTE: When Word asks you to confirm that you want to delete the current
   header or footer and connect to the preceding header or footer, click
<P><PRE>    Yes. The preceding header or footer is repeated in the current section.
