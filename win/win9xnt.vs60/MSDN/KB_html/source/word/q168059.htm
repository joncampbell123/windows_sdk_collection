The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you create a link to a Microsoft Word 6.x or Microsoft Word 7.x
document and paste it into a MFC (Microsoft Foundation Class) OClient
container, and then double-click the link on a computer that only has Word
97 installed, you may receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot Start the Source Application For This Object


</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, install Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1 (SR-
1).
<P>
To work around this problem, open the container application and the
document on the computer that only has Microsoft Word 97, and reinsert the
link to the Word document.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for
Windows. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Word 97 SR-1.
<P>
For additional information about SR-1, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : OFF97: How to Obtain and Install MS Office 97 SR-1

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem will occur when pasting links to WordPad or any of the
Microsoft Office applications, because WordPad and the Office applications
are MFC OClient containers.
<P>
The Microsoft Foundation Class Library, a C++ Windows interface, is built
on top of the C-language Windows application programming interface (API)
to ensure long-term compatibility with the thousands of applications
already written for Windows. MFC is a truly object-oriented interface
designed with the following goals:

<UL><LI>Significantly reduced effort for programming an application for
   Windows

<LI>Execution speed comparable to that of the C-language API

<LI>Minimum code size overhead

<LI>Ability to call any Windows C functions directly

<LI>Easier conversion of existing C applications to C++

<LI>Ability to leverage from the existing base of C-language Windows
   programming experience

<LI>True Windows API for C++ that effectively uses C++ language features
<P>
</UL>The core of the Microsoft Foundation Class library encapsulates a large
portion of the Windows API in C++ form. Library classes represent windows,
dialog boxes, device contexts, common GDI objects, and other standard
Windows items. These classes provide a convenient C++ member function
interface to the structures in Windows that they encapsulate. The
Microsoft Foundation Class Library also supplies a layer of additional
application functionality built on the C++ encapsulation of the Windows
API. This layer is a working application framework for Windows that
provides most of the common user interface expected of programs for
Windows.
<P>
The single characteristic that sets the Microsoft Foundation Class Library
apart from other class libraries for Windows is the close mapping to the
Windows API written in the C language. You can generally mix calls to the
class library freely with direct calls to the Windows API. However, the
classes are not a complete replacement for that API. Developers must still
occasionally make direct calls to some Windows functions
(::GetSystemMetrics, for example). A Windows function is wrapped by a
class member function only when there is a clear advantage to doing so.
