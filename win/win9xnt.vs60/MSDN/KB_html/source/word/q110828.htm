Questions and Answers:  5.1a Patch
 

<PRE>1. Q. What is the Word 5.1a patch and what does it do?

   A. The 5.1a patch corrects a problem with Word 5.1 that causes the
      footers and/or headers to disappear or change. This will happen in
      the last section (or only section) of a document when it is fast
      saved.

2. Q. Does this problem affect all copies of Word 5.1 that have been
      distributed? How can I tell which version I own?

   A. The problem affects only those copies of Word 5.1 that were
      manufactured prior to November 4, 1992. When run, the patcher program
      changes the product version to 5.1a and the date to November 4, 1992.

      You can check your version in one of the following two ways:

      a. While in Microsoft Word 5.1, click on the Apple menu and select
         About Microsoft Word. If the version is 5.1a, and the date is
         November 4, 1992, your version has been fixed. Otherwise the patch
         is needed.

      b. While at the Finder level, click on the Microsoft Word application
         icon, so that it is selected, and choose Get Info from the File
         menu. If 5.1a is listed beside Version, your program has been
         updated. If this is not listed, the patch is still needed.

3. Q. Can I prevent the problem from occurring before the patcher is run?

   A. To prevent the problem from occurring before the patcher is run, turn
      the Fast Save option off:

      a. From the Tools menu, select Preferences.

      b. In the Preferences box, select the Open And Save category.

      c. Clear the Fast Save check box.

      If the problem has already occurred, running the patcher program or
      turning Fast Save off will not restore the headers and footers. They
      will have to be retyped.

4. Q. How can I obtain the Word 5.1a Patch

   A. If you have a modem, the fastest way to obtain the Word 5.1a patch is
      from the Microsoft Product Support download service, at
      (425) 936-6735. For complete instructions on how to access and use
      the Microsoft download service, return to the Word 5.1 main menu and
      select number 8. You can also obtain the Word 5.1a patch by mail.

      To obtain the Word 5.1a patch by mail, press 1.
