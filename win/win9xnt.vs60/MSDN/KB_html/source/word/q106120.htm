The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a Word version 1.x or 2.x for Windows document in the
versions of Microsoft Word listed above, Word converts table Expression (=)
fields to Formula fields and converts relative table cell references to
absolute references. For information on how Word 6.0 and grater exports the
same formula fields, see the EXPORT section below.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Word versions 1.x and 2.x use a different notation for referencing table
cells than Word 6.0 and greater. Word 1.x and 2.x use a notation row column
number reference such as: R1C1 or R3C2. Beginning with Word
6.0, the notation is the same as Excel's, for example: A1 or B3. Below is a
sample Expression field as it appears in Word 1.x or 2.x:
<P>
<PRE>   {=SUM([R1C1])*SUM([R1C4])}

</PRE>Word 6.0 and greater converts the above Expression field to the following
Formula field:
<P>
<PRE>   {=SUM(A1)*SUM(D1)}

</PRE>In Word 6.0 and greater, you can simplify your Formula field calculations
so they no longer use the SUM operator. For example, you can rewrite the
above Formula field as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   {=A1*D1}

</PRE>Both Formula fields produce the same result.
<P>
<P><h3>Export</h3>
 
<P>
If a document is saved in a Word 1.x or 2.x format from versions of
Microsoft Word listed above, these absolute references are not re-converted
to a Word 1.x or 2.0x format.
<P>
For example, when a Word 2.0 document that contains the formula
{=sum([r1c1:r1c3])} is imported into Word 6.0, the formula
{=sum([r1c1:r1c3])} appears as {=SUM(A1:C3)}.  The Word 2.0 formula is
converted to Word 6.0 format.
<P>
However, when a Word 6.0 document that contains the formula {=SUM(A1:C3)}
is exported from Word 6.0 in Word 2.0 format and opened in Word 2.0,
{=SUM(A1:C3)} appears as {=SUM(A1:C3)}.  The Word 6.0 formula is not
converted to the Word 2.0 format of {=sum([r1c1:r1c3])}.  The correct field
result (the sum of the cells) is retained until the formula field is
updated at which point a "!Syntax error" is received.
<P>
When a Word 6.0 document that contains the formula {=SUM(A1:C3)} is
exported from Word 6.0 in Word 6.0 format and opened in Word 2.0,
{=SUM(A1:C3)} appears as {= }; The Word 6.0 formula doesn't retain the Word
6.0 format of {=SUM(A1:C3)} or convert to the Word 2.0 format of
{=sum([r1c1:r1c3])}.  The correct field result (the sum of the cells) is
retained until the formula field is updated at which point an "!Unexpected
End of Expression" is received.
<P>
WORKAROUND: Unlink the fields before they're updated to retain the original
field results.  Do this by placing the Insertion Point in the formula field
and pressing CTRL+SHIFT+F9, the Unlink Fields key combination.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the versions of Microsoft
Word listed above. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here as it becomes available.
