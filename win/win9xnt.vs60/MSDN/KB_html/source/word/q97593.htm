The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0a-CD, 2.0b,
   2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The # of Words value in the Document Statistics dialog box is
incorrect after you choose the Update button if your Word for Windows
document contains more than 65,536 words. Before you choose the Update
button for the first time in your document, Word lists an estimated
word count value, which is correct, even if your document contains
more than 65,536 words.
<P>
The updated # of Words value is incorrect because the function that
updates the # of Words statistic is limited to 16 bits, which means
that the largest number it can calculate is 2 to the 16th power, or
65,536. If your document contains more than 65,536 words, Word
restarts the counter at one (1) the first time you choose the Update
button in the Document Statistics dialog box. For example, if your
document contains 65,537 words, the # of Words value is 1 after you
choose the Update button; if your document contains 65,736 words, the
updated # of Words value is 200, and so forth.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the versions of
Microsoft Word for Windows listed above. This problem was corrected in Word
version 7.0 for Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To open the Document Statistics dialog box, choose Summary Info from
the File menu and choose the Statistics button. If the # of Words
label is unavailable (dimmed), the Update button has not yet been
chosen in this document.
<P>
The updated # of Words value is accurate in documents that contain
fewer than 65,537 words. To obtain an accurate word count in larger
documents after you update the Document Statistics dialog box, you can
create a WordBasic macro to count the words in your document. For
information on such a macro, query on the following words in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   count and text and selection and macro and winword

</PRE>Note: The NUMWORDS field returns the # of Words value, so the NUMWORDS
field is incorrect whenever the # of Words value is incorrect.
