<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When accessing SQL Server with integrated security from Active Server Pages
(ASP) there are some limitations that you should be aware of when designing
your Web site. This article gives a high-level overview of these
limitations and describes possible workarounds.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft SQL Server Integrated Security requires NTLM authentication in
order to map user accounts to SQL Server accounts. This process requires
that a token be created during the authentication process. This token
requires a the user password to create a private encryption key. Because of
this, the token can only be created on a domain controller or the logged on
user's machine. Also note that Windows NT 4.0 does not allow the forwarding
of such tokens.
<P>
With these points in mind you can see that after a Web browser is
authenticated by Internet Information Server (IIS), an authenticated
connection to the SQL Server is not possible. At this point when IIS
attempts to connect to SQL Server via NTLM, IIS does not have the necessary
information to complete the NT authentication process.
<P>
There are a couple possible workarounds to this limitation:
<P>
<P><h3>Host IIS and SQL Server on the Same Machine</h3>
 
<P>
By eliminating the need for IIS to create an authenticated connection to
SQL Server, you can work around this problem. To do this you must use a
data source name (DSN) that does not look out to the network for the SQL
Server and instead looks directly to the local machine. This can be done by
using the "(local)" setting in a System DSN.
<P>
<P><h3>Use Basic Authentication Instead of NTLM in IIS</h3>
 
<P>
By using Basic authentication, the password is BASE64 encoded and sent to
IIS during the authentication process. With the password, IIS can now
complete the NTLM authentication process when connection to SQL Server.
<P>
NOTE: This method is not secure. BASE64 encoded passwords can be decrypted
by anyone able to sniff network packets over the Internet or intranet.
<P>
<P><h3>Map the Anonymous User Account from IIS to a SQL Server Guest Account</h3>
 
<P>
This method assumes that all users will have the same level of privileges
to the SQL Server resources. This method is most often the LEAST acceptable
option.
