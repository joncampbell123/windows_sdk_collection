<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
This article lists the most common problems encountered when using the
Setup Wizard and describes how to avoid or solve them. Much of this
information comes from the Setup Wizard Help file (Setupwiz.hlp) which is
accessible from the Tips button in the Setup Wizard.

</UL><h3>Setup Wizard Error Message Occurs When You Attempt to Create Disk Images</h3>
 
<P>
You may see the following error message when you try to create disk images
for your application using the Setup Wizard:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup Wizard
   Permission Denied

</PRE>After you see this error message, you'll see the error message "The
creation of your custom Setup program was not completed successfully."
This error occurs if you specify a workgroup information (.mdw) file for
your application that is the same workgroup information file being used for
the current instance of Microsoft Access. You specify a workgroup
information file on the Add Files page of the Setup Wizard, using the "Set
As Workgroup File" check box.
<P>
To avoid this error message, create a copy of the workgroup information
file, and use this copy as the workgroup information file for your
application.
<P>
NOTE: You will also see the same error message if you try to add any file
to your custom application that is currently in use by Microsoft Access or
another application.
<P>
<P><h3>"Object Error 325" Occurs While Your Custom Setup Program Is Running</h3>
 
<P>
To avoid this error, always change the version number of your application
each time you change the files included in the Setup program. In addition,
make sure you use a different name for each application you create.
<P>
Default Installation Folder for Your Application Is Always on Drive C
 
<P>
When a user sets up your application, your custom Setup program suggests a
default folder for the application's installation. You set the default
folder that is suggested on the Provide Application Details page of the
Setup Wizard.
<P>
You can enter any folder path you want, but note that the custom Setup
program will always suggest the first available hard drive, typically drive
C, as the root for this path. Your users can choose to use another location
for the application's installation.
<P>
<P><h3>You Receive a Compile Error When You Run Your Run-Time Application</h3>
 
<P>
If your run-time application uses methods, properties, or functions in a
referenced database, your application must include the referenced
database, or you must remove the methods, properties, or functions from
your run-time application.
<P>
You can check to see if your run-time application uses such methods,
properties, or functions by running your application in full Microsoft
Access. The References dialog box on the Tools menu lists any referenced
databases. You can add such databases to your application's custom Setup
program by using the Add Files page in the Setup Wizard.
<P>
<P><h3>Users Can't Run Microsoft Graph 97 from Your Run-Time Application</h3>
 
<P>
After uninstalling an Office application, users of your application may
receive an error message saying the application can't find the dynamic-link
library (DLL) Mso97 when they try to run Graph from within your
application. To correct this problem, they need to reinstall your
application.
<P>
<P><h3>Can't Run a Run-Time Application Without a Network Server or CD-ROM</h3>
 
<P>
If users have installed Microsoft Office Professional 97 or Microsoft
Access 97 on a network server or on a CD-ROM (that is, they don't have a
full local version of Microsoft Access), installing your custom run-time
application on their computer does not install a local version of
Microsoft Access. So, in order to run your run-time application, users
must be connected to the network server or have the CD-ROM available.
To work around this problem, users can uninstall both Microsoft Office
Professional 97 or Microsoft Access 97 and your run-time application, and
then reinstall them, making sure to install your run-time application
first.
<P>
<P><h3>Database (.Mdb) Files No Longer Automatically Open in Microsoft Access</h3>
 
<P>
After uninstalling Microsoft Access, users of your run-time application
may find that .mdb files no longer automatically open in Microsoft Access
even though the run-time version of Microsoft Access is still installed on
their computers.
<P>
To work around this problem, users can either reinstall your application
or manually add an association between .mdb files and Msaccess.exe. To
keep this problem from occurring, make sure you include "Msaccess.exe" in
the command line for the shortcut that opens your application (for
example, "Msaccess.exe" /runtime "$(FilePath)\MyApp.mdb").
<P>
<P><h3>Users Can't Open the Custom Help File for Your Run-Time Application</h3>
 
<P>
If users of your run-time application are prompted to open the Microsoft
Access Help file instead of your custom Help file, you need to create and
set the AppHelpFile key in the Windows registry under the Run-Time Options
key. For more information about creating these keys, see Microsoft Access
Run-Time Option Settings.
<P>
You Must Use Either Full or No File Name Extensions for Compressed Files
 
<P>
If you create disk images for your application in compressed format (you
select 1.44-MB Disks or Compressed Network or CD Setup on the Specify Disk
Image Options page in the Setup Wizard), you must either use full
three-letter file name extensions (for example, MyApp.mdb) or use no
extension (for example, Readme) for any files you specify for your
application. If you don't, you will receive a "Setup could not open the
file 'filename'" error when you are running the custom Setup program for
your application.
<P>
<P><h3>Open Disk Image Folders and Highlight All Files When Copying Files to Disks</h3>
 
<P>
When copying files from the disk images for your application to 1.44-MB
disks, you must open each folder in the disk images set and highlight all
the files in the folder before copying its files to the disks. The default
folder for your disk images is c:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\
ODETools\Setup Wizard\Images\Disks. This folder will contain
folders named Disk1, Disk2, and so on. To copy the files in the Disk1
folder, open this folder and highlight all the files before copying the
folder to floppy disks. Repeat this procedure for all the other disk
folders.
<P>
You should also make sure the .dll files for your application are visible
in the disk images before you copy the files. By default, Microsoft
Windows 95 hides .dll files in Windows Explorer.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating Front-End/Back-End Applications</h3>
 
<P>
The Setup Wizard does not support administrative installations using the /a
switch when installing Microsoft Access run-time applications. That is,
you cannot install a main application containing all of your data and
database objects on a server, and then from that server installation
install "front-end" applications containing just the queries, forms,
reports, macros, and modules on workstation computers.
<P>
To simulate this functionality, you should create two applications. Create
one application that contains all of the data and database objects you
want in your application (this is called a "main" or "back-end"
application). Create another application that contains just the queries,
forms, reports, macros, and modules from the main application (this is
called a "front-end" application). In this application, include links to
the data in the main application. Use the Setup Wizard to create a custom
Setup program containing two components. One component contains the main
application. You can specify that this component is only available in a
Complete or Custom installation. The second component, available in a
Typical installation, contains the front-end application. Administrators
can then run your custom Setup program and install the main application on
a network server. Users can run your custom Setup program and install the
front-end application on a local computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Specify a Unique Application Name, Version Number, and Destination Folder</h3>
 
<P>
When you create an application's custom Setup program using the Setup
Wizard, be sure to specify a unique application name, version number, and
destination folder for the application in the Provide Application Details
page of the Setup Wizard. For example, it is usually a bad idea to install
an application in the same folder as Microsoft Access; file names in your
application could conflict with existing Microsoft Access file names.
