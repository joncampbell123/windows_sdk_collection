When you try to open a form in Filter-by-Form view programmatically
in a Microsoft Access 97 run-time application, you may receive the
following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '2501':
   The RunCommand action was canceled.

</PRE>followed by:
<P>
<PRE>   Execution of this application has stopped due to a run-time error.
   The application can't continue and will be shut down.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Filter-by-Form commands are unavailable in a Microsoft Access 97
run-time application.

   TITLE     : ACC97: Filter-by-Form Example for Run-Time Apps Available
               on MSL

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Access 7.0, Filter-by-Form works in both the full version and
the run-time version. However, the Filter-by-Form functionality wasn't
designed to be available in a Microsoft Access 7.0 run-time application.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
CAUTION: Following these steps will modify the sample database
Northwind.mdb. You may want to back up the Northwind.mdb file and
perform these steps on a copy of the database.

<OL><P><LI>Open the sample database Northwind.mdb, and open the Customers form in
   Design view.

<P><LI>Add a command button to the form.

<P><LI>Change the Name property for the command button to btnFilter.

<P><LI>Place the following code in the OnClick event procedure of the command
   button:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Private Sub btnFilter_Click()
<PRE></PRE>         DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdFilterByForm
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Close and save the form.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Startup.

<P><LI>Under Display Form, select Customers from the list, and then click
   OK.

<P><LI>On the Start menu, click Run, and then type the following command.
<P>
   NOTE: In the following sample, an underscore (_) at the end of a line
   is used as a line-continuation character. Remove the underscore from
   the end of the line when typing this command.
<P>
   NOTE: In the following sample, replace C:\Program Files\Microsoft
   Office\Office\ with the path to where Msaccess.exe is located on your
   hard drive.
<P>
<P><PRE>      "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Msaccess.exe" _
      "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Samples\Northwind.mdb" _
      /Runtime
</PRE>
<P><LI>When the Customers form opens, click the button that you created in step
   2.
<P>
   Note that the filter-by-form view does not come up, and you receive the
   errors listed in the "Symptoms" section.
