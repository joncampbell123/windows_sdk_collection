<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
This article describes the new features of the Microsoft Office 97
Developer Edition Tools (ODE Tools) compared to its predecessor, Microsoft
Access Developer's Toolkit, version 7.0 (ADT 7.0).
<P>
For a list of features included with Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit,
version 7.0, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../accother/q136130.htm">Q136130</A></B>
   TITLE     : ADT95: Overview of MS Access Developer's Toolkit (ADT)

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
ODE Tools offer the following new features compared with ADT 7.0:
<P>
<P><h3>Setup Wizard</h3>
 

<UL><LI>A new Tips button on the initial screen of the Setup Wizard helps you
   avoid common problems and mistakes creating setup images with the
   Wizard.

<LI>The ODE Tools Setup Wizard supports the use of dependency files (.dep),
   which makes it easier to redistribute ActiveX controls by automatically
   including required ActiveX support files with your application.
<P>
</UL><h3>New ActiveX Controls</h3>
 

<UL><LI>The Animation control allows you to create buttons on your forms that
   display animation (.avi files).

<LI>The Winsock control provides access to Transfer Control Protocol (TCP)
   and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to allow you to stream data between two
   computers using TCP/IP protocol.

<LI>The Internet Transfer control provides access to HTTP and FTP Internet
   protocols so you can connect to World Wide Web servers to retrieve HTML
   documents and upload or download files on FTP servers.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: The Data Outline control is not included with Microsoft Office 97
Developer Edition Tools; however, an updated control for Microsoft Access
97 is available free from the Microsoft Software Library. For information
about obtaining the updated Data Outline control, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../access/q162359.htm">Q162359</A></B>
   TITLE     : ACC97: Access 97 Data Outline ActiveX Control Available on
               MSL

</PRE><h3>Replication Manager</h3>
 

<UL><LI>The ODE Tools Replication Manager allows synchronization via the
   Internet or an intranet.

<LI>You can use Synchronizers (formerly Transporters) to synchronize
   replicated databases directly if both replicas to be synchronized can
   be opened at the same time. Using a Synchronizer to manage a network
   dropbox folder for indirect synchronization is still an option.

<LI>Improved user interface allows you to view any replicated database in
   the Synchronization window. You can also see the status and history of
   replicas managed by other Synchronizers or replicas that are not managed
   by any Synchronizer.
<P>
</UL><h3>Source Code Control</h3>
 

<UL><LI>ODE Tools supports the use of version control (also known as source code
   control) software, such as Microsoft Visual SourceSafe version 5.0.
   Version control software gives developers the ability to track and
   maintain changes within their source code, and is often used on projects
   where multiple programmers work on source code simultaneously.
<P>
</UL><h3>Other New Features</h3>
 

<UL><LI>The Microsoft ODE Tools Sampler contains technical information and code
   samples from the Microsoft Developer Network.

<LI>The Replication Manager White Paper discusses how to create and manage
   replicated databases.

<LI>The Source Code Control White Paper provides an overview of the source
   code control component of ODE Tools.

<LI>Improved Help Workshop for creating custom Help files for your
   application.

<LI>Microsoft Office 97 Visual Basic Programmer's Guide and Building
   Applications with Microsoft Access 97 user manuals.
