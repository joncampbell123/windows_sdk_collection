The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you install a custom application created with the Microsoft Access
Developer's Toolkit (ADT), you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup couldn't create a SYSTEM.MDA file. After Setup is completed,
   reboot your computer, then run the Workgroup Administrator before
   you run this application. (-1809)

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if no form of file sharing (SHARE.EXE, VSHARE.386, or
network locking) is running when the Workgroup Administrator (WRKGADM.EXE)
tries to create a SYSTEM.MDA file. In order for the Workgroup Administrator
to be able to create the SYSTEM.MDA file, some form of file sharing must be
running.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two workarounds for this problem:

<UL><LI>Ship a SYSTEM.MDA file with your custom application. To do this, add the
   SYSTEM.MDA file in the Files To Include box in the ADT Setup Wizard.
   This way, the Workgroup Administrator does not need to create a
   SYSTEM.MDA file. Note that the file must be named SYSTEM.MDA in order
   for this workaround to work. No other name (such as MYSYS.MDA) will
   work.

<LI>Test to see if some form of file sharing is running before starting the
   custom Setup program. You can test to see if file sharing is running in
   a number of ways. To test for file sharing in Microsoft Windows, you can
   start the MS-DOS prompt and then type "share" (without quotation marks).
   If file sharing is running, you will receive a message stating "SHARE
   already installed." You can also test for file sharing with a small
   Microsoft Visual Basic or Microsoft Visual C application (these
   applications are not discussed in this article).
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Access
Developer's Toolkit version 2.0. This problem no longer occurs in the
Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit version 7.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create application disks using the ADT Setup Wizard. Do not include
   a SYSTEM.MDA file with your application.

<P><LI>Install your application on a computer that is not running some form
   of file sharing (either loading SHARE.EXE in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file or
   loading VSHARE.386 in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file).
   Note that you receive the error message mentioned earlier in this
   article.
