The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you run the Setup Wizard in Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit
version 7.0 to create Setup files for your custom application that contains
OLE Controls, and then you run Setup for your application on another
computer, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Mfc40.dll was unable to register itself in the system registry.

</PRE>When you click OK, you receive an error message that Setup was not
completed successfully.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Your application's Setup files contain a mismatched version of the
Msvcrt40.dll file. The size of the mismatched file is approximately 65
kilobytes, or 65,000 bytes. The size may vary slightly depending on the
program that supplied it.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, follow these steps:

<UL><LI>Rename your existing Msvcrt40.dll file in the Windows System folder.

<LI>Restore a compatible version of Msvcrt40.dll to the Windows System
   folder on your development computer from your original Microsoft Access
   for Windows 95 media.

<LI>Rerun the Setup Wizard to create new Setup files.
<P>
   NOTE: In some circumstances, Msvcrt40.dll may be in use and you will not
   be able to rename it from within Microsoft Windows. If that happens,
   follow these steps:

<LI>Restore the Msvcrt40.dll from the original Microsoft Access media to a
   temporary folder on your hard drive.

<LI>Start your computer to an MS-DOS command prompt.

<LI>Use the MS-DOS Rename command to rename the Msvcrt40.dll file in your
   Windows System folder.

<LI>Move the restored Msvcrt40.dll file from its temporary folder to the
   Windows System folder.

<LI>Restart your computer.
<P>
</UL>You can find the correct 312,832 byte version of Msvcrt40.dll in one of the
following locations:
<P>
<PRE>   Product              Media          Location     CAB File Name
   --------------------------------------------------------------

   Microsoft Office     Compact Disc   \OS\System   N/A
   Professional for
   Windows 95

   Microsoft Office     Diskettes      Disk 2       Msoff2.cab
   Professional for
   Windows 95

   Microsoft Access     Diskettes      Disk 2       Access2.cab
   for Windows 95

</PRE>If you have Microsoft Office 95 Professional for Windows 95 or Microsoft
Access for Windows 95 on diskettes, the files are stored in a compressed
file format called cabinet files (.cab). You must use the Extract.exe
utility on Disk 1 to decompress and restore the Msvcrt40.dll file to your
computer. For more information about using Extract.exe, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Setup for some software programs, such as Visual C++, ActiveX
SDK, and Windows NT version 4.0, the program installs a smaller, debug
version of Msvcrt40.dll on your computer. Because that version of the file
is newer than the one included with Microsoft Office Professional for
Windows 95 or Microsoft Access for Windows 95, the Setup program does not
overwrite it if you reinstall Microsoft Access. You must restore the
correct version of the file manually from the original media.
<P>
Msvcrt40.dll is one of three files you must include with the Setup files
for your custom application if your application uses OLE custom controls.
The other two files are Mfc40.dll and Olepro32.dll.
