The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit versions 2.0, 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you run a custom application that you created with the Microsoft
Office 97 Developer Edition Tools or the Microsoft Access Developer's
Toolkit, you receive a compile error. The same application runs correctly
when you run it with the retail version of Microsoft Access.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This compile error will occur in Microsoft Access 97 or Microsoft Access
for Windows 95 version 7.0 if your application uses methods or properties
in a referenced database that has not been included in the application
distribution set or if Microsoft Access cannot establish a valid
reference. (Wizards in Microsoft Access 97 and in Microsoft Access 7.0
are shipped in a compiled state and cannot be referenced.)
<P>
A similar error can occur in Microsoft Access version 2.0 if you make a
reference in your application's code to functions or variables defined
in the WZLIB.MDA file (which cannot be legally distributed with your
application), or to any other library database that is not loaded in
your application.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Remove or modify the code in your application that refers to the WZLIB.MDA
file, or to any other file that is not referenced (in Microsoft Access 97
and 7.0) or not loaded (in version 2.0).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Access 97 and Microsoft Access 7.0</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Access 97 and Microsoft Access 7.0 run-time environment uses
the same executable file (Msaccess.exe) as the full Microsoft Access
environment. To test the run-time application on a computer with full
Microsoft Access installed, start the application using the run-time switch
on the command line. For example, the following command line starts
Microsoft Access and opens the Northwind sample database in the run-time
environment.
<P>
NOTE: In the following example, an underscore (_) at the end of a line
is used as a line-continuation character. Remove the underscore from the
end of the line when re-creating this example.
<P>
Microsoft Access 97:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\MSAccess.exe /Runtime _
   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Samples\Northwind.mdb

</PRE>Microsoft Access 7.0:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\MSOffice\Access\MSAccess.exe /Runtime C:\MSOffice\Access\Samples_
   \Northwind.mdb

</PRE>If a compile error occurs on one computer but not when opened as a run-time
application on the development computer, you may have referenced methods or
procedures contained in a file that you failed to distribute.
<P>
To check the references that are available on the development computer,
open the application in full Microsoft Access. On the View menu, click Code
to open a code module. On the View menu, click Object Browser. If the drop
down list labeled Libraries/Databases contains a custom database and if you
have used a function, method, or property from it, you must distribute that
custom database with your application.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Access Version 2.0</h3>
 
<P>
The WZLIB.MDA library database contains routines and utilities used by the
Microsoft Access Wizards and by other code. For example, the Reattach NWIND
module in the SOLUTION.MDB database (a sample database shipped with
Microsoft Access version 2.0) includes a function that refers to WZLIB.MDA.
<P>
If you include code in your application that refers to the WZLIB.MDA file,
and then run your application with the retail version of Microsoft Access,
the application will run correctly. However, if you run the Setup Wizard to
create distribution disks for your application, and correctly modify the
initialization (.INI) file for the application to remove the Wizard files
from the [Libraries] section, you will receive a compile error when you run
the application as a run-time application. Note that error-trapping
routines that you may have included in your code will not be called,
because these routines cannot trap compile errors.
<P>
To discover which section of your code is causing the compile error, run
your application with the retail version of Microsoft Access, but with your
application's custom .INI file. For example, to run an application called
MYAPP.MDB with a custom .INI file called MYAPP.INI, create an icon with the
following command line.
<P>
NOTE: This example assumes that you have Microsoft Access installed in the
ACCESS directory on drive C, and that the MYAPP.MDB application is in the
MYAPP directory on drive C.
<P>
<PRE>   C:\ACCESS\MSACCESS.EXE C:\MYAPP\MYAPP.MDB /INI C:\MYAPP\MYAPP.INI

</PRE>This command will run the MYAPP.MDB application with only the libraries
specified in the [Libraries] section of the custom MYAPP.INI file. Compile
your application's code at this point to locate the cause of the compile
error.
<P>
NOTE: If you open a module in Design view and then choose Compile Loaded
Modules from the Run menu, code in any form or report modules will not be
compiled. To compile code in form and report modules, the forms and reports
must be open in Design view.
