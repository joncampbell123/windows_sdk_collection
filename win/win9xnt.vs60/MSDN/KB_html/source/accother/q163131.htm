The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you remove Microsoft Replication Manager 3.5 from your computer, and
then reinstall it, you may receive the following message when you start
Replication Manager:
<P>
<PRE>   The managed replica '&lt;Path and Filename&gt;' doesn't exist or isn't
   accessible.

</PRE>This message may appear if you have installed Replication Manager from the
Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools (ODE Tools), or from a
Microsoft Access 97 run-time application that includes Replication Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you remove Microsoft Replication Manager 3.5 from your computer, the
Windows Registry keys that store information about managed replicas remain.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
When you see the message described in the "Symptoms" section, you are also
prompted with the question "Would you like to remove it from the list of
managed replicas?" If the managed replica no longer exists, click Yes to
remove it from the managed replica list. If the replica is temporarily
inaccessible, and you still want to manage it with Replication Manager,
click No.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Office 97
Developer Edition Tools. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The message is the same one that you see any time you start Microsoft
Replication Manager and it cannot find a managed replica. However, when
you remove Replication Manager from your computer, you might expect
information about which replica databases it managed to be removed also.
<P>
If you install Microsoft Replication Manager 3.5 as part of ODE Tools
Setup, remove it, and then reinstall it again later, the replicas that it
previously managed may still exist. If those replicas are accessible when
you start Replication Manager, you won't even see the message; the
replicas will automatically appear in Replication Manager's managed
replica list.
<P>
If you have Replication Manager on your computer as part of a run-time
application, and you remove that application, the information about the
managed replicas remains in the Windows Registry. If you later install
another run-time application that includes Replication Manager, the
original managed replica displayed in the message no longer exists on your
computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Set up and configure Replication Manager on your computer.

<P><LI>Add at least one managed replica to Replication Manager.

<P><LI>Remove Replication Manager from your computer.

<P><LI>Move, rename, or delete the managed replica.

<P><LI>Reinstall Replication Manager, and then start it. Note that you receive
   the message as Replication Manager looks for the replicas it managed in
   its previous installation.
<P>
</OL><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
