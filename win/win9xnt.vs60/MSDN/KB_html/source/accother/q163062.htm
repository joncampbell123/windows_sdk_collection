The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you run the Setup program for your custom application that includes a
file to execute after Setup, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Failed to launch process:
   Setup has encountered a problem in launching the following command line:
   &lt;Path and Filename&gt;.
   If you have a system directory that contains a % sign, or the directory
   name *starts* with a space (i.e. 'C:\win95\system'), then setup will
   fail. Please restart setup and ensure that your system directory name
   does not contain the aforementioned problems. Setup will now abort.

</PRE>After you click OK, you receive an additional message:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;Application Name&gt; Setup was not completed successfully.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message occurs if the file name you execute at the end of your
Setup program is not an executable file (*.exe, *.com, *.pif, *.bat).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Follow these steps if you want to execute a file at the end of Setup that
is not actually an executable file:

<OL><P><LI>Include the file you want to run along with the rest of your setup
   files. For example, include your custom Readme.txt if you want to open
   it at the end of your Setup program.

<P><LI>If necessary, include the executable file that runs your custom file.
   For example, do not include Notepad.exe to open a Readme.txt
   file because it is not on the list of files you can distribute with
   your application, and because any Windows computer where you set up your
   application already has that file.
<P>
   NOTE: If you plan to include any Microsoft executable file, be sure it
   is a file you are licensed to distribute with your application. For
   example, you can include the Word Viewer or PowerPoint Viewer files if
   you want to include a shortcut to a Microsoft Word or Microsoft
   PowerPoint file with your application. These are royalty-free viewer
   programs.
<P>
   For more information about the files you can include with your custom
   application, search the Help Index for "files, distributing with
   run-time applications."
<P>
   The Word Viewer and PowerPoint Viewer are included in the Microsoft
   Office 97 ValuPack. For more information about the viewers, open the
   Valupk8.hlp file, located in the ValuPack folder on your Microsoft
   Access 97 or Microsoft Office 97 compact disc.

<P><LI>In the "Run the following file after the Setup program is completed" box
   on the "Do you want to run an executable file" screen of the Setup
   Wizard, select the name of the file you want to open after Setup, such
   as Readme.txt.

<P><LI>Customize the "Enter or edit the command line" box on the "Do you want
   to run an executable file" screen of the Setup Wizard to reflect the
   command line to open the file, and not just the file name itself. For
   example, type the following command line to open Readme.txt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      "$(WinPath)\Notepad.exe" "$(AppPath)\Readme.txt"
</PRE><P>
   The following sample command line starts the Setup program for the Word
   Viewer.
<P>
<P><PRE>      "$(AppPath)\Wd95vw71.exe"
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: When you include any executable that runs its own Setup program,
   such as Wd95vw71.exe, you must click the "Allow Setup to Complete Before
   the file Finishes Running" box on the "Do you want to run an executable
   file" screen of the Setup Wizard. This allows your custom Setup program
   to complete before the next Setup program begins.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start the ODE Tools Setup Wizard.

<P><LI>On the opening screen of the Setup Wizard, click "Create a new set of
   setup options for my application's custom Setup program," and then
   click Next.

<P><LI>On the "Add the files" screen of the Setup Wizard, click the Add button
   and add the sample database Northwind.mdb. Click to select the "Set as
   Application's Main File" check box.

<P><LI>Click the Add button again and add the Microsoft Access Readme file,
   Acread80.wri, which is installed by default in the \Program
   Files\Microsoft Office\Office folder. Click Next.

<P><LI>On the "Add the Shortcuts" screen of the Setup Wizard, click the Add
   button and select Northwind.mdb. Type NWTest in the Description box,
   and then click Next.

<P><LI>Continue to click Next until you get to the "Do you want to run an
   executable file" screen of the Setup Wizard. Select Acread80.wri in the
   "Run the following file after the Setup program is completed" box, and
   then click Next.

<P><LI>On the "Where do you want the Setup Wizard to copy the files" screen,
   specify a folder where you want to create the setup image. Under "What
   kind of distribution disks do you want to create?", click the Network or
   CD Setup box and click to clear the 1.44-MB Disks check box if it is
   selected. Click Finish.

<P><LI>When prompted if you want to save the Setup template, you can click No.
   The Setup Wizard proceeds to create the setup image.

<P><LI>Run the Setup program from the folder containing the setup image.
   Accept all defaults on the Setup screens and note that you receive the
   error message before Setup is finished.
