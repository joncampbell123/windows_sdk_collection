The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you insert an ActiveX control that shipped with the Microsoft Office
97 Developer Edition (ODE) Tools, or when you attempt to access the
properties of the ActiveX control, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   You don't have the license required to use this ActiveX control.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Before you installed the ODE Tools, you installed an application that uses
run-time versions of the ActiveX controls. If more recent versions of the
files for these controls already existed on your computer when you
installed the ODE Tools, the ActiveX control (.ocx) files were not updated.
As a result, the corresponding dependency (.dep) files were not installed,
and registry entries required to give the controls design-time
functionality were not made.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use either of the following methods to resolve the problem, but
Method 1 is the recommended resolution.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Download the Odelic.exe file from the Microsoft Software Library.
<P>
<PRE> ~ <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/odelic.exe">Odelic.exe</A> <I>(size: 815840 bytes)</I> 

   is a self-extracting executable file, which contains the following
   files:

   OdeOcxFx.exe    Office Developer Edition ActiveX Control Update
   Readme.txt      Readme file

</PRE>Running OdeOcxFx.exe provides you with a design-time license to the ActiveX
controls that ship with the ODE; it updates the registry and copies the
.dep files onto your computer if they do not already exist.
<P>
For more information about downloading files from the Microsoft Software
Library, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

</PRE><h3>Method 2</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Rename Comctl32.ocx, Comdlg32.ocx, and Richtx32.ocx, which are files
   that are located in the Windows\System folder.

<P><LI>Rename the Setup.stf file in the ODETools\Setup folder; the default
   location of this folder is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office.

<P><LI>Reinstall the ODE Tools.

<P><LI>Replace Comctl32.ocx, Comdlg32.ocx, and Richtx32.ocx with the original
   files that you renamed in Step 1.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Office 97
Developer Edition Tools. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Scenarios in which this problem can occur include, but are not limited to:

<OL><P><LI>Installation of the ODE Tools after you have installed the
   Exchange/Outlook Wizard, which uses Comctl32.ocx.

<P><LI>Installation of the ODE Tools after you have installed a custom
   application that uses a run-time version of one of the ActiveX controls.
   The custom application was developed in Microsoft Visual Basic version
   5.0, Microsoft Visual C++ version 4.0, or Microsoft Visual FoxPro
   version 5.0.

<P><LI>Installation of the ODE Tools after you have installed a custom
   application that uses a run-time version of one of the ActiveX controls.
   Microsoft Visual Basic version 5.0, Microsoft Visual C++ version 4.0, or
   Microsoft Visual FoxPro version 5.0 is installed on the development
   computer, and the Setup Wizard included with the ODE Tools was used to
   package the custom application.
