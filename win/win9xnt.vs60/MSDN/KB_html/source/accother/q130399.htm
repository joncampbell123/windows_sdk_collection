The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
If you use the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit (ADT) in Microsoft
Windows 95 to create a custom Setup program and distribution disks for
Your application, users who install your application on computers running
Windows version 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.11 receive the following
error messages:

<UL><LI>During the application's custom Setup program:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;Application name&gt; Setup not completed successfully
</PRE>
<LI>When an OLE object is selected:
<P>
<P><PRE>      There is a problem initializing MSAOLE20.DLL
</PRE><P>
</UL>Also, the following problems occur:

<UL><LI>No program group is created in Program Manager for the application.

<LI>No SYSTEM.MDA file is created for the application.

<LI>Embedded OLE objects appear empty or blank.

<LI>File Manager, Microsoft Office, and other programs may generate the
   following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>     This application requires a newer version of Windows.
</PRE>
<LI>Microsoft Access version 2.0 (MSACCESS.EXE) generates the following
   error message when you start the application:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Couldn't open VER.DLL.
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The ADT Setup Wizard copies several system files to the Setup disks.
If you create the disks with Windows 95, but the disks are then used to
install your application on a computer running Windows 3.1 or Windows
for Workgroups 3.11, the Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.11
system files are replaced by their Windows 95 equivalents. This can
affect the following system files:
<P>
<PRE>   COMPOBJ.DLL
   OLE2.DLL
   OLE2.REG
   OLE2DISP.DLL
   OLE2NLS.DLL
   STDOLE.TLB
   STORAGE.DLL
   TYPELIB.DLL
   VER.DLL

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid this behavior, run the ADT Setup Wizard on a computer running
Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.11, if you plan to distribute
your application to anyone running those operating sytems. There is no
workaround available that will allow you to create your disk images on
a computer running Windows 95 and then distribute them on a computer
running Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.11.
<P>
NOTE: If you use the ADT Setup Wizard with Windows 3.1 or Windows for
Workgroups 3.11, you can create custom applications that install and run
successfully on computers running Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups
3.11, or Windows 95.
<P>
NOTE: The above behavior does not apply to the applications that you
create with Microsoft Access 2.0 on Windows 95 computers. You can design
your applications with Microsoft Access 2.0 on computers running Windows
95 and distribute the application to other systems running Windows 95.
<P>
To resolve the problems caused by installing an ADT application created
in Windows 95 on a computer running Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups
3.11, you can replace the affected system files on the client's computer
by decompressing the VER.DLL file from your Windows 3.1 or Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 installation disks and installing the Microsoft Access
version 2.0 Service Pack.
<P>
NOTE: You must rename the affected files before you install the Microsoft
Access 2.0 Service Pack.
<P>
<P><h3>Decompressing the VER.DLL File</h3>
 
<P>
To decompress the VER.DLL file, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the DECOMP.EXE file from Disk 1 of your Microsoft Access disks to
   your Windows directory.
<P>
   NOTE: DECOMP.EXE can also be found on Disk 1 of the Microsoft Access
   Developer's Toolkit and the Microsoft Office 4.3 disks.

<P><LI>Find the VER.DLL file on your Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups
   3.11 installation disks. It is usually located on Disk 2 or 3.

<P><LI>Insert the Windows disk (containing the VER.DLL file) in a floppy drive,
   type the following line, and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DECOMP &lt;drive&gt;:\VER.DL_ &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;directory&gt;\VER.DLL
</PRE><P>
   For example, to decompress the file from a disk in drive A to the
   Windows\System subdirectory on drive C, you would type the following
   line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DECOMP A:\VER.DL_ C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\VER.DLL
</PRE><P>
</OL>The size of the VER.DLL file when expanded should be 9,008, 9696, or
12,144.
<P>
NOTE: In some cases, you may receive the error "No header in file.
File may not be compressed" when using DECOMP.EXE. If this happens, try
using EXPAND.EXE."
<P>
<P><h3>Installing the Microsoft Access Service Pack</h3>

Service Pack and how to install it, please see the following articles in
