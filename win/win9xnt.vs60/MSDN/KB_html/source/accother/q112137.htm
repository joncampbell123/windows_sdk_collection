<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
The Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit (ADT) version 2.0 is the upgrade
to the Microsoft Access Distribution Kit (ADK) version 1.1, and complements
the retail version of Microsoft Access version 2.0. Developers can use the
ADT to assist them in developing advanced database applications, creating
client/server solutions, and developing wizards and other add-ins for
Microsoft Access.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The ADT provides a run-time version of Microsoft Access 2.0 and tools to
assist the developer with the creation and distribution of applications
developed using the retail version of Microsoft Access 2.0. The retail
version of Microsoft Access 2.0 is not included with the ADT, but can be
purchased separately.
<P>
The ADT includes a run-time version of Microsoft Graph for distributing
graphs and charts with applications, the Microsoft Windows Help compiler
for creating custom Help files, and a Setup Wizard for creating customized
Setup programs. Code samples for wizards, functions, and other utilities
are also included and can be copied and pasted directly into applications.
<P>
Detailed technical documentation and customization tools are provided,
including the Access Basic "Language Reference" manual, and the "Advanced
Topics" manual that addresses client/server development, connecting to
external data sources, and using data access objects (DAO). In addition,
there are sample OLE controls including Calendar, Scroll bar and Data
Outline controls.
