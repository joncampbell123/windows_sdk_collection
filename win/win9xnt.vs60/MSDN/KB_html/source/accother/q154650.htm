The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft dbWeb version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to start the dbWeb Service, you may receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not start dbWeb Service service on \\servername.
   Error 1067: The process terminated unexpectedly.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Upon startup, the dbWeb service attempts to establish a connection with the
dbWeb repository (a Microsoft Access database file called Dbweb.mdb located
in the \Dbweb\Admin) folder. If this attempt fails, the service quits with
an Error 1067. The failure may be related to a misconfiguration with the
ODBC system data source (System DSN) named "dbWebSchema." The service uses
this data source to communicate with the repository. Ensure that
"dbWebSchema" points to the proper file (Dbweb.mdb). The service will also
terminate if Dbweb.mdb is corrupted. Repair the database file using
Microsoft Access or the dbWeb Administrator (Utilities menu). Also, if the
repository (Dbweb.mdb) is exclusively opened by another process, the same
error message will occur.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The following steps list possible reasons why the dbWeb Service won't start
and the steps needed to correct the problem. The steps are divided into the
following sections:

<UL><LI>Misconfiguration of ODBC System Data Source
<P>
<P><PRE>    - No dbWebSchema Data Source
    - There is a dbWebSchema Data Source
</PRE>
<LI>Corrupted Dbweb.mdb
<LI>Dbweb.mdb Opened Exclusively
<P>
</UL>You should first follow the steps in the "Misconfiguration of ODBC System
Data Source" section, because it is the most common reason for the error.
This section is divided into two subsections: the "No dbWebSchema Data
Source" section, which details the steps of recreating the dbWebSchema data
source; and the "There is a dbWebSchema Data Source" section, which makes
sure the current dbWebSchema data source is set up properly. The "Corrupted
Dbweb.mdb" and the "Dbweb.mdb Opened Exclusively" sections are other
possible causes of the error. However, you should try these sections only
after you have follow the steps in the "Misconfiguration of ODBC System
Data Source" section.
<P>
<P><h3>Misconfiguration of ODBC System Data Source</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open Control Panel and double-click the 32-bit ODBC icon.

<P><LI>In the Data Sources dialog box, click the System DSN button.

<P><LI>In the System Data Sources dialog box, you should see a schema called
    "dbWebSchema" (not case sensitive).
<P>
    NO DBWEBSCHEMA DATA SOURCE

<P><LI>If you do see a dbWebSchema data source, then skip to the steps under
    the "There is a dbWebSchema Data Source" section. If you don't, then
    click the Add button.

<P><LI>In the Add Data Source dialog box, select the Microsoft Access Driver
    (*.mdb), and then click OK.

<P><LI>In the ODBC Microsoft Access Setup dialog box, type "dbWebSchema" in
    the line next to the Data Source Name.

<P><LI>Click the Select button under the Database section.

<P><LI>In the Select Database dialog box, select the Dbweb.mdb database. The
    default folder for the Dbweb.mdb is \dbWeb\Admin. Once you've chosen
    the Dbweb.mdb, click OK.

<P><LI>Once you're back in the ODBC Microsoft Access Setup dialog box, click
    OK.
<P>
    THERE IS A DBWEBSCHEMA DATA SOURCE

<P><LI>If the dbWebSchema data source is listed in the Data Sources dialog
    box, select the data source, and click the Setup button.

<P><LI>In the ODBC Microsoft Access Setup dialog box, verify that the path
    next to the "Database:" in the Database section points to the
    Dbweb.mdb. If it doesn't, then click the Select button. In the Select
    Database dialog box, select the Dbweb.mdb database. The default
    folder for the Dbweb.mdb is \dbWeb\Admin. Once you've chosen the
    Dbweb.mdb, click OK.

<P><LI>If it is pointing to the Dbweb.mdb, then delete the data source and
    recreate it. See the steps in the "No dbWebSchema Data Source" section
    for information about recreating the data source.
<P>
</OL><h3>Corrupted DBWEB.MDB</h3>
 
<P>
If the above steps don't solve the problem, the Dbweb.mdb may be corrupted.
To repair the Dbweb.mdb, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the dbWeb Administrator.

<P><LI>In the dbWeb Administrator, on the File menu, click Close.

<P><LI>On the Utilities menu, click Repair Database.

<P><LI>In the Select Database to Repair dialog box, select Dbweb.mdb. The
   default folder for the Dbweb.mdb is \dbWeb\Admin. Once you've chosen the
   Dbweb.mdb, click OK.
<P>
   In the status bar at the bottom of the dbWeb Administrator you should
   see "Repairing:," and then the path to the Dbweb.mdb. Then it will say
   "Ready" when it is finished.

<P><LI>If the database has unrecoverable errors that the Repair utility
   couldn't fix, then restore a copy of Dbweb.mdb from you backup copy.
<P>
</OL><h3>Dbweb.mdb Opened Exclusively</h3>
 
<P>
If the Dbweb.mdb is opened exclusively by another process (or user), the
dbWeb Service data source can't make the initial connection, and you will
receive an error message.
<P>
Make sure that no other user has Dbweb.mdb open exclusively. Also, check
for any other programs (such as Microsoft Access) that may have the
Dbweb.mdb open exclusively.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft dbWeb version
1.0. This problem no longer occurs in Microsoft dbWeb version 1.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open Control Panel and double-click the 32bit ODBC icon.

<P><LI>In the Data Sources dialog box, click the System DSN button.

<P><LI>In the System Data Sources dialog box, select the dbWebSchema data
   source, click the Delete button, and then click Close.

<P><LI>In the Data Sources dialog box, click the Close button.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the Services icon.

<P><LI>In the Service dialog box, select the dbWeb Service, and then click the
   Start button. Note that within a few seconds, you receive the error
   message mentioned in the "Symptoms" section.
