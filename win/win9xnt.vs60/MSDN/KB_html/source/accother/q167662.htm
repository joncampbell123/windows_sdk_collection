<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
You cannot remove a run-time application created with Microsoft Office 97
Developer Edition Tools if the Microsoft Access Run-Time Version was not
visible in the component list of your Setup program.
<P>
When you try to uninstall the application, you receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;Application Name&gt; Setup was not completed successfully.

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Verify that the "Display in Component List" check box is selected for the
Microsoft Access Run-Time Version when you create disk images with the
Setup Wizard. For example, follow the instructions in the "Steps to
Reproduce Behavior" section below, but omit step 7, which instructs you to
clear the "Display in Component List" check box.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Setup Wizard in Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools allows you
to customize your Setup program by selecting which components of your
application appear in the component list when a user selects the Custom
installation option.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
