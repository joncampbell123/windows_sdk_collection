<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
When you start Microsoft Replication Manager, you may receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Sharing Violation while attempting to open log file &lt;path to log file&gt;
   in Deny Write mode.

</PRE>This is followed by the following error, depending on which version you are
using.
<P>
<P><h3>In Microsoft Replication Manager 3.5</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Replication Manager can't start the Synchronizer. Without
   the Synchronizer running, no synchronization of data can occur.

   Do you want to work without the Synchronizer?

   Synchronizer could not be initialized.

</PRE><h3>In Microsoft Replication Manager 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Replication Manager can't start the Transporter. Without
   the Transporter running, no synchronization of data can occur.

   Do you want to work without the Transporter?

   Transport could not be initialized.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You are trying to run Transporter and Synchronizer at the same time,
and both are configured to use the same log file.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Reconfigure either Transporter or Synchronizer to use a different log file.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access
Developer's Toolkit 7.0 and Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When Synchronizer and Transporter start, they attempt to open their log
files for write access, and deny write access to other applications. If
Synchronizer and Transporter are configured to use the same log file, the
first application started can successfully access the log file for this
mode. However, this prevents the second application from accessing the file
in the same mode, and an error occurs during startup.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Replication Manager 3.0.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Configure Microsoft Replication Manager.

<P><LI>Add a managed folder if one is not in the list, and then click Next.
    The folder you select does not need to contain any replicas.

<P><LI>Select a shared network folder for indirect synchronizations, and then
    click Next.

<P><LI>In the "Path to Log File" box, type:
<P>
       C:\My Documents\Transporter.log
<P>
    Click Finish. Transporter will start on your computer.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Exit and Stop Transporter.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Replication Manager 3.5.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Configure Microsoft Replication Manager.

<P><LI>Click Next.

<P><LI>Click to select the Support Indirect Synchronization check box, and
    then click Next.

<P><LI>Click Next.

<P><LI>Select a shared Network folder for indirect synchronizations, and then
    click Next.

<P><LI>Click No to indicate that your computer is not an Internet server, and
    then click Next.

<P><LI>In the "Path to Log File" box, type:
<P>
       C:\My Documents\Transporter.log
<P>
    Note that this is the same path selected for the log file in step 5.
