<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
This article describes how to install and register an OLE control
(.OCX) using the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit version 2.0 (ADT)
Setup Wizard or a third-party installation program.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To use an OLE control in a Microsoft Access run-time application, you must
first install the OLE control and its support files; then, you must
register the control in the REG.DAT file in the \Windows\SYSTEM directory.
These two procedures are described in detail below.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing OLE Custom Controls</h3>
 
<P>
If you plan to use a third-party installation program to set up your run-
time application, make sure the OLE control and its support files are
installed in the following directories:
<P>
<PRE>   Directory         Filename        Description
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   \Windows\SYSTEM   OC1016.DLL      The OLE Control Support DLL shipped
                                     with the ADT.
   \Windows\SYSTEM   OC25.DLL        A support DLL required by controls
                                     created with the OLE Control
                                     Development Kit (CDK) for Microsoft
                                     Visual C\C++ version 2.0. If your
                                     control was not created with the CDK,
                                     this file is not needed.
   \&lt;application&gt;    MSAREG.EXE      The OLE Control registration tool.
   \&lt;application&gt;    &lt;control&gt;.OCX   The OLE Control file.
   \&lt;application&gt;    DAO2016.DLL     A DLL required for custom controls.

</PRE>If you plan to use the Microsoft ADT Setup Wizard to create your
distribution disks, follow these steps to ensure proper installation
of OLE controls:

<OL><P><LI>Open the Microsoft ADT Setup Wizard (SETUPWIZ.MDB) located in your
    \ACCESS\ADT directory.

<P><LI>In the "Pick the files to include with your application" box, click
    the Add File button.

<P><LI>In the Add File box, enter the full path to your database. Select the
    "Show in Program Manager Group" and "Run with MSARN200" options. In
    the INI File box, type the full path to your application's .INI file,
    and then click the OK button.

<P><LI>In the "Pick the files to include with your application" box, click
    the Add File button.

<P><LI>In the Add File box, type the full path to the OLE control (.OCX) file,
    and click OK.

<P><LI>If you are using a third-party OLE control, repeat steps 4 and 5 to add
    any support DLLs for the OLE control.
<P>
    If you are using an OLE control included with the Microsoft ADT (the
    MSACAL20.OCX, MSASB20.OCX, or OUTL1016.DLL files), the Setup Wizard
    prompts you with the message "The file you've selected depends on 1
    file(s). Do you want to see a list?" Click the No button. In the Add
    File box, click OK. The Setup Wizard adds the OLE support file,
    OC1016.DLL.

<P><LI>After you add the OLE control (and its supporting DLLs), click the Next
    button in the "Pick the files to include with your application" box.

<P><LI>In the "What optional features does your application support?"
    box, make sure the OLE 2.01 option (or OLE 2.02, if you installed the
    Microsoft Access 2.0 Service Pack) is selected.

<P><LI>In the "What is the name of your application" box, type a name
    for your application. Also, type a name for the directory that your
    custom setup program suggests as a default directory, and then
    click Next.

<P><LI>In the "Do you want to run another application after Setup is
    finished?" box, click Next.

<P><LI>In the "Where do you want to create the disk images" box, type a
    path for your application's SETUP directory, select a type of disk
    setup, and then click Finish.
<P>
    At this point, you can use your distribution disks to set up you run-
    time application and register any OLE control.
<P>
</OL><h3>Registering OLE Controls</h3>
 
<P>
If you use the Microsoft ADT Setup Wizard to create your distribution
disks, your OLE controls are registered automatically when you set up your
run-time application. The Microsoft Access Setup program installs and runs
the file MSAREG.EXE that registers any .OCX files you picked in the ADT
Setup Wizard.
<P>
If you plan to use a third-party installation program, make sure all OLE
controls are registered properly in the REG.DAT file of the \Windows\SYSTEM
directory. To register an OLE control, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Windows 3.x, in Program Manager or File Manager, click Run on the
   File menu. In Windows 95, click the Start Button, and then click Run.

<P><LI>In the Command box (or Open box in Windows 95), type a command similar
   to the following line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      MSAREG.EXE C:\&lt;application&gt;\&lt;control&gt;.OCX
</PRE><P>
   For example, to register the Calendar control type the following line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      MSAREG.EXE C:\ACCESS\ADT\MSACAL20.OCX
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click OK to run the MSAREG.EXE file and to register the OLE control.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: OLE controls created with the OLE Control Development Kit (CDK) for
Microsoft Visual C\C++ version 2.0 require users to install OLE version
2.02. For more information about OLE 2.02, please see the following
