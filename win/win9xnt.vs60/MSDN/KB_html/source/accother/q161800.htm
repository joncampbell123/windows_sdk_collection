The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
When you try to install a custom application using Setup disks created with
the Setup Wizard in the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit (ADT) for
Windows 95, you may receive the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup was not completed successfully

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error has different causes, depending on what options you selected in
the ADT Setup Wizard at the time that you created the Setup disks:
<P>
- In the Setup Wizard, you added the name of an executable file that will
<PRE>  run after the Setup program is completed and used the default setting on
  the command line for the executable file. For example, if you add the
  file README.TXT, in the "Run the following file after the custom Setup
  program is completed" box, then the default command line is as follows:

     "$(FilePath)\README.TXT"

</PRE>- In the Setup Wizard, you added the Replication functionality and
<PRE>  specified a server name in the "Path to Shared Network Folder" box
  that does not exist or contains a space. For example, you entered a
  \\server\share path as follows:

     \\My App\Share

</PRE>- In the Setup Wizard, you added the Replication functionality and
<PRE>  specified a particular network server in the "Path to Shared Network
  Folder" box. However, when you tried to install the custom application,
  the computer did not have a connection to the particular network
  server.

</PRE>- In the Setup Wizard, you added the Replication functionality and
<PRE>  specified a particular network server in the "Path to Shared Network
  Folder" box. However, adequate permissions have not been set for the
  individual running the custom setup program.

</PRE>- In the Setup Wizard, on the screen marked "Add the files that you want
<PRE>  your custom Setup program to copy and then set properties for each
  file:", the "Set as Workgroup file" check box has been selected for your
  main application file (.mdb).

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are five possible workarounds to this error:

<UL><LI>If the cause is that you included an executable file to run after setup
   finishes, then run the Setup Wizard again and specify a complete
   command line for the file. Enclose any files, paths, or strings that
   might contain spaces in quotation marks, for example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      "$(WinPath)\NOTEPAD.EXE" "$(AppPath)\README.TXT"
</PRE>
<LI>If the cause is an error in the "Path to Shared Network Folder" setting
   for the Replication feature, then run the Setup Wizard again and enter a
   correct server name without spaces, for example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \\MyApp\Share
</PRE>
<LI>If the cause is the lack of a connection to a network share for the
   Replication feature, then establish a connection and rerun the Setup
   program for the custom application.

<LI>If the cause is that inadequate permissions have been set for the
   individual running the custom setup program, then have share level
   permissions of read/write/create assigned to this individual before
   running the custom setup program.

<LI>If the cause is that you specified your main application file as your
   workgroup file, then rerun the Setup Wizard and specify a valid
   workgroup file (.mdw). The selected file should store option and
   security settings for your application.
<P>
   NOTE: If you do not specify a workgroup information file for your
   application and your application requires one, the Setup Wizard
   will create this file for you.
