The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools
<LI>Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
When you use the Setup Wizard that ships with the Microsoft Office 97
Developer Edition Tools (ODE) or the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit
(ADT), and you specify an icon in the Icon File box of the "Add the
shortcuts screen," that icon does not appear in the title bar or the
taskbar of your application after you have installed it on the target
computer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Icon File box specifies the icon that you want Windows to display for
the shortcut, but it does not specify the icon that appears in the
application's title bar or the taskbar.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Set the Application Icon for the main application database, and then add
the icon in the list of files that you want the Setup Wizard to include in
the installation.
<P>
Note: The following steps assume that the application's icon file is
located in the Windows System folder (directory). If you want to place the
icon file within the same folder as the custom application, you must create
a custom profile for your application, which includes a Run-Time options
registry entry.
<P>
For more information about creating custom profiles, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../accother/q165631.htm">Q165631</A></B>
   TITLE     : ODE97: Creating Profiles for Custom Application in Setup
               Wizard

</PRE><h3>Setting the Application Icon</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open your database file in Microsoft Access.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Startup.

<P><LI>In the Startup dialog box, type the name of your icon file in the
   Application Icon box. You may also click the Build button and select
   your icon file in the Icon Browser dialog box.

<P><LI>After you have selected the icon file, edit the Application Icon box so
   that the icon file does not have a path associated with it. For example,
   if you select the icon file in the Icon Browser dialog box, there may be
   a path to the file as follows: C:\MyIcons\MyIcon.ico. For the icon to be
   displayed in the ADT/ODE application, modify the Application Icon so
   that it reads as follows: MyIcon.ico.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Close the database.
<P>
</OL><h3>Building the Disk Images to Use the Application Icon</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the ADT or ODE Setup Wizard.

<P><LI>On the Add Files screen of the Setup wizard, add your database file
   to the List Of Files box and select the "Set as Application's Main File"
   check box.

<P><LI>Add the icon file that you set as the Application Icon for your
   database.

<P><LI>Change the Destination Folder box for the icon file to $(WinSysPath).

<P><LI>Add any additional files that you may need for your application.

<P><LI>Complete the Setup Wizard as you would normally for your application.
<P>
</OL>When you install your application to the target computer, your icon appears
in both the title bar and the taskbar.
<P>
NOTE: If you select your icon as the Icon File for your shortcut, the icon
also appears on the Start menu for your application.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps To Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: By default, the sample database Northwind.mdb does not have an
Application Icon set. If you have changed this property in the Northwind
database, this example will not work.

<OL><P><LI>Run the ADT or ODE Setup wizard.

<P><LI>On the Add Files screen of the Setup wizard, add the Northwind.mdb
   file and select the "Set as Application's Main File" check box.

<P><LI>Add an icon file to the List Of Files box.

<P><LI>Click Next.

<P><LI>On the "Add the shortcuts" screen of the Setup wizard, create a
   shortcut to start the database and select the Run-Time check box.
   Select the icon file from the Icon File box.
<P>
   NOTE: In the ADT 7.0, the Run-Time check box is listed under the
   Database Command-Line Options. In the ODE 97, these options are listed
   on the Database Shortcut Properties tab.

<P><LI>Complete the Setup wizard by clicking Finish.

<P><LI>Install the application on a target computer.
<P>
</OL>Note that the shortcut created by the Setup program displays your icon, but
when you run the application, only the default Windows icon appears in the
title bar and the taskbar.
