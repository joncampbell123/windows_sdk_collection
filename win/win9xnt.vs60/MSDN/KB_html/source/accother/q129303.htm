The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit version 2.0, 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
When you insert an ActiveX control in an application in the retail version
of Microsoft Access, the control may appear blank when you run the
application as a run-time application. You may also receive the error
message "There is no object in this control."
<P>
NOTE: This behavior will also occur if you make a copy of an ActiveX
control
that already exists on a form.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The ActiveX control may be blank or you may receive the error message if
you do not specify the ActiveX control (*.OCX) file in the Setup Wizard
on the screen marked "Add the files that you want your custom Setup program
to copy and then set properties for each file." (Or in the Files To Include
dialog box in Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit 2.0 and 7.0)
<P>
The Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit (ADT) documentation does not
clearly state that you must specify the .OCX file when you use the Setup
Wizard.
<P>
NOTE: The Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools Help topic, "Adding
ActiveX Controls to Your Custom Setup Program," explains the relationship
between the ActiveX control and its associated .OCX file.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>In the ODE Setup Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
When you add an ActiveX control on the Add Files page, the Setup Wizard
searches for the .dep file for this control. If it finds the .dep file, the
Setup Wizard automatically adds the supporting files specified in the .dep
file to the list of files on the Add Files page. If the Setup Wizard can't
find a .dep file for the control, or if it can't find one of the supporting
files specified in the .dep file, an error message is displayed. If the
ActiveX control doesn't have a .dep file, and you know what files are
required to use the control, you have to add the .OCX file and the
supporting files directly on the Add files page of the Setup wizard.
<P>
<P><h3>In the ADT Setup Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
When you specify the control's .OCX file, the Setup Wizard specifies which
dependent dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) to include. Once you include them,
these two files properly register the OLE control in all run-time
applications.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Some run-time applications may properly display the OLE control on
computers that already have the ODE or ADT installed. This depends on
whether that control has previously been registered correctly on that
computer. Registration can occur manually or through the installation of
programs such as the ODE or ADT. These configuration variables can account
for the intermittent nature of this behavior.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open an existing Microsoft Access database, and then create a new
   blank form.

<P><LI>In Microsoft Access 97:
<P>
   a. On the Insert menu, click ActiveX control.
   b. In the Insert ActiveX Control box, click Calendar Control 8.0.
<P>
   In Microsoft Access 7.0:
<P>
   a. On the Insert menu, click Custom Control.
   b. In the "Insert OLE Custom Control" dialog box, in the "Select a
<P><PRE>      Custom Control" list, click Calendar Control.
</PRE><P>
   In Microsoft Access 2.0
<P>
   a. On the Edit menu, click Custom Control.
   b. In the Control Type box, select Calendar Control, and then click
<P><PRE>      OK.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save and close the form.

<P><LI>Create and save an AutoExec macro to open the form.

<P><LI>Close the database.

<P><LI>To produce a run-time version of the application, run the ODE or ADT
   Setup Wizard and include the database, but do not include the .OCX file
   when you are prompted for the files to include.

<P><LI>When the Setup Wizard finishes, install the new run-time application on
   a computer which does not already have Microsoft Access installed.

<P><LI>Open the new run-time application.
<P>
</OL>If the control is displayed correctly, an application, such as the ODE or
ADT, has previously registered the control on the computer.
