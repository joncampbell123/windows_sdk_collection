The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft dbWeb versions 1.0, 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft DbWeb can insert, update, or delete records from various back-end
databases. Typically, you want to supply the user with some information
about whether their insert, update, or delete was successful. DbWeb
supplies a default insert, update, and delete success/failure message.
This is generally enough information; however, you may want to customize
this message.
<P>
Your custom insert, update, and delete message can be an entire HTML
document that can take on the look and feel of the rest of your HTML
documents. You can customize these messages in two ways.
<P>
First, you can type the HTML directly in the property sheet of the "Insert
success msg," "Insert fail msg," "Update success msg," "Update fail msg,"
"Delete success msg," and "Delete fail msg."
<P>
Second, you can supply a URL to an HTML document; however, you must use the
&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="REFRESH" CONTENT="0; URL=/dbWeb/MyHTML.htm"&gt; HTML tag.
However, this HTML tag is not supported by all browsers. Some browsers that
do support it are Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 3.0 and 2.0, and
Netscape versions 3.0 and 2.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following steps detail the two methods described above.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1 - Typing HTML Tags into Property Sheet</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start dbWeb Administrator.

<P><LI>Select and open the Customers sample schema.

<P><LI>In the Schema tab, click to select the Insert check box.

<P><LI>Click the Ins/Upd/Del tab.

<P><LI>Under "Data columns in selected table," expand the Customers table by
    double-clicking it.

<P><LI>Click the Add-All button.

<P><LI>Under "Insert data columns," select "Customers.Customer ID."

<P><LI>Click the Properties button.

<P><LI>On the properties sheet, make sure that you are looking at the
    Insert/Update Form properties. To do this, just below the titlebar of
    the properties sheet, there is a drop-down list. Click the arrow to
    view your three selections, and choose the Insert/Update Form
    Properties.

<P><LI>Type the following in the "Insert success msg" property:
<P>
       &lt;HTML&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Insert Success&lt;/TITLE&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;Your insert was
       successful&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;

<P><LI>Type the following into the "Insert fail msg" property:
<P>
      &lt;HTML&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Insert Failed&lt;/TITLE&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;Your insert
      failed&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;
<P>
    NOTE: The "Insert success msg," "Insert fail msg," "Update success
    msg," "Update fail msg," "Delete success msg," and "Delete fail msg"
    properties are limited to 2047 characters. Also, you can use plain text
    without the HTML tags. The HTML tags will allow you to customize the
    look in your Internet browser.

<P><LI>Close the properties sheet.

<P><LI>Click the Apply button.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2 - Using a URL to Reference a Custom HTML Document</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: The following example references two HTML documents called
MySuccess.htm (insert success message) and MyFail.htm (insert failure
message). Just substitute your own custom HTML document names for
MySuccess.htm and MyFail.htm.

<OL><P><LI>Start dbWeb Administrator.

<P><LI>Select and open the Customers sample schema.

<P><LI>On the Schema tab, click to select the Insert check box.

<P><LI>Click the Ins/Upd/Del tab.

<P><LI>Under "Data columns in selected table," expand the Customers table by
   double-clicking it.

<P><LI>Click the Add-All button.

<P><LI>Under "Insert data columns," select "Customers.Customer ID."

<P><LI>Click the Properties button.

<P><LI>On the properties sheet make sure that you a looking at the
    Insert/Update Form Properties. To do this, just below the titlebar of
    the properties sheet, there is a drop-down list. Click the arrow to
    view your three selections, and choose the Insert/Update Form
    Properties.

<P><LI>Type the following into the "Insert success msg" property:
<P>
      &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="REFRESH" CONTENT="0; URL=/dbWeb/MySuccess.htm"&gt;

<P><LI>Type the following into the "Insert fail msg" property:
<P>
      &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="REFRESH" CONTENT="0; URL=/dbWeb/MyFail.htm"&gt;
<P>
    NOTE: The above "URL=/dbWeb/MySuccess.htm" assumes that your relative
    path to the dbWeb documents folder is "/dbweb/" and your HTML document
    is located in that folder.

<P><LI>Close the Properties sheet.

<P><LI>Click the Apply button.
<P>
</OL>To test these two methods, open your favorite browser and use the "getqbe"
method to open the Customers sample schema. Click the Submit Query button.
On the next page, click the Submit button. Type a new CompanyID and Company
Name, and then click Submit Insert. You should see your custom success
message. To see your custom failure message follow the same steps, except
do not type any information on the submit customer page, and then click
Submit Insert. You should now see your custom failure message.
