The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools
<LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0 for Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup Wizard for your custom application on a Windows 95
computer that is running Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0, and then
you install your application on a computer that does not have Microsoft
Internet Explorer version 4.0 installed, you may receive the following
error message
<P>
<PRE>   Comcat.dll was unable to register itself in the system registry

</PRE>and setup is not completed successfully.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup Wizard for Office 97 Developer Edition Tools on a
computer that has Internet Explorer version 4.0 installed, a newer version
of the Comcat.dll file is added to the disk images.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, create your Office 97 Developer Edition Tools
distribution disks on a computer that does not have the newer version of
the Comcat.dll file installed (the one that is distributed with Microsoft
Internet Explorer version 4.0).
<P>
-or-
<P>
Ensure that all of the workstations that you are distributing your
application to have Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0 installed.
<P>
To accomplish this, do any one the following:

<UL><LI>Create the Office 97 Developer Edition Tools distribution disks on a
   workstation that does not have Internet explorer version 4.0 installed.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Create the Office 97 Developer Edition Tools distribution disks on a
   Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 workstation or server.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>Change the version of Comcat.dll that you are distributing with your
   custom application to a version that is compatible to all workstations.
<P>
</UL>Each of these solutions is explained in more detail in the "More
Information" section.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: After recreating disk images using solutions 2 or 3, you must rename
or delete the newer version of Comcat.dll on any computers that you
attempted to install your original run-time application to before you
reinstall your application.
<P>
<P><h3>Solution 1</h3>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
You can successfully distribute your application to all workstations that
have Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0 already installed on their
workstations.
<P>
<P><h3>Solution 2</h3>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
Run the Setup wizard and build your disk images on a computer that does not
have Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 installed or on a Microsoft Windows NT
version 4.0 workstation or server. Disk images that you build on a computer
that does not have Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0 installed or on
Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 platforms will install properly on a
target computer, regardless of the version of Microsoft Internet Explorer
that is installed because the version of Comcat.dll on either platform will
be compatible with Windows 95.
<P>
If you distribute an application using the Microsoft Office 97 Developer
Edition and Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0 from Microsoft Windows
NT version 4.0, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

   TITLE     : ODE: Run-Time Application Built on IE 4.0 Computer Breaks
               IE 3.x

</PRE><h3>Solution 3</h3>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
NOTE: A file is available for download from the Microsoft Software Library
(Mdtupdtr.exe) that automatically carries out the manual steps listed below
for Solution 3. For more information, please see the following article in

    TITLE     : SetupWizard Template Files Updater Available on MSL

</PRE>It is possible to change the version of Comcat.dll that is included in your
disk images by changing an entry in two of the Setup Wizard's tables.
<P>
WARNING: Because the following solution will modify the Setup Wizard's
default tables, you should back up the following two tables for reference.
If you completed a default installation of the Microsoft Office 97
Developer Edition, move to the following folder:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\ODETools\Setup Wizard\Msaccomp

</PRE>and copy these files into a different folder:
<P>
<PRE>   01Microsoft Access Run-Time Version.MDT
   07Microsoft Graph 97 Run-Time Version.MDT

</PRE>After you have made backups of these two tables, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Copy a version of Comcat.dll that will register correctly into
   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\ODE Tools\Setup Wizard\Redist
   folder on your development computer.
<P>
   NOTE: Version 4.71, which is on both the Office 97 Professional
   CD-ROM and the Microsoft Access 97 CD-ROM, will work.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Access.

<P><LI>In the Microsoft Access dialog box, select Open An Existing Database,
   and then select More Files in the list box. Click OK.

<P><LI>In the Open dialog box, select All Files (*.*) in the Files Of Type box,
   and move to the following directory:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\ODETools\Setup Wizard\Msaccomp
</PRE>
<P><LI>Select and open the file 01Microsoft Access Run-time Version.MDT.

<P><LI>Open the SHAREDMSO table and find the line with the following values:
<P>
<P><PRE>      LineID: add Comcat_dll
      Param2: $(WinSysPath)
      Param3: C:\Windows\System\COMCAT.DLL
</PRE><P>
   Change these values so that they read as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      LineID: add Comcat_dll
      Param2: $(SwizSetupFilesPath)
      Param3: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\ODE Tools\Setup Wizard\
<PRE></PRE>              Redist\COMCAT.DLL

</PRE><P><LI>Close the database.

<P><LI>Select and Open the file 07Microsoft Graph 97 Run-Time Version.MDT and
   repeat steps 6 and 7.
