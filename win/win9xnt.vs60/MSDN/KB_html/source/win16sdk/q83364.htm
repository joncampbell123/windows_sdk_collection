<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If an application window or dialog box has a number of edit controls, the
user can lose track of the control that has the input focus. FLSHEDIT is a
file in the Microsoft Software Library that demonstrates how to make an
edit control flash to indicate that the control has the input focus. The
technique used by FLSHEDIT is similar to calling the FlashWindow function.
FlashWindow flashes the caption bar on a window to gain the user's
attention.
<P>
Download FLSHEDIT.EXE, a self-extracting file, from the Microsoft Software
Library (MSL) on the following services:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Download Service (MSDL)
<P><PRE>      Dial (206) 936-6735 to connect to MSDL
      Download <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/flshedit.exe">FLSHEDIT.EXE</A> <I>(size: 30447 bytes)</I> 
</PRE>
<LI>Internet (anonymous FTP)
<P><PRE>      ftp ftp.microsoft.com
      Change to the \SOFTLIB\MSLFILES directory
      Get <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/flshedit.exe">FLSHEDIT.EXE</A> <I>(size: 30447 bytes)</I>

</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The FLSHEDIT sample contains a dialog box with four edit controls. The
application uses one timer, which is used to flash whichever edit control
has the focus. The application sets the timer each time an edit control
receives the input focus (an EN_SETFOCUS message). The timer is destroyed
when an edit control loses the input focus (an EN_KILLFOCUS message) or
when the context of the edit control changes (an EN_CHANGE message).
<P>
When the specified time elapses and the application receives a WM_TIMER
message, the application invalidates the contents of the edit control and
specifies the new text and background colors. Then Windows redraws the
control using the new colors.
<P>
Therefore, a control stops flashing when either of the following events
take place:

<UL><LI>The user takes the input focus away from the control.
<LI>The user changes the text contents of the control.
<P>
</UL>The FLSHEDIT application provides an option to stop the flashing and to
change the color of the flashing.
<P>
In addition to flashing, the FLSHEDIT sample changes the text in an edit
control to indicate that the control has the input focus. However, if the
user changes the contents of an edit control, the changed text remains even
after the user moves the input focus to another control. If the user
changes the text to an empty string, the edit control regains its default
contents.
<P>
Windows 3.0 does not properly change the background color of a single-line
edit control.
<P>
FLSHEDIT incorporates the first method provided by this Knowledge Base
article.
