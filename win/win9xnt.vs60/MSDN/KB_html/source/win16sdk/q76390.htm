<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In 386 enhanced mode, Windows system timer (WM_TIMER) messages are
generated less often when an MS-DOS-based application runs full-screen with
its PIF file specifying background execution than when the same
MS-DOS-based application runs in a window.
<P>
When a full-screen MS-DOS-based application is running, Windows does not
need to track the mouse and update the screen. Therefore, Windows runs with
a low priority in the background. Windows-based applications receive fewer
WM_TIMER messages because the number of timer ticks that Windows
receives decreases from 18.2 per second to 2 per second or even fewer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows's 386 enhanced mode architecture and display mechanism account
for the way that WM_TIMER messages behave when MS-DOS-based applications
are running.
<P>
First of all, WM_TIMER messages are not guaranteed to be sent exactly
at a specified time; they may be sent any time after the specified
time has elapsed. For example, a WM_TIMER message set for 60
milliseconds may be sent at exactly 60 milliseconds, or it may be sent
more than two minutes later. WM_TIMER messages behave this way because
they have the lowest priority of any Windows message. Applications
receive WM_TIMER messages only after all other messages in the system
have been processed (that is, when all message queues are empty).
<P>
In 386 enhanced mode, Windows uses a virtual machine architecture that
sets up a virtual machine (VM) for each MS-DOS-based application. Windows
is essentially an MS-DOS-based application and creates a VM for itself
called the System VM. The System VM runs Windows and all Windows-based
applications; each MS-DOS-based application receives a separate VM.
<P>
Virtual machines behave like 8086 processors with additional privileged
instructions provided by the 80386 processor's virtual-8086 mode. Virtual-
8086 mode differs from real mode in that it has memory protection, virtual
memory, and privilege-checking mechanisms. Each virtual machine also has an
optional protected-mode portion. The System VM uses its protected mode
portion to run Windows-based applications.
<P>
The Windows Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) controls the multitasking of
the virtual machines; it manages memory, CPU execution time, and
device coordination. The VMM runs in the 80386 processor's 32-bit flat
memory model along with Windows virtual devices (VxDs), and
preemptively schedules the virtual machines.
<P>
Foreground virtual machines running MS-DOS-based applications always
receive 18.2 timer ticks each second so that the VM looks exactly like a
stand-alone 8086 machine. When the System VM is in the foreground, it
(and Windows) receives 18.2 timer ticks per second as well.
<P>
Background virtual machines do not receive 18.2 timer ticks per
second; they receive 2 or fewer ticks per second because the VMM
reduces their relative priorities. As a result, the foreground VM can
run faster.
<P>
When the System VM is in the background and a full-screen MS-DOS-based
application is in the foreground, Windows receives fewer timer ticks,
and therefore runs slower than normal. Windows-based applications process
their messages slower, causing WM_TIMER messages to be delayed.
<P>
Windowed MS-DOS-based applications behave differently from full-screen
MS-DOS-based applications. Windows creates a special agent application,
WINOLDAP, to run windowed MS-DOS-based applications. WINOLDAP's job is to
place all output from an MS-DOS-based application into the client area of a
window. Windows controls all parts of the display, including the area of
the windowed MS-DOS-based application, and tracks the mouse pointer.
<P>
Under such circumstances, Windows is running in the background with a
high priority. The windowed MS-DOS-based application is running in the
foreground in a VM. The VMM preemptively multitasks the VMs so that
the MS-DOS-based application can run and Windows can manage the screen.
Because the System VM has a high priority, it receives more timer ticks per
second than other background VMs. Windows and Windows-based applications,
therefore, process more messages, which allows WM_TIMER messages to be
sent more often.
<P>
Even though background VMs receive fewer timer ticks per second, they
still receive time slices according to their relative priorities.
<P>
NOTE: This article applies to MS-DOS-based applications that have a PIF
file set for background execution. If the MS-DOS-based application is
running full-screen in the foreground with its PIF file set to exclusive
processing, all other applications, including Windows, will be
suspended, just as if the MS-DOS-based application were run under Windows
in standard mode. If the MS-DOS-based application runs in a window with
exclusive processing set, then Windows does not get suspended because it
must manage the screen output for the MS-DOS-based application.
