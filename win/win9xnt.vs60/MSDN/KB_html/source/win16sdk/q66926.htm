The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.0 and 3.1

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Text strings in a dialog box resource cannot start with the character
represented by the value 255 (0xFF). In the ANSI character set, this
character is the letter "y" with a diaeresis mark, which is used primarily
in Nordic languages. If Windows encounters this situation, a call to
DialogBox() or CreateDialog() will fail.
<P>
The following are two possible solutions:

<UL><LI>Create the control with some "dummy" text. Then, use the
   SetDlgItemText() function during the processing of the WM_INITDIALOG
   message to manually set the text of the control to its proper value.
   This is the preferred method.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Instead of starting the text with the 255 character, use a space,
   followed by a backspace character and the 255 character. For example,
   the text in the dialog box script can be " \0008x", where "x" is the
   255 character. The embedded backspace erases the space, leaving only
   the 255 character.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows uses the number 255 to indicate that a resource is represented by
ordinal value instead of by a string name. For example, when a dialog box
is declared as follows
<P>
<PRE>   AboutBox    DIALOG  ...

</PRE>the text "AboutBox" appears in the .RES file. However, using the following
<P>
<PRE>   1           DIALOG  ...

</PRE>places the bytes 0xFF 0x01 0x00 into the .RES file. The 0xFF is used to
indicate that the next two bytes are the ordinal value for this resource.
<P>
When creating a dialog box, the Windows Dialog Manager scans through each
string in the dialog box template to find the null terminator. However,
when a string that starts with 255 is encountered, it is interpreted as an
ordinal value. In this situation, Windows incorrectly skips the next 2
bytes and treats the new position as the next piece of data in the dialog
box template.
<P>
Whenever this occurs, the remainder of the dialog box template is
interpreted incorrectly, and Windows tries to create controls of unknown
classes, with unknown styles, in unknown locations. This causes the dialog
box creation to fail.
<P>
For additional information about dialog box creation failure reasons, query
