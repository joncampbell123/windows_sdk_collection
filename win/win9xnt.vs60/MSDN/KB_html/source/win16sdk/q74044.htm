   versions 3.0 and 3.1

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows is designed to use a logical coordinate system when doing many of
its graphics operations. Many of the Windows functions take logical units
as parameters. Windows translates these units to physical device units
based on the mapping mode of the device, window origin, window extents,
viewport origin, and viewport extents.
<P>
This article discusses the relationship between logical and physical
coordinates.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The default mapping mode for a device context (DC) is the MM_TEXT mode. The
point (0,0) is the origin of the logical and physical coordinate systems in
this mode. It also has a 1 to 1 mapping ratio of logical to physical device
units.
<P>
The programmer can change the mapping mode of a DC by using the
SetMapMode() function.
<P>
The following six mapping modes have predefined logical to physical mapping
ratios:

<UL><LI>MM_TEXT
<LI>MM_LOENGLISH
<LI>MM_HIENGLISH
<LI>MM_LOMETRIC
<LI>MM_HIMETRIC
<LI>MM_TWIPS
<P>
</UL>The following two mapping modes can be set to have user defined ratios
of logical to physical units:

<UL><LI>MM_ANISOTROPIC
<LI>MM_ISOTROPIC
<P>
</UL>In the last two modes, coordinates are transformed from logical to physical
and vice versa based on the current window and viewport extents in the DC.
The functions SetWindowExt() and SetViewportExt() allow an application to
set the window and viewport extents. These functions should only be used in
the MM_ANISOTROPIC and MM_ISOTROPIC mapping modes because they are the only
ones in which the application can define the mapping ratio.
<P>
The formulae used to convert to and from the different coordinate systems
are documented in section 2.5.3, page 2-18, in the "Microsoft Windows
Software Development Kit Reference Volume 1" for version 3.0.
