<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article is a brief overview of the Sound Blaster card hardware
and how it works with the Multimedia Extensions to Microsoft Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following is a list of features that the Sound Blaster card
offers. Differences between the version 1.0 and version 1.5 boards are
noted where appropriate. Differences between the versions 1.x and
version 2.0 digital signal processors (DSPs) are also noted.

<OL><P><LI>12-Voice Stereo C/MS Music
<P>
   C/MS stands for creative music synthesizer. C/MS is a low-end
   synthesizer that is compatible with the Game Blaster. As the name
   implies, it synthesizes music by taking a basic waveform and
   manipulating it (note that this is a generalization).
<P>
   This particular synthesizer uses a technique called square wave
   synthesis. It is similar to a synthesizer found in an inexpensive
   toy; but the Sound Blaster does not have a keyboard attached.
   Instead using of keys, notes are turned on and off by writing
   commands to hardware registers on the Sound Blaster board.
<P>
   When C/MS is marketed as having 12 voices, reference is being made
   to the number of different sounds the C/MS synthesizer can play at
   the same time (commonly referred to as "polyphony").
<P>
   The Sound Blaster uses two C/MS chips, each with six voices. In
   this way, the first chip can be assigned to the left channel and
   the second chip can be assigned to the right channel. Thus, the
   Sound Blaster can produce stereo sound.
<P>
   The version 1.0 Sound Blaster board was shipped with the C/MS chip
   set installed. However, Creative Labs removed the chips from the
   version 1.5 board and sells the C/MS chips separately. The version
   1.0 box sells the Sound Blaster as the "24-Voice All-in-One Sound
   Card." The version 1.5 box shortened this to "The All-in-One Sound
   Card" because they removed 12 of the "voices."
<P>
   To determine if the C/MS chips are in place, run TEST-SBC.EXE. If
   the chips are present, the features list will list them. The
   Multimedia Extensions to Windows currently does not use the C/MS
   feature.

<P><LI>11-Voice FM Music (AdLib Compatible)
<P>
   FM stands for frequency modulation, which is how the sound is
   produced. The Sound Blaster has 11 FM-voices (11 notes polyphony),
   and unlike FM-stereo radio, the sound is mono only. FM-synthesis
   produces slightly better sounds than square wave synthesis, which
   is what the C/MS chip set does.
<P>
   The Sound Blaster's FM synthesizer is "AdLib" compatible. AdLib is
   the brand name of an FM synthesizer chip set; many different
   companies (including Creative Labs) clone these chips. The AdLib
   driver in Multimedia Windows will work with any AdLib-compatible
   synthesizer, which, of course, includes the Sound Blaster.

<P><LI>1 Digitized Voice Channel
<P>
   This can be called many things: sampled sound, digitized sound, and
   so forth. The Sound Blaster refers to it as a digitized voice,
   which is not the same as the voices mentioned above. The Multimedia
   Extensions to Windows calls this digitized sound output "waveform
   output," which is confusing because all sound is comprised of
   waves! Digital enthusiasts call this pulse code modulation (PCM),
   which is actually a more accurate title.
<P>
   Digitized sound is real sound (human voice, music, effects, and so
   forth) that is sampled and digitized with a digital-to-analog
   converter (DAC). This is the same type of data stored on audio
   compact discs (CDs); however, CDs have a much greater resolution
   both in sample rate (44.1 KHz) and sample word size (12 to 16
   bits).
<P>
   PCM is a simple technique of encoding analog audio in a digital
   format, where the waveform amplitude is sampled periodically (at
   the sampling frequency) and stored as a number. The term "8 bit"
   means that the stored number can have one of 256 discrete values;
   12 bit has 4096 discrete values; and 16 bit has 65535.
<P>
   The Sound Blaster has one mono 8-bit DAC that can be set to a
   sample rate between ~4 KHz and ~23 KHz. This does not produce very
   high quality but it can be fun none the less. Incidentally, this is
   where that 24th voice of the version 1.0 card came from: 12 C/MS +
   11 FM + 1 DAC = 24.
<P>
   The Multimedia Extensions require a minimum of 11 KHz and 22 KHz
   8-bit wave output, which the Sound Blaster can do.
<P>
   Another interesting thing about the Sound Blaster is that it
   supports three different adaptive differential pulse code
   modulation (ADPCM) decompression ratios (as well as no compression)
   in hardware. Below is a list of these ratios:
<P>
<P><PRE>      - 2 to 1 data compression:  4 bit ADPCM
      - 3 to 1 data compression:  2.6 bit ADPCM
      - 4 to 1 data compression:  2 bit ADPCM
</PRE><P>
   This may be the only justification for Creative Labs's use of the
   term digital signal processor (DSP) for its programmable logic
   array (PLA). Keep in mind that the greater the ratio, the greater
   the degradation in sample quality.
<P>
   The Multimedia Extensions to Windows does not make use of ADPCM at
   this time. Also note that Multimedia Windows uses the direct memory
   access (DMA) mode of the Sound Blaster for recording and playing
   digitized sound.
<P>
   If a board with the versions 1.x DSP is installed and Multimedia
   Windows is running in enhanced mode, a periodic click is audible
   when playing a wave file. This is caused by interrupt latency,
   meaning that interrupts are not serviced immediately. This causes
   the Sound Blaster to click because the versions 1.x DSP produce an
   interrupt when the current DMA buffer is exhausted. The click is
   the time it takes for the interrupt to be serviced by the Sound
   Blaster driver (which is delayed by the 386 enhanced mode of
   Windows).
<P>
   The click is still present in standard mode, although it is much
   less pronounced because the interrupt latency is less. The click is
   more pronounced for pure tones.
<P>
   The version 2.0 DSP solves this problem by using the auto-
   initialize mode of the DMA controller (the 8237). In this mode, the
   DMA controller automatically reloads the start address and count
   registers with the original values. In this way, the Sound Blaster
   driver can allocate a 4K DMA buffer; using the lower 2K as the
   "ping" buffer and the upper 2K as the "pong" buffer.
<P>
   While the DMA controller is processing the contents of the ping
   buffer, the driver can update the pong; and vice versa. Therefore,
   when the DMA controller auto-initializes, it will already have
   valid data available. This removes the click from the output sound.
<P>
   However, the 386 enhanced mode of Windows 3.0 does not support the
   auto-initialize mode of the DMA controller. Therefore, Multimedia
   Windows provides a virtual device driver (VxD) called VADMAD.386
   (virtual auto-initialize DMA device) that attaches itself to the
   virtual DMA device (VDMAD). Its purpose, as the name implies, is to
   support the auto-initialize mode of the DMA controller. However,
   VADMAD.386 does not fully support this mode -- it was designed only
   to correct the problem with the Sound Blaster. Because Windows 3.1
   supports auto-initialize DMA, do not use VADMAD with Windows 3.1.

<P><LI>Voice Input (Digital Sampling) Capability
<P>
   This is more commonly referred to as a digitizer. The Sound Blaster
   supports an 8-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with a variable
   sampling rate of ~4 KHz to ~12 KHz. The Multimedia Extensions to
   Windows requires a minimum sampling rate of 11 KHz. This provides
   sound quality approximately equal to that of normal voice phone
   lines.
<P>
   The Sound Blaster has a built-in microphone jack and amplifier with
   auto-gain control (AGC) for direct input (sampling) of sound. The
   microphone used should be ~600 ohms; AGC range 10 mV to 100 mV.
   This translates to "an inexpensive, low-end microphone."

<P><LI>Built-In Stereo Power Amplifier
<P>
   The Sound Blaster has a built-in amplifier that provides a maximum
   output of 4 watts per channel into a 4 ohm load. This is enough to
   drive an inexpensive set of headphones or some "Walkman" style
   speakers.
<P>
   And although the output is "stereo," the ONLY thing that is truly
   stereo on the Sound Blaster is the C/MS chip set (which Multimedia
   Windows does not use). All of those neat sounds played in
   Multimedia Windows are mono.

<P><LI>Built-in Game I/O Port
<P>
   This is a standard 15-pin D-Sub PC analog joystick adapter port.
   The Sound Blaster allows two joysticks to be connected through this
   port with the aid of a Y-cable (sold separately). The Multimedia
   Extensions to Windows can be configured to use this as two normal
   two-dimensional joysticks or one three-dimensional joystick.
<P>
   The only confusing part is Creative Lab's use of "I/O" for this
   joystick port. Joysticks are input devices only. The only output
   that this port provides is for MIDI (see part 7 below); this must
   be what Creative Labs was referring to.

<P><LI>Built-in MIDI Interface
<P>
   MIDI stands for musical instrument digital interface. Simply put,
   this is a protocol for connecting intelligent musical instruments
   and computers for the purpose of controlling the instruments in
   real time.
<P>
   To use the MIDI interface on the Sound Blaster, the MIDI connector
   box is required (sold separately). It plugs into the joystick port
   and has a pass-through for the joystick (so the joystick remains
   available). The MIDI connector box gives one MIDI-in and five
   MIDI-out connectors.
<P>
   With the version 1.x DSP, the MIDI port can be used only in
   half-duplex mode (one direction at a time). The version 2.0 DSP
   allows full-duplex operation, which allows playing and recording
   simultaneously (with the option of other accompanying instruments).
<P>
   The MCI-sequencer in Multimedia Windows allows use of the MIDI port
   or the AdLib (FM) synthesizer to play MIDI data. An external
   synthesizer will probably sound much better than the AdLib
   synthesizer and is therefore recommended.
