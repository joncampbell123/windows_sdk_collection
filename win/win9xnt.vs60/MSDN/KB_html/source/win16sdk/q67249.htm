The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.1 and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In the Microsoft Windows environment, custom controls are often
designed to store data about their state, color, or position. This
data can be stored directly in window extra bytes associated with the
custom control window or in a local or a global memory object.
<P>
If a control uses window extra bytes directly, Windows allocates
memory from the user heap, which is a scarce system resource shared by
all applications. In contrast, the LocalAlloc function allocates
memory from the heap of the application or the dynamic-link library
(DLL) in which the control is implemented.
<P>
If six or fewer bytes of data are required for each instance of a
custom control, the demand placed on the system user heap is not
large. In contrast, each window in Windows version 3.0 requires at
least 62 bytes of user heap; therefore, using a small number of window
extra bytes is easily justified.
<P>
If the control requires more than six bytes of data, the control class
should set the number of window extra bytes to the size of one HANDLE
data type. When the control is created, call the LocalAlloc function
to allocate enough memory to hold the data associated with the
control. Store the handle that LocalAlloc returns in the window extra
bytes.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Depending on the amount of storage required, storing a handle to a
local memory block in the window extra bytes is usually advantageous.
This method requires calling the LocalAlloc function once at
initialization time and calling the LocalLock and LocalUnlock
functions each time the control processes a message that refers to or
modifies any status information. Calling LocalLock and LocalUnlock is
much faster than calling GetWindowWord to access each item of data.
<P>
Storing a memory handle in the window extra bytes also provides the
control the option of using a global memory block if a very large
amount of data must be stored.
<P>
Using an allocated memory also allows the application to vary the
amount of data stored for each custom control by storing the size of
the structure or an index that describes the structure at the
beginning of the block of memory.
