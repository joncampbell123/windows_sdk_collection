<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Some combinations of modal and modeless dialog boxes create undesirable
side effects due to their design and implementation. This article describes
the side effects and methods to avoid them. The following list of side
effects may not be complete, and will be updated as additional side effects
are discovered.
<P>
<P><h3>Side Effects</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Unable to change focus with the keyboard if a modeless dialog box
   is created as the child of an active modal dialog box.

<P><LI>Unable to change focus with the keyboard if a modeless dialog box

   modal dialog box owned by the application's top-level window.

</OL>DLGS is a file in the Microsoft Software Library that demonstrates the
three side effects listed above, explains the causes of each, and
demonstrates the method listed below to avoid each problem.

</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Sections A and B below list some characteristics of the design and
implementation of modal and modeless dialog boxes. Section C below explains
the causes of the side effects listed above and techniques to avoid these
side effects.
<P>
<P><h3>Section A: Characteristics of a Modal Dialog Box</h3>
 

<UL><LI>A modal dialog box has its own message loop to process messages from
   the application's queue without involving the application's message
   loop. This private message loop is active as long as the modal
   dialog is active.

<LI>A modal dialog box disables its owner to prevent the owner from
   processing input. By default, a modal dialog box disables only one
   window; the other windows remain enabled and can process user input
   unless they are explicitly disabled.
<P>
</UL><h3>Section B: Characteristics of a Modeless Dialog Box</h3>
 

<UL><LI>A modeless dialog box does not disable its owner window. Therefore,
   the user can continue to work with the owner window while the
   modeless dialog box is displayed.

<LI>A modeless dialog receives its messages through the application's
   main message loop.

<LI>An application typically calls the IsDialogMessage() function to
   process keyboard input for the modeless dialog box. IsDialogMessage()
   handles changing the focus between controls using the keyboard.
<P>
</UL><h3>Section C: Explaining the Side Effects</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Side Effect 1</h3>
 
<P>
Symptoms
<P>
When a modeless dialog box is created as a child of a modal dialog
box, the keyboard cannot be used to change the focus.
<P>
Cause
<P>
The modal dialog box's message loop does not provide the functionality of
the IsDialogMessage() function.
<P>
Resolution
<P>
Substitute a modeless dialog box for the modal dialog box. To make the
parent modeless dialog box appear modal, disable its owner window in the
code to process the WM_INITDIALOG message.
<P>
When a modal dialog box is in its message loop, all windows in the
application, including each modeless dialog box, receive its messages from
the modal dialog box's message loop. However, this message loop does not
provide the functionality of IsDialogMessage().
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Side Effect 2</h3>
 
<P>
Symptoms
<P>
When a modeless dialog box is owned by a modal dialog box, the keyboard
cannot be used to change the focus.
<P>
Cause
<P>
The modal dialog box's message loop does not provide the functionality of
the IsDialogMessage() function.
<P>
Resolution
<P>
Substitute a modeless dialog box for the modal dialog box. To make the
parent modeless dialog box appear modal, disable its owner window in the
code to process the WM_INITDIALOG message.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Side Effect 3</h3>
 
<P>
Symptoms
<P>
If a modeless dialog box is destroyed during the processing of the
WM_INITDIALOG message for a modal dialog box owned by the application's top-
level window, the focus moves to another application.
<P>
Cause
<P>
No window is available to receive the focus.
<P>
Resolution
<P>
Substitute a modeless dialog box for the modal dialog box, as above.
Disable the owner window (to simulate modality) only after the modeless
dialog box is destroyed. Then Windows can put the input focus back to the
top window until the simulated modal dialog box is displayed.
<P>
Windows sends a WM_INITDIALOG message to a modal dialog box just before the
dialog is made visible. As part of destroying a window that has the input
focus, Windows removes the focus from the window and gives the focus to
another window. If the new modal dialog box destroys the modeless dialog
box as it processes a WM_INITDIALOG message, the modal dialog box is not
yet visible and cannot receive the input focus. Unless the application has
other visible windows, the only window that can receive the input focus is
the top-level window. However, because the top-level window owns the new
modal dialog box, it is disabled and cannot receive the input focus.
<P>
Because none of the active application's windows are eligible to receive
the input focus, Windows activates another application and gives the input
focus to one of its windows. When this other application receives the
focus, it moves to the front, over the application that created the modal
dialog box. As soon as the original application processes the WM_INITDIALOG
message, the modal dialog box is displayed and brought to the front.
<P>
The scenario above causes another application to be "sandwiched" between
the application's main window and the modal dialog box, which may confuse
the user. The following diagram illustrates the visual effect:

   |  | +---------------------------------------------------+ | |
