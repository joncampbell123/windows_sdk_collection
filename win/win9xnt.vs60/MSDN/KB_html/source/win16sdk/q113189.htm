<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In some cases, a user interface may require many dialog boxes to be present
at one time. It is possible to display these dialog boxes inside of an
owner-draw list box by moving the dialog boxes over the area that the list
box's items cover.
<P>
The LISTDLG sample demonstrates this method of displaying dialog boxes. The
sample uses a fixed height, owner-draw list box with a vertical scroll bar
to display several modeless dialog boxes. The scroll bar can be used to
scroll through the dialog boxes.
<P>
LISTDLG can be downloaded as a self-extracting file from the Microsoft
Software Library (MSL) on the following services:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Download Service (MSDL)

<P>
This sample demonstrates how to implement an owner-draw list box that
contains a list of modeless dialog boxes. The sample displays a dialog box
containing a list box with the LBS_OWNERDRAWFIXED style. It then creates
five modeless dialog boxes and places five entries in the list box. Then,
the sample associates a dialog box handle for each entry in the list box by
sending an LB_SETITEMDATA message to the list box for each list box entry.
<P>
The LISTDLG sample implements an owner-draw list box and shows how to
handle the WM_MEASUREITEM and the WM_DRAWITEM messages associated with the
list box. When a WM_DRAWITEM message is sent to the owner of the list box,
the appropriate modeless dialog box is moved via MoveWindow() to cover the
entire area of the list box item specified in the itemID field of the
DRAWITEMSTRUCT structure. To show which dialog box (list box item) is
currently selected, the WM_CTLCOLOR message is used to change the
background and text color of the dialog boxes. When a dialog box is
currently selected, its background color will be COLOR_HIGHLIGHT and its
text color will be COLOR_HIGHLIGHTTEXT.
<P>
The WM_MOUSEACTIVATE, WM_SETFOCUS, and WM_CTLCOLOR messages for the dialog
boxes are all handled by the following three generic functions in the
source file DIALOG.C:
<P>
<PRE>   BOOL HandleMouseActivate(int nIndex, HWND hDlg)
   BOOL HandleSetFocus(int nIndex, HWND hDlg)
   BOOL HandleCtlColor(int nIndex, HWND hDlg, WORD wParam, LONG lParam)

</PRE>The "nIndex" parameter is the zero-based list box item index associated
with the dialog box and hDlg is a handle to the dialog box. It is important
that all dialog boxes that are associated with the list box call these
functions when processing the above messages.
<P>
To select a dialog box from the list box, just click the left mouse button
anywhere on the dialog box, as you would do to select a normal list box
item. You can also scroll through the dialog boxes by using the scroll bar
on the list box. You can move from one dialog box to the next one in line
by choosing the Next button on any dialog box. The focus will scroll around
to the first dialog box in the list when the Next button of the last dialog
box is chosen. It is important that all dialog boxes that are associated
with the list box have a Next button so keyboard mobility is possible.
