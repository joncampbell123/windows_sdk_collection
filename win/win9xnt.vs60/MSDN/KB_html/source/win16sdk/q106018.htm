The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In a Windows 3.1 printing application, calling the SetPixel() command on a
device context created for the Windows PostScript printer driver version
3.56 or earlier causes the pixel that is drawn to be larger than expected
if a line with a thickness greater than 1 was drawn previously.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The PostScript driver's implementation of SetPixel() draws a circle with
the thickness set to the thickness of the last line drawn with the LineTo()
command if the thickness of the pen used is greater than 1.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the Windows PostScript
printer driver shipped with Windows 3.1. This problem has been corrected in
the PostScript driver for Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Instead of using the SetPixel() command, use the PatBlt() command to draw
the pixel. This is needed only if a pen of width greater than 1 was used to
draw lines with the Moveto() and LineTo() commands.
<P>
For example, if you were calling SetPixel() using the following line of
code to draw a black pixel at coordinates (10,10)
<P>
<PRE>   SetPixel(hPrnDC, 10, 10, RGB(0,0,0));

</PRE>instead of the above line of code, you could use PatBlt() in the following
way:
<P>
<PRE>   PatBlt(hPrnDC, 10, 10, 1, 1, BLACKNESS);

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Once a pen of thickness greater than 1 is created and selected into the
printer's device context and a LineTo() command is called, every call to
SetPixel() will result in a circle the width of the pen. If a pen of width
0 (zero) or 1 is created and used by the LineTo() command, the lines drawn
will be the correct thickness, but the SetPixel() command will still draw
with the thickness of the most recently used pen with a width greater than
1.
<P>
For example, the following code will draw the first two pixels correctly.
After the pen of width 50 is created and selected into the printer's device
context, the first call to SetPixel works correctly because LineTo() has
not been called yet. The call to SetPixel after the line is drawn results
in a circle the thickness of the line. After that, a pen of thickness 1 is
created and selected into the device context. The line drawn afterwards is
drawn correctly, but both calls to SetPixel() result in thick circles.
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Code</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>      if (StartDoc(hPrnDC,&amp;di) &gt; 0)
      {
         HPEN hPen, hPen2, hOldPen;

         StartPage(hPrnDC);
         hPen = CreatePen(PS_SOLID,1,RGB(0,0,0));
         hOldPen = SelectObject(hPrnDC,hPen);
         SetPixel(hPrnDC,100,10,RGB(0,0,0));
         MoveTo(hPrnDC,220,10);
         LineTo(hPrnDC,700,10);
         SetPixel(hPrnDC,800,10,RGB(0,0,0));

         hPen2 = CreatePen(PS_SOLID,50,RGB(0,0,0));
         SelectObject(hPrnDC,hPen2);
         SetPixel(hPrnDC,100,110,RGB(0,0,0));
         MoveTo(hPrnDC,220,110);
         LineTo(hPrnDC,700,110);
         SetPixel(hPrnDC,800,110,RGB(0,0,0));

         SelectObject(hPrnDC,hPen);
         SetPixel(hPrnDC,100,210,RGB(0,0,0));
         MoveTo(hPrnDC,220,210);
         LineTo(hPrnDC,700,210);
         SetPixel(hPrnDC,800,210,RGB(0,0,0));

         DeleteObject(hPen2);
         DeleteObject(SelectObject(hPrnDC,hOldPen));
         EndPage(hPrnDC);
         EndDoc(hPrnDC);
