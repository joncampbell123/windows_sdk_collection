The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.0 and 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To enhance the functionality of an existing Windows-based application, new
menu items can be added to the target application. The source application
that adds the new menu items can also respond to these menu items when they
are selected by a user. This article discusses the development of such a
source application and the pitfalls associated with using this type of
application.
<P>
There is sample code in the Software Library, in a file called SUBAPP, that
demonstrates the feature of adding menu items to another Windows-based
application.
<P>
Download SUBAPP.EXE, a self-extracting file, from the Microsoft Software
Library (MSL) on the following services:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Download Service (MSDL)
<P><PRE>      Dial (206) 936-6735 to connect to MSDL
      Download <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/subapp.exe">SUBAPP.EXE</A> <I>(size: 18261 bytes)</I> 
</PRE>
<LI>Internet (anonymous FTP)
<P><PRE>      ftp ftp.microsoft.com
      Change to the \SOFTLIB\MSLFILES directory
      Get <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/subapp.exe">SUBAPP.EXE</A> <I>(size: 18261 bytes)</I> 
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To monitor the menu items of another application, the main window of that
application is subclassed using the SetWindowLong() function. In the new
window function, WM_SYSCOMMAND messages should be processed to handle the
system menu items. If the menu items belong to a pop-up menu, WM_COMMAND
should be processed. All the other messages and unrelated menu messages
should be passed to the previous window function to maintain the integrity
of the target application.
<P>
After subclassing the target application, new menu items or new pop-up
menus can be added to it. To add menu items to the system menu or an
existing pop-up menu, AppendMenu() is called, and to add new pop-up menus,
InsertMenu() is called.
<P>
To make this process work in all three modes of Windows, a fixed code
dynamic-link library (DLL) should be used. The DLL should contain the
function that adds menu items and the new window function for the target
application. This is because the code associated with such a mechanism must
be available at all times. Certain EMS (expanded memory specification)
memory configurations place all code except fixed library code segments in
application-specific EMS memory. This makes the code availability limited
to the application that owns the EMS memory. If that code is not available
to the target application, it will crash under those EMS configurations.
<P>
NOTE: For future compatibility, the subclass procedure must be in a DLL for
all modes.
<P>
Care should be taken when assigning ID (identification) values to the new
menu items. The new ID values should not conflict with the values of the
existing menu items; otherwise, the old menu items will be disabled. To
determine the existing ID values of the target application, use SPY.EXE
(included with the Windows SDK) to monitor WM_MENUSELECT messages when
selecting menu items. The wParam parameter of WM_MENUSELECT message
contains the ID value of the menu item selected.
<P>
Some applications, such as Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word for Windows,
use more than one menu; that is, each application has an option to use a
long menu or a short one. These applications also allow their users to
customize the menus. These features could become a problem when subclassing
this type of application and monitoring new pop-up menus or new menu items.
<P>
For example, when subclassing Word for Windows, a new menu item is added
under the pop-up menu "Utility". Suppose that, when appending the new item,
the long version of the menu was selected. Later on, if the user changes to
the short version of the menu, the new added menu item will be lost because
Word for Windows would load the short version of its menus. To avoid this
problem, add menu items to the system menu of Word for Windows -- changing
the menu version does not effect the system menu.
<P>
Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word for Windows can also display the menu
items selected in a status window at the bottom. For this purpose, these
applications use the WM_MENUSELECT message. If these applications receive a
WM_MENUSELECT for a menu item that was not originally a part of their menu,
they could crash when they refresh the status window. For this reason, in
the new window function, WM_MENUSELECT messages related to all the new menu
items should not be passed to the target application's old window function.
<P>
If there are a lot of new menu items to be added to an application,
cascading menus should be used. Such a menu structure can help minimize the
number of commands on an original pop-up menu of the target application.
<P>
As previously stated, there is a sample in the Software Library called
SUBAPP that demonstrates the feature of adding menu items to another
Windows-based application. In WinMain of SUBAPP.EXE, FindWindow() is called
to get the handle of the desired application. If the application is present
in the system, its main-window is subclassed with a new function and two
new menu items are appended to its system menu. The new function monitors
the messages of the target application. If any of those messages relate to
the newly added menu items, the messages are handled accordingly;
otherwise, they are sent to the target application's original function.
<P>
If, on the other hand, the application is not present, a message hook is
installed to monitor the execution of the desired application. The message
hook waits for the WM_PAINT message to arrive for the desired window class.
<P>
Upon receiving a WM_PAINT for the desired application, the callback hook
function subclasses the other application and appends menu items to its
system menu. The hook function then posts a message to the calling
application (SUBAPP.EXE) to unhook the message filter, since there is no
longer a need for a system message hook.
<P>
If the other application quits before the termination of SUBAPP.EXE, a
message hook is set that again waits for the activation of the desired
application to append the menu items. If SUBAPP.EXE is closed before the
target application, the added menu items are removed and the application is
no longer subclassed.
<P>
The message hook, the subclassing function for the application, and all of
the menu appending and removing calls are placed in a fixed code DLL,
called LIBSUBAP.DLL. This guarantees that SUBAPP.EXE will work properly in
all of the three modes of Windows.
<P>
SUBAPP.EXE can be used to subclass any Windows-based application as long as
the class name of the target application's main window is known. In the
application's header file (SUBAPP.H), the constant OTHER_CLASS_NAME can be
initialized to the desired application's main-window class name.
