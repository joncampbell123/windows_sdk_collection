<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When an application is designed to gather a large amount of
information from the user, the application can quickly consume many
system resources due to the number of controls that it creates. Rather
than creating many of the same type of control, an application can
create one control and move it around.
<P>
The ONEEDIT sample in the Software/Data Library demonstrates this
technique.
<P>
Download ONEEDIT.EXE, a self-extracting file, from the Microsoft Software
Library (MSL) on the following services:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Download Service (MSDL)
<P><PRE>      Dial (206) 936-6735 to connect to MSDL
      Download <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/oneedit.exe">ONEEDIT.EXE</A> <I>(size: 36558 bytes)</I> 
</PRE>
<LI>Internet (anonymous FTP)
<P><PRE>      ftp ftp.microsoft.com
      Change to the \SOFTLIB\MSLFILES directory
      Get <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/oneedit.exe">ONEEDIT.EXE</A> <I>(size: 36558 bytes)</I>

consumed, query this Knowledge Base on the following words:

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
ONEEDIT demonstrates collecting data for multiple fields with a single
edit control. It collects the following data by moving one control:
<P>
<PRE>   Name (First, Middle, Last)
   Sex
   Social Security Number
   Birthday (Month, Day, Year)
   Address
   City
   State
   Zip Code
   Phone

</PRE>The results of using this technique are transparent to the user;
however, an application designed in this way consumes far fewer system
resources because one edit control is used rather than many edit
controls. Fifteen fewer controls are required by ONEEDIT because it
uses this technique. This savings becomes more significant as the
number of controls within an application increases.
<P>
The ONEEDIT source includes an application programmer's interface
(API) that can be added to an application. For more information on the
API, see the file API.TXT included in the ONEEDIT archive file.
<P>
The remainder of this article lists some of the other techniques
implemented in ONEEDIT.

<OL><P><LI>Mouse support
<P>
   - The application performs hit-testing to move the edit control
<P><PRE>     directly to any valid field.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Supports both TAB and SHIFT+TAB keys to move from one field to another
<P>
   - TAB: forward
   - SHIFT+TAB: backward

<P><LI>Input validation
<P>
   - If the value input for the State field does not correspond to a
<P><PRE>     valid two-letter state abbreviation (as defined by the U. S.
     Postal Service), a Help dialog box is displayed listing the valid
     abbreviations.
</PRE>   - Only a number (or a minus sign) is valid input in some fields
<P><PRE>     (Social Security Number, Birthday, Zip Code, and Phone fields).
</PRE>   - The value for the Sex field must be m, M, f, or F.

<P><LI>Special case processing to move between fields of the Phone number
<P>
   - Automatically advances to next phone field when one field is
<P><PRE>     filled.
</PRE>   - BACKSPACE moves to the preceding phone field (for example, from
<P><PRE>     the beginning of the prefix to the end of the area code).
</PRE>   - Arrow keys allow movement between fields.

<P><LI>Context-sensitive help in State field
<P>
   - The States Help can be invoked directly by pressing F2 when the
<P><PRE>     cursor is in the State field.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Icon automatically changes
<P>
   - The icon displayed in ONEEDIT client area changes depending on
<P><PRE>     the contents of the Sex field.
