<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Application Compatibility Document for Windows 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
Due to the amount of information in this document, it has been broken
into seven pieces. To find all seven pieces of this document and the
Windows 3.1 Compatibility Test checklist, query this knowledge base on
the words:
<P>
<PRE>   prod(winsdk) and 31compattest


                               TrueType
                               ========

</PRE>Although Windows version 3.1 includes support that seamlessly
integrates TrueType fonts into existing applications, problems with
fonts can occur for Windows version 3.0 applications that assume
bitmap fonts are always available, that Helv and Tms Rmn are always
available, and that font sizes are limited. Be sure to thoroughly
check fonts in your application, including files and dialogs. Also,
because TrueType provides more fonts at more sizes and in more styles,
Windows version 3.1 may consume both printer and global memory faster
than Windows version 3.0 did. Check your applications with systems and
printers that have limited memory.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>HELV AND TMS RMN FONTS</h3>
 
<P>
MS Sans Serif replaces Helv, and MS Serif replaces Tms Rmn. To support
Windows version 3.0 applications that use the Helv and Tms Rmn fonts,
the [FontSubstitutes] section in the WIN.INI file maps Helv to MS Sans
Serif and Tms Rmn to MS Serif by default. It also maps Times to Times
New Roman and Helvetica to Arial.
<P>
<P><h3>Potential Problem</h3>
 
<P>
Applications that hard code a search for Helv or Tms Rmn may encounter
difficulties after not finding these fonts.
<P>
<P><h3>Test</h3>
 
<P>
Examine your application code and be sure there are no dependencies on
the font names Helv and Tms Rmn.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>FONT ENUMERATION</h3>
 
<P>
Applications should test to ensure that TrueType fonts are enumerated
correctly and that they encounter no unexpected font mapping, such as
might occur when a TrueType font substitutes for another font and line
spacing changes and/or the position of text in documents is
recalculated.
<P>
Windows continues to support and is fully backward compatible with
ATM, Facelift, and Intellifont for Windows. Applications using these
other font technologies should encounter no problems.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>TRUETYPE ONLY CHECKED</h3>
 
<P>
Windows version 3.0 applications may behave unexpectedly if the user
has set the "Show Only TrueType Fonts in Applications" check box using
the Control Panel.
<P>
<P><h3>Potential Problem</h3>
 
<P>
An application may fail to locate any fonts if only TrueType fonts are
present.
<P>
<P><h3>Test</h3>
 
<P>
In the Control Panel, choose Fonts, select TrueType, and enable "Show
Only TrueType Fonts in Applications."

<UL><LI>Check the font dialog boxes in your application. It should list all
   the TrueType fonts and should not list non-TrueType fonts.
<P>
<P>
</UL><h3>FONT SIZES</h3>
 
<P>
TrueType supports a wide variety of sizes for all TrueType fonts. In
Windows version 3.1, an application usually gets the requested size if
it requests a very small or very large font.
<P>
<P><h3>Potential Problem</h3>
 
<P>
An application that checks for the smallest or largest font by setting
the nHeight parameter in CreateFont to an extreme value will not get
the expected results.
<P>
<P><h3>Test</h3>
 
<P>
Check fonts in dialog boxes, tool bars, and sample files for your
application. Be sure they are all readable.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>FONTSUBSTITUTES</h3>
 
<P>
The [FontSubstitutes] section may cause the GetTextFace function to
return a face name that the EnumFonts function does not enumerate.
This is done so that an application that asks for Helv (and expects
Helv) gets a font named Helv.
<P>
<P><h3>Potential Problem</h3>
 
<P>
An application that expects matching face names from the EnumFonts and
GetTextFace functions may encounter mismatches.
<P>
<P><h3>Test</h3>
 
<P>
Check the application code and be sure there are no dependencies on
GetTextFace and EnumFonts matching.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>ABC-SPACED FONTS</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Potential Problem</h3>
 
<P>
ABC-spaced fonts can lead to misplaced cursors, highlights that do not
encompass all the text on a line, "pieces" of characters left behind
after screen updates, and unexpected clipping of fonts on printers
(when a character goes outside the printable area).
<P>
<P><h3>Tests</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a document in your application that contains characters
   close to the edge of the screen and the printable margins. Scroll
   the document, checking for characters (or pieces of characters)
   left behind.

<P><LI>Highlight text. Be sure the highlight encompasses all characters
   and that no part of any character (especially the first and last
   characters) is left out.

<P><LI>Print the document. Be sure that no characters are clipped at the
   edges of the printable region.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h3>THIRD-PARTY TYPE MANAGER PROBLEMS</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Potential Problem</h3>
 
<P>
Be sure to try your application with ATM, Facelift, or Intellifont for
Windows fonts installed. Do not install more that one of these font
managers at a time. Skip this test if your application does not work
with these font managers under Windows version 3.0a.
<P>
<P><h3>Tests</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a document under Windows version 3.0a using a type manager
   (such as ATM), bitmap, and device fonts. Look at the document under
   Windows version 3.1, and be sure the screen appears the same.

<P><LI>Print the document with Windows versions 3.0a and 3.1, and be sure
   the output is identical.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h3>FONT ENUMERATION</h3>
 
<P>
Windows version 3.0 applications sometimes create multiple instances
of a single font or font family. In particular, some applications
handle fonts that a nonraster printer enumerates as different from
fonts enumerated for the display, even if the names are the same.
TrueType fonts with the same name are identical regardless of the
output device. Some Windows version 3.0 applications assume that
scalable fonts cannot be available on nonscaling devices. In such
cases, the applications intentionally enumerate a single size for
every TrueType font even though other sizes are available.
Furthermore, some applications assume that bold, italic, and bold
italic are always simulated from regular fonts. This is not true with
TrueType fonts.
<P>
<P><h3>Potential Problem</h3>
 
<P>
An application may create multiple instances of the same font.
<P>
<P><h3>Tests</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>If your application assumes that scalable fonts could not print on
   nonscalable devices, such as a PCL printer, it will have problems
   enumerating fonts. Check the font dialog boxes and sizes listed for
   TrueType fonts. Many sizes for each TrueType font should be listed.

<P><LI>TrueType fonts are shipped in regular, bold, italic, and bold
   italic. This can cause problems for applications that assume styles
   were always simulated. Check the font dialog boxes to be sure that
   each font is listed only once.

<P><LI>TrueType fonts appear for both printer and screen. This causes
   problems for applications that assume printer and screen fonts are
   always different. Select a nonraster printer (for example, PCL) and
   check the font dialog boxes to be sure each font is listed only
   once.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h3>MIXING DEVICE, BITMAP, AND TRUETYPE FONTS</h3>
 
<P>
In Windows version 3.1, some fonts, such as the Symbol font, may be
supported by a TrueType font, a GDI bitmap font, and a device-specific
font. Applications can get unexpected results when printing
waterfalls. For example, a Symbol waterfall to a dot matrix printer
intermixes the Symbol bitmap with TrueType Symbol. Because no Symbol
font is designed for dot matrix resolution, the results can be
spectacularly unattractive.
<P>
<P><h3>Potential Problem</h3>
 
<P>
Printing may mix device, bitmap, and TrueType fonts causing
unacceptable output.
<P>
<P><h3>Test</h3>
 
<P>
Create a document with a nonscalable printer installed, using a device
font and a TrueType font. Both fonts must have the same name. Print.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>DESKTOP PUBLISHING AND INTERNATIONAL CHARACTERS</h3>
 
<P>
Windows version 3.1 includes 22 new international and desktop
publishing characters. Unfortunately, these new characters appear only
in TrueType fonts; the bitmap fonts do not have them.
<P>
<P><h3>Potential Problem</h3>
 
<P>
Changing to a bitmap font causes the new characters to appear as
"blots." Some applications may remap the character code range (128 to
159).
<P>
<P><h3>Tests</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Use a TrueType font to create a document using the desktop
   publishing and international characters. Be sure the characters
   appear correctly on the screen.

<P><LI>Select a bitmap font, and then change to a TrueType font. Be sure
   the characters still appear correctly.

<P><LI>Print the document. Be sure the printout is correct.

<P><LI>Using the Char Map application in the Accessories group of Program
   Manager, use a TrueType font to copy the desktop publishing
   characters to the clipboard and paste them into your application.
   Be sure the characters appear correctly.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The desktop publishing characters will not be available to
dialog boxes that use bitmap fonts exclusively (such as the Find and
Replace dialog boxes).
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>TEXT ROTATION</h3>
 
<P>
Although Windows version 3.0 can rotate vector and device fonts, under
certain mapping modes it rotates these fonts differently. For
compatibility, Windows version 3.1 also rotates fonts differently.
However, an application can override this default behavior and direct
Windows version 3.1 to rotate all fonts the same by setting the
CLIP_LH_ANGLES bit in the lfClipPrecision member of the LOGFONT
structure. When this bit is set, Windows version 3.1 rotates all fonts
using the same left-hand rule as Windows version 3.0 uses to rotate
device fonts.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Some applications do not request point sizes correctly. For bitmap
   fonts, the results are acceptable because only these fonts have a
   limited range of sizes available. For TrueType fonts, output can be
   unacceptable because any size requested is available.

<LI>Applications sometimes set the tmCharWidth to request specific
   fonts, but Windows now stretches or compresses a TrueType font to
   match the requested width. Some applications make assumptions that
   work for bitmaps in many cases but that lead to squashed or clipped
   lines with TrueType fonts.

<LI>Windows version 3.1 adds 13 or more fonts to the default list. Some
   applications may break when more fonts of more types in more styles
   are enumerated. They do not have test cases that can account for
   the additional fonts.
