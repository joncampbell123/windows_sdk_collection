<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
GDIRSRCS is a file in the Microsoft Software Library that demonstrates the
following three techniques:

<OL><P><LI>Reading a device independent bitmap (DIB) resource from a file and
   using that data to create one of the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - A device dependent bitmap (DDB)
    - A cursor
    - An icon
</PRE>
<P><LI>Reading a cursor resource from a file and using that data to create
   one of the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - A device dependent bitmap
    - A device independent bitmap
    - An icon
    - Another cursor
</PRE>
<P><LI>Reading an icon resource from a file and using that data to create
   one of the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - A device dependent bitmap
    - A device independent bitmap
    - A cursor
    - Another icon
</PRE><P>
</OL>Download GDIRSRCS.EXE, a self-extracting file, from the
Microsoft Software Library (MSL) on the following services:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Download Service (MSDL)
<P><PRE>      Dial (206) 936-6735 to connect to MSDL
      Download <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/gdirsrcs.exe">GDIRSRCS.EXE</A> <I>(size: 51017 bytes)</I> 
</PRE>
<LI>Internet (anonymous FTP)
<P><PRE>      ftp ftp.microsoft.com
      Change to the \SOFTLIB\MSLFILES directory
      Get <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/gdirsrcs.exe">GDIRSRCS.EXE</A> <I>(size: 51017 bytes)</I> 
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Reading icon and cursor resources from a file is straightforward.
However, reading a device independent bitmap resource from a file is
not so straightforward for the following two reasons:

<UL><LI>The bitmap may be larger than 64K bytes. Therefore, an application
   must use a custom file-reading function that can deal with the
   64K-byte limit.

<LI>The device independent bitmap resource-file header has two
   different formats: one for OS/2 and another for Windows version 3.x.
   While the GDIRSRCS sample reads both formats, it stores bitmap
   information only in the Windows 3.x format.
<P>
</UL><h3>Creating a Device Dependent Bitmap</h3>
 
<P>
The process to create a DDB using the information in a DIB is
straightforward. Call the CreateBitmap() function to create a bitmap,
then read the image data from the DIB into the DDB.
<P>
Creating a DDB from a cursor or from an icon is also straightforward.
Note that a cursor and an icon each contain two bitmaps (the AND and
XOR bit masks) in a DIB. Extract the XOR bit mask and use it to create
a DDB.
<P>
In the GDIRSRCS sample, the functions that create bitmaps are in the
BMP.C file.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating a Cursor</h3>
 
<P>
In the GDIRSRCS sample, the functions that create cursors are in the
CUR.C file.
<P>
The procedure to create a cursor based on a DIB obtained from a cursor
or icon resource file has eight steps. While the following discussion
describes the process of creating a cursor based on a DIB from an icon
file, the procedure to create a cursor based on a DIB from another
cursor is the same.

<OL><P><LI>Obtain a pointer to the bits of the device independent bitmap from
   the icon.

<P><LI>Divide the height of the DIB by two because the DIB contains both
   the AND and XOR masks.

<P><LI>Calculate the offset to the AND mask bits.

<P><LI>Calculate the offset to the XOR mask bits.

<P><LI>Create a device dependent monochrome bitmap with the bits of the
   XOR mask.

<P><LI>Obtain the contents of the device dependent XOR bit mask and store
   it in memory. The AND bit mask is a monochrome bitmap. Because
   device independent and device dependent monochrome bitmaps share
   the same format, there is no need to convert the AND bit mask.

<P><LI>Because the image of a DIB is stored from bottom to top, flip the
   scanlines of the AND bit mask.

<P><LI>Create a cursor by calling the CreateCursor() function, specifying the
   AND and XOR bit masks.
<P>
</OL>To create a cursor from a bitmap DIB, use the following eight steps:

<OL><P><LI>Obtain a handle to the DIB in the bitmap.

<P><LI>Call the GetSystemMetrics() function with the SM_CXCURSOR and
   SM_CYCURSOR indexes to determine the width and height of cursors
   supported by the installed video driver.

<P><LI>Change the size of the bitmap to match the size of the system's
   cursors.

<P><LI>If the bitmap is a color bitmap, convert it to monochrome. (All
   cursors are monochrome.)

<P><LI>Save the XOR mask bits in memory.

<P><LI>Create a monochrome bitmap for the AND bit mask. Fill it with any
   desired pattern.

<P><LI>Save the AND mask bits in memory.

<P><LI>Create a cursor by calling the CreateCursor() function, specifying the
   AND and XOR bit masks.
<P>
</OL><h3>Creating Icons</h3>
 
<P>
In the GDIRSRCS sample, the functions that create icons are in the
ICON.C file.
<P>
The process to create an icon from a cursor or from another icon
resource file has eight steps. While the following discussion
describes the process of creating an icon based on a cursor, the
process to create an icon based on another icon is the same.

<OL><P><LI>Obtain a pointer to the bits of the DIB in the cursor.

<P><LI>Divide the height of the DIB by two because the DIB contains both
   the AND and XOR bitmaps.

<P><LI>Calculate the offset to the AND mask bits.

<P><LI>Calculate the offset to the XOR mask bits.

<P><LI>Create a device dependent monochrome bitmap with the bits of the
   XOR mask.

<P><LI>Obtain the contents of the device dependent XOR bit mask and store
   it in memory. The AND bit mask is a monochrome bitmap. Because
   device independent and device dependent monochrome bitmaps share
   the same format, there is no need to convert the AND bit mask.

<P><LI>Because the image of a DIB is stored from bottom to top, flip the
   scanlines of the AND bit mask.

<P><LI>Create a cursor by calling the CreateCursor() function, and specifying
   the AND and XOR bit masks.
<P>
</OL>To create an icon from a bitmap DIB, use the following seven steps:

<OL><P><LI>Obtain a handle to the DIB in the bitmap.

<P><LI>Call the GetSystemMetrics() function with the SM_CXICON and SM_CYICON
   indexes to determine the width and height of icons supported by the
   installed video driver.

<P><LI>Change the size of the bitmap to match the size of the system's
   icons.

<P><LI>Save the XOR mask bits in memory.

<P><LI>Create a monochrome bitmap for the AND bit mask. Fill it with any
   desired pattern.

<P><LI>Save the AND mask bits in memory.

<P><LI>Create an icon by calling the CreateIcon() function, and specifying
   the AND and XOR bit masks.
