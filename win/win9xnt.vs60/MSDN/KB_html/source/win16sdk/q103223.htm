Ripwatch: Traps System RIPs and Other Notification Messages
<P>
Ripwatch uses the TOOLHELP dynamic-link library (DLL) to trap system
RIPs and other notification messages, and displays them in a window.
<P>
When developing Microsoft(R) Windows(TM)-based applications, you
should always use the debugging version of Windows. This special build
of the system is distributed with the Windows Software Development Kit
(SDK). It tests for invalid parameters to Windows function calls and
reports other problems such as failing to free graphics device
interface (GDI) objects when an application exits. If you don't know
about the debugging version, you are not getting the most from your
SDK; worse still, you may be preparing to ship a potentially faulty
product.
<P>
The default action for reporting detected errors is to send a message
to a debug terminal connected to COM1. This requires that you have a
terminal attached to the port to see these messages. This can be a
waste of desktop space, a source of annoying beeps,and may tie up an
otherwise useful communications port. The TOOLHELP.DLL included with
the Windows SDK allows you to hook these messages before they reach
the communications port. The Ripwatch sample application displays the
messages in a window. The display includes a textual description of
the RIP error code. Ripwatch also allows you to copy the text to the
Clipboard, save it in a file, or print it.
<P>
There is a known problem when running Ripwatch with Microsoft
CodeView(R) for Windows. If you try to start CodeView while Ripwatch
is running, CodeView reports an out-of-memory condition. If you try to
start Ripwatch after CodeView has been started, CodeView will usually
GP fault.
<P>
Ripwatch was built and tested under Microsoft Windows version 3.1 and
the Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0 compiler.
