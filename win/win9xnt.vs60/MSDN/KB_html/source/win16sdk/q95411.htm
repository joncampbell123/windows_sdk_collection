</PRE><h2>ABOUT THIS COURSE</h2>
 
<P>
This self-study course is one of a series of courses developed by Microsoft
Technical Support Worldwide Training to help software engineers develop
expertise in areas of Windows that they have not previously explored. The
course focuses on common programming errors, common troubleshooting
scenarios, documentation errors, and Windows issues, in addition to
common application programming techniques. This course was designed
and the technical content supplied by engineers who provide developers
with Windows programming support. The information included here has
been determined by these specialists to be what you need to know about
this topic in order to successfully implement it into your
application.
<P>
<P><h2>WHAT YOU WILL LEARN</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>After completing this course, you will:</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Describe what palettes are and why it is beneficial to implement
   palette support in an application.
<LI>Explain the function of the data types, structures, and messages
   related to palette support.
<LI>Explain the concepts related to foreground and background palettes
   and realization.
<LI>Explain the concepts related to System Colors.
<LI>Explain the palette management techniques used to support
   animation.
<P>
</UL><h2>INSTALLING THE SELF-STUDY MODULE</h2>
 
<P>
First, copy PW0777.EXE to the directory that the course is to be
installed in. Change to that directory and enter the following
command:
<P>
<PRE>   PW0777

</PRE>Next, unzip CLASS.EXE, a self-extracting file, and create the
appropriate directory structure by using the "-d" switch as in the
following command:
<P>
<PRE>   class -d

</PRE><h3>Directory Structure</h3>
 
<P>
The directory structure that is created has a LABS subdirectory and a
TRAINING subdirectory. The TRAINING subdirectory contains a help file
for the self-study course, a compiled version of the sample code, and
a .DLL (dynamic-link library) for the Print All feature. The LABS
subdirectory contains a subdirectory for each of the labs used in this
course. In each of the individual lab subdirectories there is a
DONECODE and a BASECODE subdirectory. The BASECODE subdirectory
contains the code for the lab; the student modifies this code to get
the desired results. The DONECODE directory contains the code for the
solutions to the lab.
<P>
<P><h3>Getting Started</h3>
 
<P>
Once you have successfully installed the self-study module, run
Windows and bring up the File Manager. Go to the TRAINING subdirectory
in the directory that you installed the self-study module in and
double-click the PAL.HLP file. This will run the Windows Help engine
and load the self-study module. You are now ready to begin the course.
<P>
<P><h3>Print All Feature</h3>
 
<P>
This self-study course has the option to "Print All" (a choice from
the File menu). This menu selection prints the entire contents of the
.HLP file containing the course.
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: Due to design limitations of the Help engine, there is no way
   to abort this feature and all hardware input will be disabled while
   printing all. In addition, you cannot "print to file" using this
   feature; the print job MUST go directly to the printer.
