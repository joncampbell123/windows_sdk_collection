<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.1 and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Under Windows version 3.1, the first time a private profile (.INI file) is
accessed, the system will call the GetFileTime() API and store this value.
The WriteProfileString() API will then call the GetFileTime() API and
compare the return value to the stored value. If the two values match, the
file is considered valid for two seconds. The function makes the changes
and writes the new contents to disk. If the two values do not match, the
profile is reread into a buffer and the change is made. The same principle
holds true for reading values from a private profile.
<P>
The reasoning behind the two second limit is that most applications read
private profiles in a burst, at application startup, and write in a burst,
at application shutdown. The penalty of one read in a twenty read sequence
is considered acceptable, given the benefits.
<P>
In Windows version 3.0, an application that has a private profile will not
respond to changes made to that private profile by a text editor. When a
text editor updates a private profile, the file on disk is modified.
However, GetPrivateProfileString() and GetPrivateProfileInt() do not read
from the disk file, instead the functions read from a copy of the file in a
cache. WritePrivateProfileString() will update the appropriate sections in
both the cached file and the disk file, however, the functions will not
reload the disk file into the cache unless the entire cache is invalidated.
The information included below discusses how to force a private profile to
be recached from a disk file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows caches .INI files to reduce access time. This design allows
the file to remain in memory until a different .INI file is loaded or
until an application forces recaching of the file.
<P>
To force an .INI file to be recached, make the following call (where
&lt;fname.ini&gt; is the name of the application's private profile):
<P>
<PRE>   WritePrivateProfileString(NULL, NULL, NULL, &lt;fname.ini&gt;)

</PRE>This call will force the entire .INI file that is in the cache to be
invalidated. The next call to either GetPrivateProfileString() or
GetPrivateProfileInt() will cause the disk file to be recached.
<P>
While .INI files are cached to optimize access time, the following are
examples of how and when an .INI file could be recached.

<OL><P><LI>The application could update the cache from disk each time the
   application requires information from the profile. Calling the
   WritePrivateProfileString function as outlined above would clear
   the cache.
<P>
   NOTE: Because the file is recached with every access, the benefit
   of the cache is lost with this method.

<P><LI>Create a separate program or function that the user would invoke to
   explicitly invalidate the cache. The following is some code for
   that purpose that could be placed into the GENERIC sample
   application supplied with the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK):
<P>
   BOOL InitInstance(HANDLE hInstance, int nCmdShow)
   {
<P><PRE>      LPSTR lpApplicationName, lpKeyName, lpDefault, lpReturnedString;
<PRE></PRE>      int   nSize;

      /* initialize variables */
      ...

      WritePrivateProfileString(NULL, NULL, NULL, "MY.INI");
      GetPrivateProfileString(lpApplicationName, lpKeyName,
         lpDefault, lpReturnedString, nSize, "MY1.INI");
      MessageBox(NULL, "Cache Refreshed", szApp,
         MB_ICONINFORMATION | MB_OK);
      return TRUE;
   }

   Using a program or function like this will cause the .INI file to be
   recached only when it is changed by an editor, therefore the benefit
   of the cache is retained. However, it is necessary for the user to
   call another application or function after the profile is changed
   with an editor.

</PRE><P><LI>If neither of these techniques is suitable, the application could
   check the time and date stamp on the .INI file before each access to
   see if cache invalidation is necessary. This option provides the
   benefits of the cache without requiring the user to call another
   program. The overhead required to read the time and date stamp is
   minimal compared to recaching the file with every call to either
   the GetPrivateProfileString or GetPrivateProfileInt functions.
