</PRE><h2>ABOUT THIS COURSE</h2>
 
<P>
This self-study course is one of a series of courses developed by Microsoft
Technical Support Worldwide Training to help software engineers develop
expertise in areas of Windows that they have not previously explored. As a
result, the course focuses on and highlights common programming errors,
common troubleshooting scenarios, documentation errors, and Windows issues
in addition to common application programming techniques. This course
was designed, and the technical content was provided, by the engineers
currently providing developers with Windows programming support. The
information included here is what these specialists have determined,
through experience, that you need to know about this topic in order to
successfully implement it into your application.
<P>
<P><h2>WHAT YOU WILL LEARN</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>After completing this course, you will:</h3>
 

<UL><LI>be able to describe the common dialogs provided by Windows 3.1.
<LI>be able to effectively use existing reference materials and samples
   to solve common dialog programming problems.
<LI>be able to use direct calls to the common dialog API to correctly
   display and retrieve information from each common dialog.
<LI>be able to customize the behavior and appearance of a common dialog
   through the use of hook functions and custom templates.
<LI>be able to describe and answer the common customer questions
   related to common dialog programming issues.
<P>
</UL><h2>INSTALLING THE SELF-STUDY MODULE</h2>
 
<P>
First, copy PW0740.EXE to the directory that the course is to be
installed. Change to that directory and enter the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   PW0740

</PRE>Next, unzip CLASS.EXE, a self-extracting file, and create the
appropriate directory structure by using the "-d" switch as in the
following command:
<P>
<PRE>   class -d

</PRE><h3>Getting Started</h3>
 
<P>
Once you have successfully installed the training, run Windows and
bring up the File Manager. Go to the directory that you installed the
training in, and double click on the COMMDLG.HLP file. This will run
the Help Engine, and load the training module. You are now ready to
begin the course.
<P>
<P><h3>Directory Structure</h3>
 
<P>
The directory structure that will be created will have a LABS
subdirectory and a TRAINING subdirectory. The TRAINING subdirectory
will contain a help file for the printing course, a compiled version
of the sample code, and a .DLL for the Print All feature. The LABS
subdirectory will contain a subdirectory for each of the labs used in
this course. In each of the individual lab subdirectories, there is a
DONECODE and a BASECODE subdirectory. The BASECODE subdirectory
contains the code for the lab that the student needs to modify to get
the desired results. The DONECODE directory contains the code for the
solutions to the lab.
<P>
<P><h3>Print All Feature</h3>
 
<P>
This self-study course has the option to "Print All" (a choice from
the file menu). This menu selection will print the entire contents of
the .HLP file that contains the course. Due to design limitations of
the help engine, there is no way to abort this feature and all
hardware input will be disabled while printing all. In addition, you
cannot "Print to file" using this feature, the print job *must* go
directly to the printer.
