<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.1 and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows and Windows 95 do not support 16-bit Windows-based applications
coded with OS/2 Family API (FAPI) calls.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
FAPI works in the following manner:

<OL><P><LI>The code contains references to OS/2 FAPI calls (such as DosOpen,
   DosRead, and so on).

<P><LI>When the program is loaded into OS/2 protected mode, the system
   loader dynamically links the FAPI calls to the OS/2 system-services
   DLLs (Dynamic-Link Libraries).

<P><LI>When the program is loaded into real mode (MS-DOS or OS/2
   compatibility box), what actually gets loaded is a small program
   called the "FAPI Loader and Linker." It is this program that loads
   the real code; it dynamically links the FAPI calls to a special
   library of support routines that translate FAPI calls into 80x86
   code and MS-DOS interrupts (INT 21H Function xx).
<P>
</OL>This process is also described on Page 251 of Gordon Letwin's book
titled "Inside OS/2" (Microsoft Press, 1988).
<P>
FAPI works well for programs that need to run in MS-DOS and OS/2
protected mode. The problem is that Windows uses the "New EXE Format"
for programs, bypassing the standard MS-DOS entry point. For example,
if a Windows program is run outside of Windows (in MS-DOS), the
following message appears, and the program terminates:
<P>
<PRE>   This program requires Microsoft Windows

</PRE></OL>MS-DOS is not responsible for this message; the Windows program itself
is responsible. The way the Windows program works is very similar to
OS/2: it uses dual entry points into the .EXE file. In MS-DOS, a short
program that prints the above message runs; however, in Windows, a
true Windows-based application runs using the other entry point in the .EXE
file.
<P>
Therefore, the problem is narrowed down to the following: if the FAPI
Loader and Linker program is run using the standard MS-DOS .EXE file
entry point, and Windows starts an application using a different entry
point, the dynamic linking of the FAPI routines will not occur.
<P>
Therefore, FAPI calls cannot be used in Windows-based applications.
<P>
To avoid this problem, do the following:
<P>
Instead of using low-level MS-DOS calls (INT 21H Function xx) in a
Windows-based application and OS/2 API calls (DosRead, DosOpen, and so
on) in a Presentation Manager (PM) application, use the C run-time I/O
routines for all of these applications.
<P>
This will work because the Microsoft C Compiler and the run-time
libraries supply versions of the libraries that work in both OS/2 and
MS-DOS. By moving C code to PM and to Windows, it will not be
necessary to rewrite it, and the appropriate conversion routines will
be supplied at link time.
<P>
Be sure not to use high-level (stream) I/O routines in C with Windows;
just use the low-level (handles) versions. This topic is discussed in
Charles Petzold's book titled "Programming Windows" (Microsoft Press,
1988), and in other articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.
