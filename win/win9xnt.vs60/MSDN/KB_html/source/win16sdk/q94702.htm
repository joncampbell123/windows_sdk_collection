<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article is designed to give the reader a general introduction to the
functionality of the Windows for Pen Computing pen driver and virtual pen
driver, and helps to explain why the drivers function as they do. This
article is an overview that should be read in conjunction with the article
titled
<P>
<PRE>   "Understanding Pen Driver Functionality Under Windows"

</PRE>It is assumed the reader has some understanding of the Intel 386 chip
architecture and is familiar with Windows device drivers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>DEVELOPING WINDOWS FOR PEN COMPUTING PEN DRIVERS: AN OVERVIEW</h3>
 
<P>
Pen drivers are hardware-dependent Windows DLLs (dynamic-link libraries)
and virtual drivers that are responsible for detecting, enabling,
disabling, reading, and commanding stylus hardware attached to a Windows
for Pen Computing computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Why Pen Drivers Are Necessary</h3>
 
<P>
At first glance, the pen may seem to be very similar to a mouse; it can
report X and Y information and it has buttons. It would be relatively easy
for a developer to write a mouse driver that turned all pen input into
mouse events for Windows. Unfortunately, there are two problems with using
this approach in Windows for Pen Computing.
<P>
First, pens can generate much more information than just X, Y, and button
status. Some pens generate pressure information, some detect changes in pen
angle, and some detect whether the pen has left the sensing area of the
tablet. Because regular Windows provides no mechanism for communicating
this additional information, Windows for Pen Computing standardized a way
for this new information to be fed to the Windows system.
<P>
Second, it is natural to think of a pen as a useful device for entering
handwritten data. However, several features of Windows mouse processing are
detrimental to handwriting recognition. For example, Windows collapses
WM_MOUSEMOVE messages making it impossible for a handwriting recognizer to
obtain all of the relevant data from the pen. This implies that Windows for
Pen Computing must store data from the pen itself so that all of it is
available to perform handwriting recognition. Given this and other
limitations, a pen driver must behave differently than a mouse driver--
using a Windows for Pen Computing interface to record pen input.
<P>
Windows for Pen Computing provides the required flexible method for pen
drivers to send all appropriate pen information from the pen to a new DLL,
PENWIN.DLL. This new DLL handles the archiving of pen data, generation of
mouse events, ink drawing, recognizer management, and other hardware-
independent aspects of pen computing.
<P>
<P><h3>Pen Versus Mouse</h3>
 
<P>
There are several differences between a pen driver and a mouse driver. Here
are a few:
<P>

</PRE><h3>STRUCTURE OF A PEN DRIVER</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Installable Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
Windows version 3.1 provides an installable driver mechanism for loading
DLLs at Windows boot time. Each DLL generally handles the interface between
the Windows system and a specific hardware device. All installable drivers
have a message handler, DriverProc, that processes messages sent by the
Windows system or various interested programs. For more information on
Windows system messages to installable device drivers, see the Windows 3.1
Device Driver Development Kit (DDK).
<P>
<P><h3>Installable Pen Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
The driver that handles pen input in standard mode Windows is an
installable driver. While most of the message handling done by the
installable pen driver is identical to that done by any installable driver,
there are a few notes that will prove useful to the pen driver developer,
as well as a few new messages specific to pen drivers.
<P>
<P><h3>DRV_LOAD</h3>
 
<P>
This message is sent once when the standard mode driver is loaded. At this
time, pen drivers should consult any .INI files for specific parameters,
fill in global data structures (such as PENINFO) that will be referenced
later, allocate any segments/memory/real-mode callbacks that need to be
allocated, and finally return a 1 (one) if everything went well.
<P>
<P><h3>DRV_ENABLE</h3>
 
<P>
This message is sent when Windows is booting and when standard mode Windows
switches from a full screen MS-DOS session back to Windows. When a pen
driver gets this message, it should manipulate any appropriate I/O ports,
reset the tablet, hook any appropriate interrupts, and enable any
appropriate IRQs (interrupt requests) at the PIC (programmable interrupt
controller) so the pen will start generating information.
<P>
<P><h3>DRV_OPEN</h3>
 
<P>
When an installable driver gets an Open message, that generally means some
other program wants to get the address of some entry points in the driver.
The polite thing to do in this case is to return a 1.
<P>
<P><h3>DRV_CLOSE</h3>
 
<P>
This is the opposite of the Open message. While the return value probably
doesn't matter, the polite thing to do is to return a 1.
<P>
<P><h3>DRV_DISABLE</h3>
 
<P>
This message occurs when Windows is exiting or when standard mode Windows
switches from graphics mode to a full screen MS-DOS session. When
processing the message, a pen driver should unhook any interrupts that were
hooked at enable time and return all modified I/O ports to their original
state.
<P>
<P><h3>Other DRV_Messages</h3>
 
<P>
The following messages are usually NOPs in the sample drivers because
Microsoft is often not given the complete documentation on a tablet. In a
finished OEM product, a driver must support and implement these messages.
These messages are documented in Appendix B of the "Microsoft Windows for
Pen Computing: Programmer's Reference" supplied with the Windows version
3.1 SDK.
<P>
<PRE>   DRV_SetPenSamplingRate
   DRV_SetPenSamplingDist
   DRV_SetEntryPoints
   DRV_RemoveEntryPoints
   DRV_GetName
   DRV_GetVersion
   DRV_GetPenInfo
   DRV_GetCalibration
   DRV_SetCalibration
   DRV_QUERYCONFIGURE

</PRE>The following three messages may or may not be supported by a pen driver
for Windows for Pen Computing version 1.0. In future versions, these
messages will be required. Take a look in INSTALL.ASM for their defined
values, and look in PLAY.ASM for their functionality.
<P>
<PRE>   Message             Function
   -------            --------

   DRV_PenPlayStart   Places the pen driver into "playback" mode.
   DRV_PenPlayBack    The driver is given an array of pen packets to play.
   DRV_PenPlayStop    Restores the driver back into its normal state.


</PRE><h3>PEN DRIVER ARCHITECTURE NOTES</h3>
 
<P>
The following are miscellaneous notes about the structure of the pen
drivers, issues to be considered during driver development, and so forth.
<P>
<P><h3>Interrupt Handling</h3>
 
<P>
When interrupts arrive, pen drivers should collect any information from the
tablet. If enough information is available, the pen driver should:

<OL><P><LI>Put the information into a pen packet structure.
</OL>2. Set DS:SI to point to the structure.
3. Disable pen interrupts.
4. Call the AddPenEvent entry point in PENWIN.DLL.
5. Enable pen interrupts.
6. Call the ProcessPenEvent entry point in PENWIN.DLL.
<P>
The AddPenEvent function call quickly records the contents of the pen
packet in a queue of pen packets inside of PENWIN.DLL. The function is
fast, but it must be called with interrupts turned off because it is not re-
entrant. The ProcessPenEvent entry point handles all of the inking and
other internal "management" of the pen data. While it is relatively slow,
this function is re-entrant so interrupts need not be disabled when it is
called.
<P>
The combination of AddPenEvent() and ProcessPenEvent() allows a pen driver
to leave interrupts disabled for the shortest time possible. This
guarantees that no data from the pen is lost due to interrupt flooding and
results in smooth inking and higher recognition rates.
<P>
<P><h3>Interrupt Code; CS=DS</h3>
 
<P>
All code that runs at interrupt time in the pen driver is in the data
segment. This is done for memory management reasons. The data segment of a
pen driver must always be fixed in memory; otherwise, its data won't be
accessible at interrupt time. If the interrupt code is put into a code
segment, then that code segment must also be fixed. This is a waste of a
segment, and perhaps also a waste of fixed memory. Thus the interrupt code
was put into the data segment, conserving the most amount of memory and
segment allocations.
<P>
<P><h3>PENWIN.DLL Not Loaded and Not Present</h3>
 
<P>
Pen drivers should always notify the Windows system when the pen state
(position, pressure, and so forth) has changed. Normally this is
accomplished by calling the AddPenEvent/ProcessPenEvent entry points in
PENWIN.DLL. Due to loading-order issues however, pen drivers must not
import these entry points directly. Rather, pen drivers should perform the
fixup to these functions on the fly.
<P>
When PENWIN.DLL is loaded and ready to accept calls to its pen event entry
points, it sends the pen driver a DRV_SetPenDriverEntryPoints message. At
this point, the pen driver should get the address of the AddPenEvent and
ProcessPenEvent APIs in PENWIN.DLL via GetProcAddress().
<P>
When PENWIN.DLL may not accept any more calls to its pen event entry points
(because it is getting unloaded, for example), it will send the pen driver
a DRV_RemovePenDriverEntryPoints message. In response to this message, a
pen driver should cease calling AddPenEvent() and ProcessPenEvent() because
these entry points are invalid upon receipt of the
RV_RemovePenDriverEntryPoints message.
<P>
If PENWIN.DLL is not accepting calls to its pen event entry points, either
because it has yet to call DRV_SetDriverEntryPoints or it has called
DRV_RemovePenDriverEntryPoints, then pen drivers must call the MOUSE_EVENT
entry point in USER every time the pen status has changed. This ensures
that mouse behavior is available from the pen even if inking/handwriting
behavior is not.
<P>
<P><h3>Orientation</h3>
 
<P>
Windows for Pen Computing supports the notion of multiple display
orientations, for example, portrait and landscape modes. The current
display orientation is stored in the "DisplayOrientation" field in the
[Display Driver] section of the SYSTEM.INI file. The DisplayOrientation key
is an integer from 0 to 3, which specifies which corner of the screen is
now the upper-left corner of the display.
<P>
DisplayOrientation Value  Meaning
------------------------  -------
<P>
<PRE>0                          Display oriented normally.
1                          Old upper-right corner now upper-left corner;
                           +90.
2                          Display is upside down; +180.
3                          Old lower-left corner now upper-left corner;
                           +270.

</PRE></OL>A pen driver must read the display orientation value and orient itself so
the width and height values in the PENINFO structure are correct and all X,
Y information reported in pen packets has its origin in the upper-left
corner of the logical display. That is, it must ensure that regardless of
the coordinates reported by the physical device, that the X, Y information
reported reflects the orientation of the Windows desktop on the display
device.
<P>
Because orientation can be changed only at Windows startup, the orientation
key must be read only at DRV_LOAD time.
<P>
<P><h3>Re-Entrancy</h3>
 
<P>
As stated above, AddPenEvent() is fast but not re-entrant and
ProcessPenEvent() is not fast but is re-entrant. The recommended way of
using these functions is to enable pen interrupts [that is, send an EOI
(end of interrupt) to the PIC (programmable interrupt controller)] after
the call to AddPenEvent(), but before the call to ProcessPenEvent().
<P>
If pen interrupts are enabled before the call to AddPenEvent(), a pen
driver runs the risk of re-entering AddPenEvent(). If pen interrupts are
not enabled before the call to ProcessPenEvent(), the pen driver runs the
risk of data overflow.
<P>
<P><h3>Filtering</h3>
 
<P>
Sometimes tablets need to filter pen packets before they are submitted to
Windows for Pen Computing. This might be necessary to remove spurious data
from the digitizing hardware, for example. The default filter distributed
in FILTER.ASM ensures that each pen packet is followed by two pen packets
with similar data before it gets submitted for processing. Some tablets
need less or no filtering, while other tablets need much more extensive
filtering that takes into account velocity and acceleration. The function
provided is fairly basic and the OEM is free to enhance it as appropriate
for the digitizing hardware concerned.
<P>
<P><h3>Speak Up/Shut Up Modes</h3>
 
<P>
An interesting problem arises in some tablets that can sense when the pen
goes out of range. Tablets can respond to a pen going out of range in two
ways. They can send only one out-of-range packet ("shut up mode"), or
continuously send out-of-range packets ("speak up mode"). If the tablet is
in shut up mode and the out-of-range packet is lost for some reason, then
the system is in an incorrect state--it will have missed the state
transition to out-of-range. If a tablet is in speak up mode, then the
system is continuously interrupted by the tablet when there is no new
information--at least no important information. This is a performance
problem because it floods the system with useless data.
<P>
The sample serial driver in the Windows for Pen Computing DDK resolves this
potential problem by putting the tablet in speak up mode until the pen goes
out of range. When an out-of-range packet arrives, the tablet is put into
shut up mode. When the pen goes back in range, the tablet is put back into
speak up mode. It is very important to follow this example in all pen
drivers. The state transition from in range to out of range is critical and
nothing will prove more annoying than quickly flicking a pen out of range
and causing the system to think the pen is still in contact with the
screen. The computer appears hung while the system patiently waits for the
user to finish writing and lift the pen.
<P>
<P><h3>Full-Screen MS-DOS Mode</h3>
 
<P>
If a machine has no keyboard and goes into a full-screen MS-DOS-based
application, there is no default way to get back into Windows except by
rebooting the machine. There are three options available to an OEM who
releases a keyboardless machine. An OEM can remove the .MOD files from the
Windows system directory, thereby disabling all MS-DOS sessions. An OEM can
use the modified Pen Windows .MOD files, which put up a warning dialog box
before launching any MS-DOS session. Or an OEM can write an MS-DOS mode pen
driver that supports some special gesture such as triple-tap, which
switches from an MS-DOS session back into Windows. This is a very OEM-
dependent situation that must be addressed in keyboardless machines, or
machines that often will be run without a keyboard.
<P>
<P><h3>286/386 MODE INTERRUPTS</h3>
 
<P>
The following sections contain discussions of the 286/386 protect mode
versus real mode issues and how they affect the design and behavior of pen
drivers.
<P>
<P><h3>System Layout</h3>
 
<P>
When Windows is running in standard mode, Windows owns the computer.
Windows can hook interrupts, execute IN and OUT instructions, and in
general exert complete control over the system. When it switches to a full
screen MS-DOS session, the MS-DOS session owns the computer.
<P>
When Windows is running in enhanced mode, what we normally think of as
Windows is really a virtual machine running in a much larger Windows
enhanced operating environment. All MS-DOS sessions are also running in
their own virtual machines in the Windows enhanced operating environment.
Every time a virtual machine (running in processor ring 3) executes a
privileged instruction (such as an IN, OUT, or INT), a privileged exception
occurs. The underlying Windows operating environment (running in ring 0)
takes over, checks permissions, and (if everything is OK) simulates the
instruction for the virtual machine. This exception-check-and-simulate
operation takes on the order of 100-300 CPU cycles. Clearly this is a very
expensive operation and to be avoided if possible.
<P>
If a hardware interrupt arrives in enhanced mode Windows and no virtual
driver in ring 0 has hooked the interrupt, the virtual PIC driver (VPICD)
in the Windows operating environment simulates a hardware interrupt
occurring in the virtual machine that has the focus. This also involves
ring transitions and is a very expensive process.
<P>
<P><h3>Protect Mode Interrupts</h3>
 
<P>
If standard mode Windows is running in protected mode (which it usually
is), then any interrupt that arrives is sent to whoever last hooked the
interrupt in standard mode. Standard mode interrupts are hooked via INT
21H, function 25H.
<P>
<P><h3>Real Mode Interrupts</h3>
 
<P>
If standard mode Windows is running in real mode (which happens when memory
is being moved around, when the disk is accessed, and other times), then
any interrupt that arrives is sent to whoever last hooked the interrupt in
real mode. If nobody has hooked the interrupt, Windows will "reflect" the
interrupt into standard mode and call any standard mode hook that exists.
The resources consumed by the reflection process are scarce and are easy to
destroy with high-speed interrupt devices such as pens. Thus it is
necessary to hook interrupts in real mode. Real mode interrupts are hooked
via INT 31H, function 0201H.
<P>
Once an interrupt arrives in real mode, there is very little processing
that can be done. Code and data are stored in real mode segments, not
protected mode selectors, so the DS and CS registers must hold the real
mode equivalent of their protected mode values. Any time a real mode
interrupt requires a significant amount of processing (such as making a far
call to another procedure), the interrupt handler should switch the
processor into protected mode via a real mode callback address, allocated
via DPMI's function 0303h.
<P>
DPMI is documented in the MS-DOS Protected Mode Interface Specification,
available from Intel by calling (800) 548-4725.
<P>
Pen drivers need a real mode interrupt handler because they process lots of
interrupts. Pen Drivers also need to switch to protected mode occasionally
in order to make far calls to PENWIN.DLL's AddPenEvent and ProcessPenEvent
routines.
<P>
<P><h3>Enhanced Mode Interrupts</h3>
 
<P>
When Windows is running in enhanced mode, interrupts force the processor to
switch to ring 0. If there is no virtual driver to take care of an
interrupt, the VPICD (virtual PIC driver) will reflect the interrupt into
whatever virtual machine has the focus. This reflection process is slow and
not very reliable with high interrupt rate devices such as pens, so it is
necessary to write a virtual pen driver that runs in ring 0, processes pen
interrupts, and performs ring transitions only when necessary.
<P>
In a pen driver, transitions from the ring 0 interrupt handler to ring 3
are necessary only when a complete pen packet has been built by handling
interrupts from the digitizer. Whether it is one or many interrupts per pen
packet, it is more efficient to handle them in a virtual pen driver than to
rely on the reflection process. Once the pen packet is complete, the
standard mode pen driver can be notified (see below for more information).
<P>
<P><h3>VIRTUAL DRIVERS</h3>
 
<P>
This section is a supplement to the "Virtual Device Adaptation Guide,"
found in the Windows versions 3.0 and 3.1 DDKs, not a substitute. A virtual
driver developer should first read Chapters 16 and 17 of the "Virtual
Device Adaptation Guide" and be familiar with the other chapters.
<P>
<P><h3>The Virtual Driver Environment</h3>
 
<P>
Virtual drivers are device drivers for the Windows operating environment
present when Windows is running in enhanced mode. They operate in a 32-bit
flat address space, and can utilize all 32 bits of the 386's registers.
Because they reside in ring 0, they can execute privileged instructions
such as IN, OUT, and INT without taking the massive performance hit that a
program running in ring 3 would take. Virtual drivers process interrupts
"below" all of the virtual machines (VMs) running in the Windows operating
environment. This means that a Windows virtual driver will "see" an
interrupt before either a Windows driver or MS-DOS device driver.
<P>
<P><h3>Focus</h3>
 
<P>
In the Windows operating environment, one virtual machine always has the
focus. All input and output go to this virtual machine. If an MS-DOS-based
application is active in a full screen session, then that virtual machine
has the focus. If a Windows-based application is currently active, then the
Windows VM (also known as the system VM) has the focus. If an MS-DOS full-
screen application has the focus, it is best not to capture and process
interrupts from the pen in the pen virtual device driver. Rather,
interrupts should be reflected to the VM that has the focus with the
VPICD_Set_Int_Request call. In this way, any MS-DOS device drivers running
in the VM can hook and process interrupts as if it owned all of the
hardware. For example, this would allow the creation of an MS-DOS pen
device driver that emulates a mouse.
<P>
<P><h3>How Ring 3 Code Calls Ring 0 Code</h3>
 
<P>
A program in ring 3, such as a Windows-based application or Windows device
driver, communicates with a virtual driver via the virtual driver's API
procedure. Every virtual device driver exports a single API for the sole
purpose of communication with the "outside world." The entry point for a
virtual device driver can be obtained by the INT 2FH, function 1684H. (This
is documented in Appendix D of the "Virtual Device Adaptation Guide," which
is part of the Windows 3.0/3.1 DDK.)
<P>
Once the address of a virtual driver's API procedure is known, a program
running in ring 3 can fill up its registers with useful information and
call the API procedure. The virtual driver's API procedure then takes over
and can read the virtual machine's registers. If the API procedure needs to
return a value, it can modify the caller's registers as necessary.
<P>
A standard mode pen driver running in ring 3 may want to call a virtual pen
driver running in ring 0 when it wants to give the virtual driver useful
information, such as the address of the PENINFO structure. This is the case
in the sample serial pen driver shipped in the DDK, which at initialization
time must give the virtual pen driver the address of a buffer that can
serve to contain an entire pen packet. Once the virtual pen driver knows
the address of this packet, it can "fill it in" at interrupt time as input
is received from the digitizing device.
<P>
<P><h3>How Ring 0 Code Calls Ring 3 Code</h3>
 
<P>
It is not very easy for a ring 0 virtual driver to communicate with a ring
3 program. The virtual machine running in ring 3 may think it has
interrupts turned off, so calling or jumping to an entry point in the ring
3 virtual machine is bound to corrupt it. The only proper technique is for
the ring 0 program to wait until the ring 3 virtual machine is accepting
interrupts, and then simulate an interrupt in the ring 3 virtual machine.
<P>
Windows provides a mechanism, Call_Priority_VM_Event, whereby a ring 0
program can schedule an event procedure that will get executed when a
specified virtual machine turns interrupt processing back on.
Call_Priority_VM_Event is documented in Chapter 25 of the "Virtual Device
Adaptation Guide." The event procedure can simulate an interrupt in the
ring 3 virtual machine via the Build_Int_Stack_Frame and Resume_Exec calls,
documented in Chapters 21 and 22 of the "Virtual Device Adaptation Guide."
After the call to Resume_Exec, the ring 3 virtual machine takes control of
the system and performs any work that needs to be done. When it is
finished, it executes an IRET instruction, which returns control back to
the ring 0 virtual driver.
<P>
A virtual pen driver may want to call a standard mode pen driver when it
has constructed a pen packet from the hardware and wants to submit the pen
packet for processing by Windows for Pen Computing. The sample serial
driver in the Windows for Pen Computing DDK utilizes this mechanism to
inform the standard mode driver that a pen packet has been completed. As
discussed above, the virtual pen driver is processing interrupts from the
digitizing device at ring 0 and building a pen packet in a memory location
provided by the standard mode pen driver at initialization time. Once the
pen packet is complete, the virtual pen driver simply schedules a ring 3
interrupt to occur. In response to the ring 3 interrupt, the standard mode
pen driver calls AddPenEvent and ProcessPenEvent.
<P>
<P><h3>Hooking Interrupts</h3>
 
<P>
A virtual pen driver can hook an IRQ at initialization time via the
VPICD_Virtualize_IRQ call. Among other things, this call specifies what
procedure should get executed when a hardware interrupt arrives on the
specified IRQ line. This is the method by which a virtual pen driver can
associate a tablet interrupt with a procedure in its code space. For
example, the serial driver in the Windows for Pen Computing DDK utilizes
this method to hook either IRQ 3 or 4 (depending on whether the tablet is
connected to COM1 or COM2) so that it can receive input from the pen.
<P>
<P><h3>Handling Interrupts</h3>
 
<P>
There is nothing special about handling interrupts in a ring 0 virtual
driver. The interrupt handling code can still execute the IN instruction to
get data from a port, it must be sure and send an EOI when it is done
processing, and it should return from the interrupt procedure with a RET
instruction.
<P>
<P><h3>INI File Parameters</h3>
 
<P>
Pen drivers should use the [Pen Driver] section of the SYSTEM.INI file to
store any initialization information. There are only four keys all pen
drivers must support, and they are described below. Any OEM may also use
and support OEM-specific keys and values.
<P>
<PRE>   wOffsetX, wOffsetY

   These values specify the quantity plus 1000 in tablet hardware units
   that must be added to every pen packet. They are used by tablet drivers
   to calibrate a digitizer for horizontal and vertical drift, or simply
   offset from origin variances in manufacture of the digitizer/display
   combination. These values have 1000 added to them because reading and
   writing negative values to the SYSTEM.INI file is difficult.

   wDistinctWidth, wDistinctHeight

   These values, if they exist, override the default wDistinctWitdth and
   wDistinctHeight values in the PENINFO structure, thereby setting a new
   upper bound on the width and height of the tablet in tablet hardware
   units.

</PRE><h3>How to Quickly Get a Driver Up and Running</h3>
 
<P>
If you are in a hurry to get a pen driver up and running on new hardware,
it is best to copy the source of a pen driver for similar hardware and
modify it for the new hardware's parameters. The following is a list of
files in the standard mode pen driver and the areas that usually need to be
changed:
<P>
<PRE>   File            Changes
   ----            -------

   DISABLE.ASM     Make sure the correct PIC (either the master or
                   the slave) is disabled.

   ENABLE.ASM      Make sure the correct PIC (either the master or
                   the slave) is enabled. The setup_tablet
                   function is very hardware-dependent. Perform
                   any hardware-dependent resetting of the tablet
                   in that procedure.

   FILTER.ASM      This is another hardware-dependent file. Some
                   tablets don't need any filtering; some need a
                   lot; some only need to filter the PDK bits in
                   the PENPACKET structure; some only need to
                   filter X and Y data in the PENPACKET structure.

   HARDWARE.INC    All of the parameters here are extremely
                   hardware-dependent. Be sure the Raw
                   measurements measure the size of the tablet in
                   1000ths of an inch, and the Distinct
                   measurements measure the maximum values
                   returned by the hardware (that is, the maximum X,Y
                   resolution--often just digitizer extents--
                   returned by the digitizing hardware).

   LOAD.ASM        Any OEM-specific INI file switches should be
                   read here. This is also where hardware
                   communications variables and interrupt
                   variables are usually initialized.

   MISC.ASM        Most of the routines in here are hardware-
                   dependent handlers for the various installable
                   pen driver messages, and must be customized by
                   the OEM.

   INT.ASM         Obviously the interrupt handler is very
                   hardware-dependent. But it is surprising how
                   little of the code actually needs to change
                   from driver to driver. The code that often
                   needs the most work is the byte reader and
                   PENPACKET constructor (from the int_286 label
                   to the IRET instruction), the EOI code (make
                   sure it is sent to the correct PICs!), and the
                   SpeakUp and ShutUp code. The rest of the code
                   (such as DealWithPenPacket) is hardware-
                   independent and can usually be left alone.

</PRE>The standard mode driver should be tested and debugged in standard mode
Windows, and be efficient and error free before a virtual pen driver is
developed for enhanced mode Windows. The following are the areas that
usually need to be changed in the source to a virtual driver:
<P>
<PRE>   File            Changes
   ----            -------

   VPEND.ASM       The IRQ virtualized in the call to
                   VPICD_Virtualize_IRQ is hardware dependent.

   HWINT.ASM       Usually, only the byte reader and PENPACKET
                   constructor (from the start of the procedure to
                   VHI_send_pen_packet) needs to be changed.

</PRE><h3>COMMON PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS</h3>
 
<P>
Problems that are likely to be encountered during pen driver development,
along with solutions to those problems, are presented in the following
section.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows Boots But There Is No Cursor</h3>
 
<P>
If Windows boots but there is no cursor on the screen, then the Windows
mouse driver (that's mouse, not pen) cannot find any mouse hardware and is
returning failure when it is loaded. A special mouse driver, YESMOUSE.DRV,
is distributed with Windows for Pen Computing, which always returns success
even when there is no mouse hardware present. If the mouse.drv= line in the
[boot] section of the WIN.INI file points to YESMOUSE.DRV, then a cursor
will be drawn by Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>The Cursor Doesn't Move When the Pen Moves</h3>
 
<P>
When this happens, it is helpful to launch debug Windows with the kernel
debugger and use breakpoints to determine what parts of the pen driver are
not executing. Complete documentation on debug Windows and the kernel
debugger can be found in the Microsoft Windows version 3.1 SDK and DDK
documentation. Additionally, there are some very helpful WDEB386 articles
available to Microsoft OnLine subscribers.
<P>
When the pen doesn't work at all, put a breakpoint in the load, enable, and
interrupt processing procedures. If Load is not getting called, verify that
the SYSTEM.INI file is pointing to the correct driver. If Enable is not
getting called, make sure the Load routine is returning a 1. If the
hardware interrupt routine is not getting called, make sure the Enable
routine hooked all the interrupts and manipulated all of the appropriate
I/O ports correctly. If the hardware routine is only called once, make sure
an EOI is sent to the correct PIC after every interrupt. If the hardware
routine is getting called all the time but the pen still doesn't move,
verify the AddPenEvent routine in PENWIN.DLL is getting called with a
properly formed PENPACKET, and that ProcessPenEvent is getting called after
AddPenEvent.
<P>
<P><h3>The Cursor Isn't Lined Up with the Pen</h3>
 
<P>
If the pen has a parallax (offset) problem, there is an application in the
control panel that can calibrate pen drivers. The application really just
sends the DRV_ messages to perform the calibration discussed above--and
writes out values to SYSTEM.INI to be used by the pen driver the next time
the system is started. If the cursor is consistently off by the same amount
on each tablet, the Distinct and Offset values in HARDWARE.INC probably
need adjusting.
<P>
If the Calibration application doesn't fix these problems, if the digitizer
surface has "holes" in it, or if the tablet has areas where the pen seems
to be more out of calibration than usual, this indicates a hardware
problem. Either a custom calibration application and pen driver need to be
built in order to take the digitizer quirks into account, or the hardware
needs to be replaced.
<P>
NOTE: The source code for the Calibrate application is available in the
Windows for Pen Computing OAK.
<P>
<P><h3>The Cursor Falls Way Behind in Following the Pen</h3>
 
<P>
This usually indicates a performance problem in the pen driver or in the
hardware. The debug version of Windows is slow and may cause such a
performance problem. Also, enhanced mode Windows is slower than standard
mode Windows. Try running the retail version of Windows in standard mode as
a performance benchmark. If this does not rectify the problem, using a
slower pen sampling rate probably will. Note that a minimum of 100 samples
per second is required for adequate handwriting recognition. If this rate
cannot be maintained, then the hardware may simply be too slow. The virtual
pen driver has a queue of 32 pen packets, and sometimes a delay of 32 pen
packets is noticeable. This queue may have to be disabled on slower
hardware.
<P>
<P><h3>The Cursor Flickers or Jumps</h3>
 
<P>
This indicates either a performance problem or a hardware problem. If the
tablet digitizer is resistive, this usually indicates a hardware problem.
<P>
If the tablet hardware can sense proximity, this usually indicates a
software performance problem. Possible solutions to the performance problem
are slowing down the sampling rate, writing better pen-packet filtering
code, and if the problem only appears in enhanced mode Windows, making sure
the virtual pen driver is installed correctly and is processing interrupts.
<P>
<P><h3>The Cursor Moves and Tracks the Pen, But Recognition Is Poor</h3>
 
<P>
Usually this means the tablet measurements in the PENINFO structure are too
small. Double check that the raw width and height measurements are in fact
the size of the tablet in thousandths of an inch. For example, if the
tablet surface is 8 inches wide, then PENINFO.cxRawWidth must be 8000. If
the recognizer does not know the accurate size of the tablet, recognition
quality will suffer.
