<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After an implicitly loaded dynamic-link library (DLL) attempts to create a
window in its initialization procedure, a Fatal Exit 0x0019 occurs.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When an application is loaded, Windows loads any DLLs that are implicitly
referenced by that application prior to initializing the application's
task. Part of task initialization is creating a message queue for that
application. By the time the application's WinMain() function is called,
the message queue has been created.
<P>
Any window created by a DLL uses the message queue of the application task
using that DLL. If an implicitly loaded DLL creates a window in its
initialization code (that is, LibMain) there is no message queue for it to
use. When Windows detects this situation, it signals Fatal Exit 0x0019.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If the DLL must display a message during initialization, it must either be
explicitly loaded from the application using LoadLibrary() or the DLL
should export a function that can be called from the WinMain() procedure of
the application. By the time WinMain() is executed, the window queue has
been created.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Windows, a network driver is the only DLL that can create a
window during initialization. The network driver is loaded after the first
application task has been initialized (that is, the shell), and any dialog
box displayed by a network driver uses the message queue of the shell
application.
