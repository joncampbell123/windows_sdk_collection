The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.0 and 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
The following modes used when opening a file with OpenFile() have an effect
only if SHARE is loaded:
<P>
OF_SHARE_COMPAT (same as specifying no sharing flags, thus its name):
If the file has not been opened in any other sharing mode, the current
task may open the same file in OF_SHARE_COMPAT mode any number of
times. If the current task attempts to open the file in any other
sharing mode, the open will fail. If other tasks attempt to open the
file with any sharing mode, the open will fail. If the file has the
read-only file attribute, other tasks may open the file in
OF_SHARE_COMPAT mode any number of times.
<P>
OF_SHARE_DENY_WRITE: If the file has not been opened in any other
sharing mode, any task may open the file any number of times in
OF_SHARE_DENY WRITE. Attempting to open the file in any other sharing
modes will fail.
<P>
OF_SHARE_DENY_READ: If the file has not been opened in any other
sharing mode, any task may open the file any number of times in
OF_SHARE_DENY_READ. Attempting to open the file in any other sharing
modes will fail.
<P>
OF_SHARE_EXCLUSIVE: If the file has not been opened in any other
sharing mode, the file will be opened. Any additional attempts to open
the file in any sharing modes by any task will fail.
<P>
OF_SHARE_DENY_NONE: If the file has not been opened in any other
sharing mode, any task may open the file any number of times in
OF_SHARE_DENY_NONE. Attempting to open the file in any other sharing
modes will fail.
