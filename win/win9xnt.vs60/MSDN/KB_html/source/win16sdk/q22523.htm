The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.0 and 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
In no sense can Microsoft Windows be considered a "real-time" system.
It is a message-driven, event-polling system, with nonpreemptive
scheduling. The following is additional information:

<OL><P><LI>It is possible to write a Windows-based application that sits on some
   interrupt in order to watch board-level activity. In general, this
   facility is used by manufacturers of boards to write drivers that
   watch and respond to interrupts used by the board. It is extremely
   dangerous to allocate/sit on any interrupt used by Windows itself
   (keyboard, mouse, etc.).

<P><LI>Dedicated systems (those that will not run general-purpose Windows
   applications) may sit on the timer interrupt, as long as Windows
   is eventually notified of the timer ticks. Because of the
   nonpreemptive aspect of the Windows system, it is insensitive to
   delays in the arrival of timer ticks. Trying to run more than one
   time-critical application that sits on the timer interrupt is
   likely to fail.

<P><LI>You must arrange for a Windows "library" of routines to provide
   access to information available from a board. The issue is one of
   how to divide the work between the following portions:
<P>
   a. The driver portion, which watches the interrupt, logs data, and
<P><PRE>      notifies clients [through PostMessage()] of the availability of
      data
</PRE><P>
   b. The client portion, which obtains data from the driver portion,
<P><PRE>      and processes, displays, and stores data
</PRE><P>
   Drivers can be implemented as Windows libraries, and clients of the
   device can be implemented as Windows-based applications. The driver
   portion can be made NEAR real time; the application portion is
   going to be message driven.
