The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) version
3.1, Windows may appear to hang if the following three items are true:

<OL><P><LI>You are using the DBWIN sample application (DBWIN.EXE--see pages 245-
   247 of the Windows SDK "Programming Tools" manual) to catch the
   output of the debug kernel.

<P><LI>There is no other output device, other than DBWIN.

<P><LI>The "Break on Warnings" option is set in DBWIN.
<P>
</OL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Upon entry to Windows, warnings may be displayed by the debug kernel. If
the Break on Warnings option is set as an option in the DBWIN sample
application and the Save Debug Settings is chosen from the File menu,
DBWIN will save the option in the DebugOptions setting of the WIN.INI
file under the [WINDOWS] header. Windows reads the WIN.INI file on
startup and sees that bit number 12 of the DebugOptions field under the
[WINDOWS] heading has been set (0x1000).
<P>
If bit number 12 has been set and warnings are generated before the
DBWIN application is started, the debug kernel will generate fatal exit
warnings. Because there is no output screen defined (because DBWIN is
not running yet and there is no alternate output screen), the system
will appear to be hung, when in reality it is waiting for input.
However, because DBWIN has not defined where the input will come from,
the only solution is to reboot and change the WIN.INI (or SYSTEM.INI)
settings before entering Windows (See RESOLUTION for details).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around the problem, do one of the following:

<OL><P><LI>Change the DebugOptions setting in the WIN.INI file under the
   [WINDOWS] heading. The value listed will be a four-digit hexadecimal
   number. The first digit must be changed to an even number to ensure
   that bit number 12 is not set (for example, 0x3000 should be changed
   to 0x2000). This method will cause the Break on Warnings option in
   DBWIN to be unchecked.

<P><LI>Add the following section to the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [debug]
      OutputTo=NUL
</PRE><P>
   A filename could replace NUL in the above statement if desired.
<P>
</OL>Once one of these procedures has been done, enter Windows and it will
come up normally.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To reproduce the problem, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Ensure that you are running the debug kernel (run N2D.BAT from the MS-
   DOS prompt before entering Windows).

<P><LI>Run the DBWIN sample application.

<P><LI>Choose Settings from the Options menu.

<P><LI>Ensure that the Break on Warnings check box is checked.

<P><LI>Choose OK.

<P><LI>Choose Save Debug Settings from the File menu.
<P>
</OL>To determine whether the change was successfully made, edit the WIN.INI
file and view the DebugOptions setting under the [WINDOWS] heading. Bit
number 12 should be set (the first digit will be an odd number).
