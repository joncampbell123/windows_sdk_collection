<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information concerns the Microsoft Windows for Pen
Computing sample Training Emulator, version 1 (TrainInk).
<P>
There is a sample called TRAINEM in the Microsoft Software Library.
This Windows for Pen Computing sample demonstrates how to do simple
training on a trainable handwriting recognizer. The sample utilizes
the TrainInk application programming interface (API) to do the
training.
<P>
Download TRAINEM.EXE from the Microsoft Software Library (MSL) on the
following services:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Download Service (MSDL)
<P><PRE>      Dial (206) 936-6735 to connect to MSDL
      Download <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/trainem.exe">TRAINEM.EXE</A> <I>(size: 24845 bytes)</I>

</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
TRAINEM is a Windows for Pen Computing version 1.0 sample, which can
be run on any Windows version 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups machine
that has the Pen Extensions installed [from the Microsoft Windows 3.1
Software Development Kit (SDK) or Visual C++ Development Kit.]
<P>
On a system that is running only the Pen Extensions and not the full
Windows for Pen Computing environment, the virtual keyboard executable
may not be present (SKB.EXE on U.S. systems) such that the
ShowKeyboard call cannot bring up the virtual keyboard. In this case,
when the Keyboard button is pressed, a dialog box will be displayed
informing the user that the virtual keyboard could not be started.
<P>
TRAINEM demonstrates one of the training APIs used in training
handwriting in a recognizer. The TrainInk API is the simpler of the
two training APIs available; however, using it requires knowledge of
recognizers and what they are capable of doing. Therefore, TRAINEM
also demonstrates querying a recognizer to determine whether it is
capable of being trained; if so, the sample demonstrates the
limitations of that training.
<P>
TRAINEM also demonstrates one method of capturing ink for training,
and displays an interface that a user can use to view that ink and
train it to the correct value. Note that during this process, ink can
be captured and saved from an hedit or bedit control, and textual
information can be retrieved with ordinary window messages.
<P>
As written, TRAINEM requires the Microsoft default recognizer, also
known as the Roman recognizer, MARS. Note that the ConfigRecognizer
call is resident in the recognizer code itself and must be imported
explicitly in the .DEF file. In the more general case, not dealt with
in this sample, an application could install the recognizer at run
time or query for the current recognizer and obtain a pointer to the
needed function. This sample uses the more direct and easier method,
though not necessarily the most robust method.
<P>
The sample also requires that some action be taken after a recognition
session has taken place in the main hedit control on the main window.
The user must choose either the Reset Hedit button or the Train button
before further recognition sessions are allowed in the control. The
control is disabled until training has taken place or until the
control is reset.
<P>
This method was used to avoid losing track of the correct ink to train
in the hedit control. More sophisticated training programs might
explore algorithms that allow for tracking multiple recognition
sessions, and bring up the appropriate result and original ink on
request for training. This sample is a simple demonstration of the
basics required for training a recognizer; more sophisticated
algorithms for handling multiple recognition sessions are beyond its
scope.
