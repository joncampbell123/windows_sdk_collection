<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.0 and 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
Opening a file in compatibility mode is a very unfriendly action in a
multitasking environment such as Windows. There is never any need to
do so; compatibility mode provides support for old MS-DOS
(non-Windows) applications however it does not provide additional
functionality.
<P>
Use the following four guidelines for opening files:

<OL><P><LI>Do not use the _lcreate function, it opens files in compatibility
   mode. If it is necessary to create a file, immediately close the
   file and then reopen it with the _lopen function.

<P><LI>Do not use the OF_SHARE_COMPAT option with the _lopen or OpenFile
   functions. Instead, use one of the other OF_SHARE defines. If no
   OF_SHARE value is specified, the file is opened in compatibility
   mode.

<P><LI>When creating a file using MS-DOS interrupts 3Ch or 5Bh, after
   creating the file, close it and then open it again. The create
   leaves it in compatibility mode.

<P><LI>When opening a file (MS-DOS interrupts 3Dh or 6Ch), make sure that
   the file is NOT opened in compatibility mode.
<P>
</OL>When specifying the open mode and share, do not request more access
than required. If a file will only be read, open it in read-only mode
EVEN IF EXCLUSIVE ACCESS IS REQUESTED. Do not lock out other access
unnecessarily. If an application will only read a file, allow other
applications to read the file as well.
<P>
Finally, be open to alternatives when opening a file. If a file is
being opened to display its contents and an open READ-ONLY, DENY-WRITE
fails, try an open READ-ONLY, DENY-NONE.
