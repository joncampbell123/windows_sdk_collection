<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>WinLUA Overview</h3>
 
<P>
WinLUA defines a standard and consistent API for the 16 and 32-bit
versions of the Microsoft Windows graphical environment. It encompasses a
set of Windows-specific asyncronous notification methods designed to allow
the programmer to take advantage of the message-driven nature of the
Windows graphical environment.
<P>
This API has been designed and specified to provide a standard to which
application developers can program and network software vendors can
conform. These API details constitute documentation for application
software developers and a specification for network software vendors.
<P>
Network software that conforms to either the WinLUA RUI or WinLUA SLI
specification will be considered "WinLUA compliant."  To be WinLUA
compliant, a vendor must implement 100 percent of the WinLUA RUI or WinLUA
SLI specification. Suppliers of such interfaces shall be referred to as
"WinLUA suppliers."
<P>
Applications that are capable of exploiting any WinLUA implementation will
be considered as having a "WinLUA interface" and will be referred to as
"WinLUA applications."
<P>
While WinLUA is one of the WinSNA APIs to be standardized for the Windows
environment; it is beyond the scope of this document to deal with other SNA
(Systems Network Architecture) APIs.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Windows Graphical Environment and Windows-Specific Extensions</h3>
 
<P>
This API has been designed for ALL implementations and versions of the
Windows environment from and including version 3.0. It thus provides for
WinLUA implementations and WinLUA applications in both 16 and 32-bit
operating environments.
<P>
WinLUA makes provisions for multithreaded Windows-based processes. A
process contains one or more threads of execution. In the Win16 non-
multithreaded world, a task corresponds to a process with a single thread.
All references to threads in this document refer to actual "threads" in
multithreaded Windows environments. In non-multithreaded environments (such
as version 3.0), use of the term thread refers to a Windows process.
<P>
The extensions to the Windows environment included in WinLUA are provided
for maximum programming compatibility and optimum application performance.
<P>
WINLUA can be found in the Software/Data Library by searching on the word
WINLUA, the Q number of this article, or S13713. WINLUA was archived using
the PKware file-compression utility.
