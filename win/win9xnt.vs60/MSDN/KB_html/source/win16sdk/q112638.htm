The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Every Windows dynamic-link library (DLL) should include a termination
function called as a Windows Exit Procedure (WEP) to perform general
purpose cleanup operations when Windows unloads a DLL from memory. Under
Windows version 3.0, WEPs are not implemented properly; however, under
Windows version 3.1, the design of WEPs is enhanced to perform cleanup
operations. Also, Microsoft C/C++ versions 7.0 and later provide a default
WEP for DLLs in the standard C run-time libraries. This article discusses
some issues that relate to WEPs in the various Windows environments.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
As mentioned earlier, every Windows DLL typically includes a Windows Exit
Procedure (WEP), which should be the last function called in the last
reference to a DLL before the DLL is removed from memory.
<P>
<P><h3>WEPs under Windows Version 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
WEPs were introduced in Windows version 3.0 to allow each DLL that hooked
interrupts and/or modified I/O ports to clean up when the DLL was unloaded.
However, because the initial implementation is flawed and the limitations
not well documented, the use of WEPs in Windows version 3.0 is very much
limited.
<P>
<P><h3>WEPs Under Windows Version 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
Here are some general rules in building WEPs:

<UL><LI>All DLLs must have a WEP. Even if the WEP does not do anything, the WEP
   must still be defined. An exception to this rule is when you are using
   any of the C/C++ compilers from Microsoft. This exception is discussed
   in a later section of this article.

<LI>A WEP must be declared as a FAR PASCAL function.

<LI>A WEP must be exported by listing it in the EXPORTS section of the DLL's
   DEF file. The RESIDENTNAME keyword and any ordinal reference must be
   associated with it (so that Windows can find the WEP routine, even when
   there is little available memory, without loading anything from disk).
   For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      EXPORTS
<PRE></PRE>        WEP     @1     RESIDENTNAME

   NOTE: It is not necessary to use 1 as the ordinal reference; any number
   can be used.

</PRE></UL><h3>Changes to WEPs Under Windows Version 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
Several changes were made to the implementation of WEPs under Windows
version 3.1. The following comprehensive list of changes compares the
implementation in Windows 3.0 to that in Windows 3.1:

<UL><LI>In Windows version 3.0, the WEP is called on a very small stack located
   in the Windows Kernel module, which will overflow if the WEP function
   calls Windows APIs and MS-DOS functions. The reason for this is that the
   WEP was originally designed to allow a DLL that hooked an interrupt to
   unhook it before termination, and not as a general purpose cleanup
   routine. The small Kernel stack was enough to unhook an interrupt,
   however.
<P>
   In Windows version 3.1, the WEP is called on a 4K stack in Kernel, which
   provides enough room to call Windows APIs and MS-DOS functions, and
   perform any cleanup operation.

<LI>In Windows version 3.0, if a DLL uses another DLL (which is implicitly
   referenced), the DLL's WEP function can be called after the associated
   DLL is freed. If the segment that contains the WEP is discarded while
   containing references to the associated DLL, the system crashes when the
   WEP's segment is reloaded. This happens when Windows attempts to fix up
   the external references to the already freed DLL. The fix for this
   problem was to keep the WEP routine in a FIXED segment.
<P>
   In Windows version 3.1, all affected WEPs are called before any DLLs are
   freed or discarded. Thus, WEPs can reside in discardable segments in
   DLLs written explicitly for Windows version 3.1.

<LI>For the same reason mentioned above, in Windows version 3.1, a WEP can
   also call functions in other DLLs. The caveat here is that a DLL must
   not rely on library unload order on its own implicitly link DLLs. The
   Windows loader may have unloaded your DLL making the function call
   result in a general protection (GP) fault. The safe functions to call
   are any that reside in the core libraries such as USER, KERNEL, and GDI.

<LI>In Windows version 3.0, under some low memory situations, the WEP can be
   called before the library initialization routine has been called.
<P>
   In Windows version 3.1, Windows calls a WEP only if the library entry
   point function has been called. The WEP code, for DLLs written
   specifically for Windows version 3.1, no longer needs to track this
   itself.

<LI>In Windows version 3.0, under some low memory situations, the WEP can be
   called before the library's DGROUP has been created.
<P>
   Windows version 3.1 ensures that the automatic data segment is allocated
   before the WEP is called. The WEP code can assume that DS is valid and
   that it contains the selector to the DLL's data segment.

<LI>Under rare circumstances, the WEP for a DLL can be called more than once
   in Windows version 3.0. In Windows version 3.1, the WEP is never called
   more than once.

<LI>In Windows version 3.0, the USER module is notified that a DLL is freed
   before the WEP is called. Thus, any resources, such as registered
   classes, are freed by the USER module before the WEP is called. In
   Windows 3.1, USER is notified after the WEP is called.

<LI>Because the Microsoft Windows version 3.0 SDK documentation is unclear
   concerning the return value from a WEP, the WEP code in some existing
   DLLs does not do a RETF 2. Windows version 3.1 saves and restores the
   value of SP around the call to the WEP.
<P>
</UL><h3>WEPs Under Microsoft C/C++ Versions 7.0 and Later</h3>
 
<P>
As mentioned earlier, beginning with Microsoft C/C++, the standard C run-
time libraries that support DLLs for Windows (xDLLCyW.LIB) contain a
default Windows exit procedure WEP(), a default entry-point procedure
LibEntry() in the LIBENTRY.OBJ file, and a default library initialization
procedure LibMain(). Therefore, if you link to one of the C run-time
libraries provided with Microsoft C/C++ versions 7.0 and later, you no
longer need to provide your own WEP() or LibMain() routine or link to a
LIBENTRY.OBJ file.
<P>
The LibEntry() procedure in the DLL C run-time libraries performs all the
necessary initialization required by the WEPs they contain. The LibEntry()
procedure in the default LIBENTRY.OBJ file will call a default LibMain()
procedure. The default LibMain() procedure returns and does nothing useful.
Remember that no initialization will be done if you use the default
LibMain(). However, your DLL could define its own LibMain() function so as
to perform any type of additional initialization processing that it needs
(for example, registering custom control classes or allocate global memory,
and so forth). In such a case, the LibMain() in your DLL will be called
instead of the default LibMain() in the run-time library.
<P>
To use the default run-time library's LibEntry() procedure, just do not
link to a LIBENTRY.OBJ file. To use the default run-time library's
LibMain() function, do not provide a LibMain() function in your DLL.
<P>
Similarly, the C run-time libraries call a default version of the WEP
function at the time a DLL needs to be unloaded from memory. The source
code for the default WEP routine is included in a file called WEP.ASM in
the SOURCE\STARTUP\WIN directory of Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0 or later.
This default WEP routine just returns and does nothing useful [other than
performing some C exit processing by calling _cexit()].
<P>
To use the default run-time library's WEP routine, just include the
following lines in the .DEF file:
<P>
<PRE>   SEGMENTS 'WEP_TEXT' FIXED PRELOAD
   EXPORTS
       WEP @1 RESIDENTNAME

</PRE>Because the WEP's code is very small, making the WEP_TEXT segment fixed in
memory should not adversely impact Windows's performance.
<P>
However, in certain cases there is a need to link into your own WEP routine
instead of the default WEP routine provided by the Microsoft C/C++
compiler. This is possible, because the default WEP calls an optional user
termination function _WEP. Therefore, to add your own processing to the
default WEP function, add a _WEP function as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   int FAR PASCAL _WEP (int ExitCode)
   {
     //
     // Include exit cleanup code here
     //
     return ExitCode;
   }

</PRE>NOTE: Unlike the default WEP routine, the name of your routine must begin
with a leading underscore. If a _WEP routine is not provided in a DLL, the
default WEP routine will call the default _WEP routine, which simply
returns a 1. In the case where you define your own _WEP routine, LINK.EXE
will resolve references to _WEP to your _WEP instead of the default _WEP
that exists in the DLL C run-time library (as long as you put the object
file that contains your _WEP to the left of the DLL run-time library in the
LINK command line).
<P>
NOTE: The default WEP routine provided by the run-time libraries assumes
protected-mode operation only because it calls the LAR instruction in its
source code, which is a protected-mode instruction only, and therefore will
not work in real mode (for example, under Windows 3.0).
<P>
NOTE: The default WEP provided by the Microsoft C/C++ run-time libraries
calls a routine in WIN87EM.DLL, which is the Windows 80x87 floating-point
emulation library. Under certain situations, the WIN87EM library might have
been unloaded from memory by the time the default WEP routine is called. If
this causes problems, copying WIN87EM.DLL to WIN87EM.EXE and placing it on
the LOAD= line of WIN.INI will ensure the usage count of WIN87EM will never
reach zero.
<P>
NOTE: Avoid making recursive calls or calling MS-DOS functions or using
file I/O in the _WEP routine, if you provide one in the DLL.
<P>
NOTE: Because the initialization and termination operations performed by
the LibEntry and WEP functions in the C run-time libraries are correlated,
you should use them both, or neither. If you use your own WEP, then you
should link to LIBENTRY.OBJ; if you use the C run-time library's WEP, you
should use its LibEntry as well.
