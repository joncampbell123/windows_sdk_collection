<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information describes a procedure to smoothly drag the
window frame; this procedure is similar to the one that Windows uses
when a window is moved by dragging its caption bar. When the user
moves a window with the mouse or with the keyboard, Windows shows the
movement of the window by a moving a gray-patterned frame. The
dragging looks smooth because Windows updates only the portions of the
frame that need to be erased or drawn, leaving all other areas
untouched.
<P>
One technique to implement smooth dragging for a single rectangle is
described below. An actual frame in Windows consists of four thin
rectangles dragged together.
<P>
DRAGRECT is a file in the Microsoft Software Library that demonstrates
dragging a single rectangle and a frame.
<P>
Download DRAGRECT.EXE, a self-extracting file, from the Microsoft Software
Library (MSL) on the following services:

</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To smoothly drag a rectangle, redraw only the invalid portions of the
rectangle. For example, if a rectangle is dragged up by 3 pixels, only
the top 3 pixels need to be drawn and the bottom 3 pixels erased. All
other parts of the rectangle are left alone. The same principle
applies when a rectangle is moved on a diagonal--two edges are drawn,
two edges are erased, and the bulk of the middle of the rectangle
remains the same.
<P>
To implement smooth dragging of a single solid rectangle, perform the
following eight steps:

<OL><P><LI>When dragging begins, save the coordinates of the rectangle.

<P><LI>Draw the initial rectangle using a pattern brush and the PatBlt
   function. Windows uses its own gray brush made with a bitmap of
   alternating 0x55 and 0xAA values. In the PatBlt call, use the
   PATINVERT option to combine the pattern brush and the screen using
   the XOR operation. The XOR option is very convenient because
   another XOR operation restores the screen to its original state.
<P>
   Alternatively, use the DSTINVERT option, which performs a NOT
   operation on the destination rectangle, ignoring the current
   selected brush. A second NOT operation restores the screen to its
   original state. A NOT operation is slightly faster than an XOR
   operation; however, it is not nearly as flexible with respect to
   the nature of the rectangle drawn.

<P><LI>Each time the mouse is moved, save the new coordinates. The old
   coordinates must be retained for the time being.

<P><LI>Create an intersection rectangle of the old and new positions using
   the IntersectRect function. If this rectangle is empty, call the
   PatBlt function twice: to erase the old rectangle and to draw the
   new rectangle. This is allowed because the old and new positions
   have no overlapping region.

<P><LI>If the two rectangles intersect, update only the nonoverlapping
   regions--the edges of the old and new rectangles that are not in
   the intersection.

<P><LI>In most cases, the rectangle moves in both horizontal and vertical
   directions, which creates two regions that need updating:
<P>
<PRE>      XXXXXXXXXXXX    The union of X, x, and . is the original
      XXXXXXXXXXXX       rectangle.
      x...........o   The union of O, o, and . is the new rectangle.
      x...........o
      x...........o   Erase the areas marked with an X or x.
      x...........o   Draw the areas marked with an O or o.
      x...........o
       OOOOOOOOOOOO
       OOOOOOOOOOOO

</PRE><P><LI>Each update region contains two smaller rectangles: one that makes
   up the horizontal section along the top (marked with uppercase
   characters in the diagram above) and one that makes up the vertical
   section along the side (marked with lowercase characters).
<P>
   Once the application determines the coordinates of these
   rectangles, call the PatBlt function to draw or erase them as
   appropriate. Do not draw overlapping areas twice; that is, when
   dealing with areas marked x or o, do not draw in the areas marked X
   or O, or vice versa.
<P>
   At this point, the rectangle has been moved without affecting the
   intersecting region (marked with periods) at all. Because the
   intersection was not erased or drawn, no flicker occurs and the
   dragging appears smooth.

<P><LI>When dragging stops (the mouse button is released), call the PatBlt
   function to erase the current rectangle because it is no longer
   needed.
<P>
</OL>When a window is moved by dragging the caption bar, Windows divides
the window's rectangle into four parts: the bottom, top, left, and
right lines. Each line is a rectangle because the border of a window
is usually thicker than one pixel. The dragging process above is
applied to all of these rectangles at the same time.
<P>
The DRAGRECT sample program available in the Microsoft Software Library
demonstrates the dragging process for both a single rectangle and a
frame made of four separate rectangles. Note that the sample program
is not optimized to drag a frame with the same efficiency as Windows;
it is meant only to demonstrate the concepts involved.
