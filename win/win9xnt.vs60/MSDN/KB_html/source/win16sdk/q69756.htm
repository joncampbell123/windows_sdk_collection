The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.0 and 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
In the Microsoft Windows environment, an application should perform
only those operations specified by the Windows application programming
interface (API). Specifically, a Windows-based application should not:

<OL><P><LI>Use processor I/O instructions.

<P><LI>Issue software interrupts.

<P><LI>Install interrupt handlers.
<P>
</OL>These three operations should be done only in a Windows dynamic-link
library (DLL).
<P>
The Windows API has been designed to let programmers write applications in
a hardware-independent fashion. However, some programmers may have noticed
that the three operations mentioned previously can be performed from both
Windows DLLs and applications.
<P>
Therefore, it may be tempting to avoid coding these operations in a
DLL, especially if the DLL's only purpose is to execute functions that
seem to operate correctly in an application. However, Microsoft
strongly recommends against this practice, for the following two
reasons:

<OL><P><LI>Future Compatibility. Changes may be made to Windows in future
   versions such that applications that perform these operations
   directly may not execute reliably.

<P><LI>Portability. Applications that perform these operations directly
   will be more difficult to port to different hardware platforms
   (such as Windows running on a different machine architecture).
<P>
</OL>In summary, executing low-level operations from within a Windows-based
application may, in a future version of Windows, produce unexpected
results, generate unnecessary maintenance overhead, and have severe
impact on the potential lifetime of that application. To avoid these
problems, machine-specific functionality should be coded in a DLL.
