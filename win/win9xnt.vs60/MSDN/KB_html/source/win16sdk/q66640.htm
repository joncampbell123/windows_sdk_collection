The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.0 and 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows-based applications can access more than 20 files. To do this, call
the SetHandleCount() function with the number of files needed for the
application. The return value from this function specifies the exact number
of handles that the application can use. Note that the maximum number of
handles that can be requested is 255, and what is returned can be a number
less than requested.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Every Windows-based application is given enough memory when it is loaded to
access 20 file handles. This default setting is the same as the setting
used in the C run-time libraries. Similarly, the first 5 handles are
reserved for basic file I/O, as with any other MS-DOS-based application,
leaving the other 15 available for the Windows-based application to use.
<P>
When you call SetHandleCount(), the file handle location in the
application's program segment prefix (PSP) is expanded to reflect the
number of files requested. Because the PSP is unique for every instance of
every application, the change in the file handle count will be internal to
the application that called SetHandleCount(). No other changes are made in
the system. Furthermore, the number of files that may be opened by this
application, set by SetHandleCount(), is not limited by the FILES
environment variable, declared in the CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
To use these handles, you must also use the Windows file I/O routines
(_lopen(), _lclose(), _lread(), and so forth). These routines are versions
of the C run-time routines modified to accept a handle value greater than
20. If the Windows file I/O functions do not offer enough flexibility,
routines must be written by the ISV with the appropriate functionality
using Int 21H calls. If Int 21H calls are to be used, we recommend that
these calls be performed in a dynamic-link library (DLL). Doing this will
make it easier to service the code in the future if significant changes are
made with the Windows file I/O routines.
<P>
If you want to use the C run-time functions instead of using the Windows
file I/O routines or writing each routine separately, you must modify the C
run-time code to increase the file handle limit. For more information on
increasing the file limit, query in the C language Knowledge Base or
consult the documentation supplied with the Microsoft C Compiler. Once the
C run-time code has been modified, the C run-time routines can be used
within the limit of file handles set during the modification. A modified C
run-time routine will fail if it is passed a file handle value greater than
the new limit that was set.
<P>
The above approaches are the only acceptable methods of using more than the
default 20 file handles in a Windows-based application. If you attempt to
increase the number of files by calling Int 21H, Function 67H, important
information will not be recorded in Windows and you will experience
problems using file handles over the default number.
<P>
There is a sample application named HANDLCNT in the Microsoft Software
Library that demonstrates the use of SetHandleCount().
