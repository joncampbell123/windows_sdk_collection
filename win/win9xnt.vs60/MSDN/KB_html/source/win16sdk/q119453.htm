The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows,
   version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
During the playback of a metafile or printing, the GDI heap fills up and it
is not possible to create additional GDI objects.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This filling of the GDI heap can be caused by a metafile that does not
contain any DELETEOBJECT metafile records. The GDI objects created during
the metafile playback never get deleted, which fills up the GDI heap. An
application that prints without using banding in Windows version 3.1 causes
a metafile to be created on behalf of the application. The problem listed
above then occurs.
<P>
The DELETEOBJECT metafile record is a new feature developed for Windows
version 3.1. This record is used to record DeleteObject() calls into the
metafile, so that the specified GDI object is deleted during playback of
the metafile. If you call DeleteObject() on an object that is currently
selected into a metafile device context (DC), a DELETEOBJECT record will
not be recorded into the metafile. The documentation for DeleteObject()
states that the object must not be selected into a DC.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Make sure to deselect the object in your metafile DC before calling
DeleteObject() to delete the object. For more information on calling
DeleteObject() for a metafile object, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
