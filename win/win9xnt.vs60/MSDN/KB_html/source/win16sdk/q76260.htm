The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.0 and 3.1

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows provides a device-independent platform for application developers.
Device independence applies to printing as well. To write code to work with
any printer driver, applications must not rely on any special feature in a
printer driver. Instead, applications should direct all requests through
the Windows Graphical Device Interface (GDI).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two major classes of printers: raster printers and PostScript
printers. This article is directed towards application support for raster
printers.
<P>
With the exception of the standard printer escapes, applications should not
rely on any printer escape to be supported in a particular printer driver.
Note that the printer escapes are supported in Windows 3.1, but it is
recommended that you use the new equivalent functions, instead of the
escapes.
<P>
The standard escapes/functions are: STARTDOC/StartDoc(), ENDDOC/EndDoc(),
NEXTBAND, NEWFRAME, SETABORTPROC/SetAbortProc(), and ABORTDOC/AbortDoc().
The remaining escapes are optional for printer drivers. Applications should
use the QUERYESCSUPPORT escape to test for the support of optional escapes.
Applications should not depend on private knowledge of how a particular
driver works.
<P>
For example, the DRAWPATTERNRECT escape is available on certain
devices. The following code fragment determines if the DRAWPATTERNRECT
escape is supported on the installed device. If not, an alternative
function, PatBlt(), is used to create the output.
<P>
<PRE>  short i;

  i = DRAWPATTERNRECT;

  if (Escape(hPr, QUERYESCSUPPORT, sizeof(i), (LPSTR)&amp;i, NULL))
      Escape(hPr, DRAWPATTERNRECT, sizeof(lpPatRect),
               (LPSTR)lpPatRect, NULL);
  else
      PatBlt(hPr, .....);

</PRE>Of the remaining escapes, the following are used frequently:
GETPHYSPAGESIZE, GETPRINTINGOFFSET, PASSTHROUGH, and DRAWPATTERNRECT.
An application should minimize the number of escapes that it uses.
<P>
Another area of device independence applies to ExtDeviceMode().
Applications should not allow the user to change printer settings globally.
If the user wants to change the printer settings for all applications, the
Control Panel utility should be used. It is more appropriate for printer
settings to be associated with an application, a document, or a particular
set of pages in a document. For more information please see the Knowledge
Base article
