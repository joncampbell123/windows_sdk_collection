The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.0 and 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
When writing Windows-based applications that may be placed on a network, it
is necessary to consider the demands of the MS-DOS SHARE utility and of the
network when designing the application.
<P>
If the application is written to conform to the normal MS-DOS INT 21H
protocol and the network supports shared access, then the application
will run properly. Most network vendors implement some kind of file
sharing system that handles multiple files accessed across the
network.
<P>
In many cases, network applications are not tested properly. It is
necessary to test the worst-case scenario, where the same file is
opened by more than one workstation simultaneously and manipulated
using standard file I/O instructions (read, write, close, and so
forth).
<P>
When the MS-DOS SHARE utility is run from a workstation, only the files
on that workstation are shared. However, if SHARE is not run on the
network server, applications will encounter problems. All Microsoft
LAN Manager servers load SHARE so that file sharing is virtually
transparent to the user. It is the user's responsibility to verify the
network's implementation of shared files.
<P>
The "IBM DOS Technical Reference" shows the normal file operations
table. This should be used as the guideline when network applications
are implemented.
