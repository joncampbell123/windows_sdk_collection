<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows graphical environment creates and stores objects
on behalf of each application in the system. Two places store many of
these objects, the user heap and the graphics device interface (GDI)
heap, each one limited to 64K. This article discusses the objects,
their size, and how to maximize the use of the heaps.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A good way to see what is stored in the heaps is to use the Heap
Walker tool (HEAPWALK.EXE) provided with the Microsoft Windows
Software Development Kit (SDK). Heap Walker is documented in Chapter
11 of the SDK Tools manual for Windows 3.0 and in Chapter 9 of the SDK
Programming Tools manual for Windows 3.1. The memory management
practices of Windows are documented in Chapters 15 and 16 of the SDK
Guide to Programming for Windows 3.0. Further information on Windows
memory management is available in Charles Petzold's "Programming
Windows" (Microsoft Press) and in Peter Norton and Paul Yao's "Windows
3.0 Power Programming Techniques" (Bantam Computer Books).
<P>
The following table lists the objects stored in the user heap and the
typical sizes for these items:
<P>
<PRE>   Object          Size in Bytes
   ------          -------------
   Menu            20 + 20 per menu item
   Window Class    40 to 50
   Window          60 to 70

</PRE>Note that every running program requires space in the user heap. Every
application must use this shared resource wisely. One technique to
reduce heap requirements is through the judicious use of resources.
For example, static strings should be placed into a string table
instead of being stored as string variables. If a group of
applications shares a common set of resources, place the resources
into a dynamic-link library (DLL). Multiple applications can share one
copy of code, data, and resources through a DLL.
<P>
Another way to reduce heap requirements is through the use of class
extra bytes and window extra bytes. Although these bytes are stored on
the user heap, each is associated with a particular window or window
class. These bytes are convenient places to store a handle to a data
structure that has been allocated from global memory.
<P>
Menus are, by far, the biggest consumer of user heap space.
Applications that have multiple menu bars or create menus with the
TrackPopupMenu() API should load these resources only as needed and
destroy them after use, instead of waiting for program termination. In
Windows 3.1, user stores menus in a separate 64K heap.
<P>
When an application creates a GDI object, Windows allocates space from
the GDI heap. While most applications create GDI objects, an
application should not create too many objects at one time. Also, each
object must be destroyed when it is no longer required by the
application. The following table lists the objects stored in the GDI
heap and their typical sizes:
<P>
<PRE>   Object              Size in Bytes
   ------              -------------
   Brush               32
   Bitmap              28 to 32
   Device Context (DC) 300
   Font                40 to 44
   Pen                 28
   Region              28
   Palette             28

</PRE>Items are created in the GDI heap whenever an application creates a
GDI object. Most applications create GDI objects, but an application
should not create too many objects at one time. Also, an object must
be destroyed when it is no longer required by the application.
<P>
The maximum number of windows that can be open simultaneously is
constrained by the amount of space remaining in the user heap. As
noted above, the user and GDI heaps are each limited to 64K.
<P>
Because heap space is shared among all running applications, an
application must check the value returned from each function call to
verify that memory allocations are successful. The debugging version
of Windows produces a FatalExit message when an application uses an
invalid handle. This information is difficult to obtain from any other
source.
