<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK), version 3.1

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
_MSSETUP.EXE disappears from the default directory; in fact, it deletes
itself.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is by design. _MSSETUP.EXE is invoked when the MSSetup script file
calls ExitExecRestart(). This function exits Windows and calls
_MSSETUP.EXE to read any commands that have been placed in _MSSETUP.BAT.
(Commands are placed in _MSSETUP.BAT when a file in the copy list is
specified as a system file that is in use during the Windows portion of
the MSSetup program.) As part of the cleanup before returning to
Windows, _MSSETUP.EXE deletes itself.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you run _MSSETUP.EXE from the MS-DOS command line or from the File
Manager, it looks for _MSSETUP.BAT, does not find it, and then deletes
itself. One way to workaround this is to compress _MSSETUP.EXE so that
it cannot be executed on its own.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: The Setup Toolkit places commands in the _MSSETUP.BAT file to copy
files that are in use during the execution of the Windows portion of the
Setup program. These files are specified in MSSetup's file copy list. For
example, if a copy list includes an update to the SHELL.DLL file, Setup
cannot update the SHELL file while Windows is running.
