   versions 3.1 and 3.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A small or medium model dynamic-link library (DLL) cannot use any of
the C run-time functions provided with Microsoft C version 6.0 to
convert a floating-point number to a character string. However, with
Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0 you can use the fcvt() and ecvt()
functions. The Windows wsprintf() function does not provide any
assistance because wsprintf() does not support floating-point numbers.
Therefore, a DLL must be compiled with Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0 or
provide its own code to perform the conversion.
<P>
DLLFLOAT is a file in the Software Library that contains a DLL-
compatible function to convert a floating-point number to a character
string.
<P>
Download DLLFLOAT.EXE, a self-extracting file, from the Microsoft Software
Library (MSL) on the following services:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Download Service (MSDL)
<P><PRE>      Dial (206) 936-6735 to connect to MSDL
      Download <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/dllfloat.exe">DLLFLOAT.EXE</A> <I>(size: 50225 bytes)</I> 
</PRE>
<LI>Internet (anonymous FTP)
<P><PRE>      ftp ftp.microsoft.com
      Change to the \SOFTLIB\MSLFILES directory
      Get <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/dllfloat.exe">DLLFLOAT.EXE</A> <I>(size: 50225 bytes)</I> 
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the Windows environment, an application can use the C run-time
functions ecvt, fcvt, gcvt, and sprintf to convert a floating-point
number to a character string. However, none of these functions can be
used in a DLL because a DLL's data segment is not equal to its stack
segment and the design of each function assumes that the two segments
are identical.
<P>
To work around this assumption, a DLL must contain its own code to
perform the conversion. The DLLFLOAT example in the Microsoft Software
Library creates a function called ConvertFltToStr to convert a number
of the DOUBLE data type to a character string.
<P>
Even though ConvertFltToStr is a self-contained function, DLLFLOAT
contains a supporting function, MYfrexp, that works around a problem
in the small and medium model Microsoft C 6.0 run-time libraries.
ConvertFltToStr calls the frexp function to retrieve the mantissa and
exponent of the floating-point number. However, there is a problem
with the frexp function in the Microsoft C 6.0 small and medium model
DLL run-time libraries. For more information on this problem, please
query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   frexp

</PRE>The ConvertFltToStr and MYfrexp functions can be easily incorporated
into a DLL. All required variables and manifest constants are declared
inside each function. The DLL must declare a global or static string
variable to accept the results of the conversion and must include some
standard C run-time header files.
<P>
If the floating-point number is of an order of magnitude greater than
10 or less than negative 10, ConvertFltToStr converts the number using
scientific notation. Different formatting can be achieved by modifying
the code.
