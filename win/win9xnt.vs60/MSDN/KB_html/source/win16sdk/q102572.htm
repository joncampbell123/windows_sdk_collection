<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
The following changes have been made from the Windows 3.1 version of
DDEML to the version that shipped with Windows for Workgroups (WFW)
version 3.1:

<UL><LI>The default shutdown timeout was changed from 3,000 milliseconds to
   30,000 milliseconds.

<LI>DdeQueryConvInfo() added support for the new hwnd and hwndPartner
   fields.

<LI>DdeQueryConvInfo() added more robust handling for improper setting
   of the CONVINFO structure's cb field when called.

<LI>Rewrote DdePostAdvise() to supply the correct count of remaining
   transactions to be processed on the same topic!item!format name set
   for the XTYP_ADVREQ transaction.

<LI>Disallow synchronous calls if the application is shutting down, or
   if already in the middle of a synchronous transaction.

<LI>DdeUninitialize() was fixed to defer processing if called while in
   the middle of a synchronous transaction.

<LI>DdeUninitialize() was fixed to dispatch any pending DDE messages and
   to make necessary callbacks before quitting.

<LI>Added call to DdeUninitialize() from within DdeClientTransaction()
   when in the middle of a synchronous transaction and
   DdeUninitialize() had been called.

<LI>Allow any instance to call DdeCreateStringHandle().

<LI>Have DdeAbandonTransaction() only mark abandoned transactions,
   rather than trying to remove the transaction from internal
   structures.

<LI>Alter PostMessage() overflow queuing to queue based on target
   instead of on the same task, so that one target queue overflow does
   not bog down all PostMessage() calls.
