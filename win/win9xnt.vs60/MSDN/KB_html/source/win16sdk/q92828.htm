<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
HIDAPP is a sample DLL (dynamic-link library) that uses a hidden
application to do file I/O for the DLL. Using this architecture, it is
possible for multiple applications to link to the DLL and access the file
through the DLL.
<P>
Download HIDAPP.EXE from the Microsoft Software Library (MSL) on the
following services:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Download Service (MSDL)
<P><PRE>      Dial (206) 936-6735 to connect to MSDL
      Download <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/hidapp.exe">HIDAPP.EXE</A> <I>(size: 41742 bytes)</I> 
</PRE>
<LI>Internet (anonymous FTP)
<P><PRE>      ftp ftp.microsoft.com
      Change to the \SOFTLIB\MSLFILES directory
      Get <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/hidapp.exe">HIDAPP.EXE</A> <I>(size: 41742 bytes)</I>

</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
It is often desirable to have a DLL open and manage a data file. This way,
many applications can link to the DLL and access the file. Because all
access is done through the DLL, there are no problems associated with
having more than one application opening the file at the same time.
<P>
Under Windows, DLLs cannot own files; only applications can. File handles
are indices into the file table, which is stored in the task database. When
a DLL opens a file, the application that called the DLL owns that file
handle. If a DLL saves the file handle in a global variable and then later
tries to use it when it is called by a different application, then that
file handle will be invalid.
<P>
This HIDAPP sample application discusses one way to work around this
limitation. It consists of a DLL that uses a hidden application to access
files for the DLL that act as a server. When the first instance of client
application links to the DLL, the hidden application is executed and a data
file is opened. The handle for this data file is owned by the hidden
application. After this, other client applications may link to the DLL and
call functions to add and retrieve records from the data file. When the
last client application shuts down, the DLL closes the data file and shuts
down the hidden application.
