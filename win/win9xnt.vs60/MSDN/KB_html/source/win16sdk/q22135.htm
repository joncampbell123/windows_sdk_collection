<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following provides information about the usage of the DEVICEDATA
escape.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The term "#define DEVICEDATA 19" was previously called PASSTHROUGH;
however, it was later renamed. Using the DEVICEDATA escape, which is
essentially a "pass-through" to the device, will make an application
absolutely device dependent.
<P>
The primary use of the DEVICEDATA escape is to download information
that needs to be in the printer (that is, information that should be
there, however, the programmer knows is not there) or to set the
printer state. The DEVICEDATA escape will not interact with the GDI in
a reasonable way; however, it allows device-driver writers to provide
escapes directly into a printer for functions supported there. In
particular, if the state in a printer is set to something other than
what GDI thinks it to be, the results could be unpredictable. For
example, a simple dump of text strings could be sent to a device.
However, the programmer must be sure that the printer is in text mode
(that is, not in graphics mode) before the programmer attempts this
procedure.
<P>
A better way to perform a "quick and dirty" print is to set the
requested print quality to Draft. Time-conscious drivers would
probably use intrinsic fonts for draft-quality printing (no assertion
has been made that there are any drivers out there that actually do
this; it is part of the semantics of draft-quality printing).
<P>
To summarize this information, the DEVICEDATA escape provides a simple
way to send a string of bytes to a device; however, it does not
provide a simple way to print to the device. It is device-dependent as
to whether those bytes get printed, are interpreted as a downloaded
font, reset printer characteristics, and so on. The DEVICEDATA escape
should not be considered a substitute for using the GDI interface. For
these reasons, Microsoft recommends that this escape never be used by
well-behaved applications.
