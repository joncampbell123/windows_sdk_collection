<P>
This article discusses the DIB (device-independent bitmap) concept from
definition and structure to the API that uses it. Included is a small
sample application that illustrates some of the most common methods of
using DIBs to display and manipulate digital images. Functions discussed
are GetDIBits(), SetDIBits(), CreateDIBitmap(), SetDIBitsToDevice(),
StretchDIBits(), and CreateDIBPatternBrush(). This article does not discuss
using palettes with DIBs.
<P>
<P><h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
 
<P>
A DIB (device-independent bitmap) is a format used to define device-
independent bitmaps in various color resolutions. The main purpose of DIBs
is to allow bitmaps to be moved from one device to another (hence, the
device-independent part of the name). A DIB is an external format, in
contrast to a device-dependent bitmap, which appears in the system as a
bitmap object (created by an application using CreateBitmap(),
CreateCompatibleBitmap(), CreateBitmapIndirect(), or CreateDIBitmap()). A
DIB is normally transported in metafiles (usually using the StretchDIBits()
function), BMP files, and the Clipboard (CF_DIB data format).
<P>
A DIB consists of two parts: the bits themselves and a header that
describes the format of the bits. The header contains the color format, a
color table, and the size of the bitmap. The current DIB format supports
four color resolutions: 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit, and 24 bit. In 1-bit, 4-bit,
and 8-bit DIBs, the pixels are defined by indexes (of the appropriate bit
resolution) into the color table; 24-bit pixels are described as 24-bit
values, 1 byte each for red, green, and blue.
<P>
The DIB functions are:
<P>
<PRE>   GetDIBits           Translates a device-dependent bitmap into the DIB
                       format

   SetDIBits           Translates a DIB's information into device-
                       dependent form

   CreateDIBitmap      Creates a device-dependent bitmap initialized with
                       DIB information

   SetDIBitsToDevice   Sets a DIB directly to the output surface

   StretchDIBits       Moves a rectangle from the DIB to a rectangle on
                       the destination surface, stretching or compressing
                       as necessary

   CreateDIBPatternBrush
                       Creates a pattern brush using a DIB for the bitmap

</PRE><h2>DEVICE INDEPENDENCE - WHAT'S IT GOOD FOR?</h2>
 
<P>
Transferring color bitmaps from one device to another was not possible in
versions of the Microsoft Windows graphical environment earlier than 3.0.
With DIBs, each device displays the image to the extent of its color
resolution. An application can store an image in the DIB format and then
display it, regardless of the output device; an application need no longer
create a version of each image for each type of device.
<P>
This image transfer ability can be used to print halftone images. For
example, the StretchDIBits() function can pass a DIB directly to an
intelligent printer driver. Given the full color information of the image
instead of simply a monochrome version (the traditional method), the driver
can use halftones to print a realistic picture.
<P>
Because the DIB format is publicly defined, an application can manipulate
it on the fly. In fact, an application can build an image without any
interaction with Windows. If Windows lacks a drawing primitive, the
application can simulate it directly into the DIB instead of using the
existing graphics device interface (GDI) primitives. Unfortunately, under
Windows versions 3.0 and 3.1, GDI cannot perform output operations directly
to a DIB.
<P>
<P><h2>BMP FILE FORMATS</h2>
 
<P>
The file extension of a Windows DIB file is BMP. The file consists of a
BITMAPFILEHEADER structure followed by the DIB itself. Unfortunately,
because the BITMAPFILEHEADER structure is never actually passed to the API,
not every application that generates BMP files fills out the data structure
carefully. To add to this confusion, the "proper" definition of the
structure is at odds with the documentation. Properly, the data structure
contains the following fields:
<P>
<PRE>   bfType              A WORD that defines the type of file. It must be
                       'BM'.

   bfSize              A DWORD that specifies the size of the file in
                       bytes. The Microsoft Windows Software Development
                       Kit (SDK) documentation claims otherwise. To be on
                       the safe side, many applications calculate their
                       own sizes for reading in a file.

   bfReserved1,
   bfReserved2         WORDs that must be set to 0.

   bfOffBits           A DWORD that specifies the offset from the
                       beginning of the BITMAPFILEHEADER structure to the
                       start of the actual bits. The DIB header
                       immediately follows the file header, but the
                       actual image bits need not be placed next to the
                       headers in the file.


</PRE>The DIB header immediately follows the BITMAPFILEHEADER structure.
<P>
For a code sample that reads a BMP file, see the sample program.
<P>
<P><h3>The DIB Header</h3>
 
<P>
The header actually consists of two adjoining parts: the header proper and
the color table. Both are combined in the BITMAPINFO structure, which is
what all DIB APIs expect.
<P>
Windows version 3.0 supports two varieties of headers: BITMAPINFOHEADER and
BITMAPCOREHEADER. If at all possible, applications should use only
BITMAPINFOHEADERs. The BITMAPCOREHEADER definition is based on the bitmap
definition from Presentation Manager version 1.1 and is supported for
compatibility.
<P>
During a DIB setting operation, most fields are already filled in by
whoever generated the DIB. Doing a GetDIBits() call, however, provides more
control. The way the header is filled in for this operation defines the
resulting DIB, particularly its color resolution.
<P>
BITMAPINFOHEADER contains the following fields:
<P>
<PRE>   biSize              Should be set to sizeof(BITMAPINFOHEADER). This
                       field defines the size of the header (minus the
                       color table). If a new DIB definition is added, it
                       is identified by a new value for the size. This
                       field is also convenient for calculating a pointer
                       to the color table, which immediately follows the
                       BITMAPINFOHEADER.

   biWidth, biHeight   Define the width and the height of the bitmap in
                       pixels. They are DWORD values for future
                       expansion, and the code in Windows versions 3.0
                       and 3.1 ignores the high word (which should be set
                       to 0).

   biPlanes            Should always be 1. All DIB definitions rely on
                       biBitCount for color resolution definition.

   biBitCount          Defines the color resolution (in bits per pixel)
                       of the DIB. Only four values are valid for this
                       field: 1, 4, 8, and 24. New resolutions (16 bit,
                       for example) may be added in the future, but for
                       now only these four define a valid DIB. Choosing the
                       appropriate value when doing a GetDIBits is
                       discussed below. When performing a Set operation,
                       the value should already be defined for the bits.

   biCompression       Specifies the type of compression. Can be one of
                       three values: BI_RGB, BI_RLE4, or BI_RLE8. The most
                       common and useful choice, BI_RGB, defines a DIB in
                       which all is as it seems. Each block of biBitCount
                       bits defines an index (or RGB value for 24-bit
                       versions) into the color table. The other two
                       options specify that the DIB is stored (or will be
                       stored) using either the 4-bit or the 8-bit run
                       length encoding (RLE) scheme that Windows
                       supports. The RLE formats are especially useful
                       for animation applications and also usually
                       compress the bitmap. BI_RGB format is recommended
                       for almost all purposes. RLE versions, although
                       possibly smaller, are slower to decode, not as
                       widely supported, and extremely painful to band
                       properly.

   biSizeImage         Should contain the size of the bitmap proper in
                       bytes. I say "should" because the field is not
                       necessarily filled in. A call to GetDIBits to
                       generate a DIB fills in this field, but a DIB
                       created manually by an application might not have
                       this filled in. Calculating the size of a bitmap
                       is not hard:

                       biSizeImage = ((((biWidth * biBitCount) + 31)
                                      &amp; ~31) &gt;&gt; 3) * biHeight;

                       The crazy roundoffs and shifts account for the
                       bitmap being DWORD-aligned at the end of every
                       scanline. When nonzero, this field tells an
                       application how much storage space the DIB's bits
                       need. The biSizeImage field really becomes useful
                       when dealing with an RLE bitmap, the size of which
                       depends on how well the bitmap was encoded. If an
                       RLE bitmap is to be passed around, the biSizeImage
                       field is essential.

   biXPelsPerMeter,
   biYPelsPerMeter     Define application-specified values for the
                       desirable dimensions of the bitmap. This
                       information can be used to maintain the physical
                       dimensions of an image across devices of different
                       resolutions. GDI never touches these fields. When
                       not filled in, they should both be set to 0.

   biClrUsed           Provides a way for getting smaller color tables.
                       When this field is set to 0, the number of colors
                       in the color table is based on the biBitCount
                       field (1 indicates 2 colors, 4 indicates 16, 8
                       indicates 256, and 24 indicates no color table). A
                       nonzero value specifies the exact number of colors
                       in the table. So, for example, if an 8-bit DIB
                       uses only 17 colors, then only those 17 colors
                       need to be defined in the table, and biClrUsed is
                       set to 17. Of course, no pixel can have an index
                       pointing past the end of the table.

                       Note: This field cannot be used during a GetDIBits
                       operation. GDI always fills a full-size color
                       table. The field is therefore more useful for
                       post-processing operations, when an application
                       trims down the contents of the DIB. If nonzero for
                       a 24-bit DIB, it indicates a table that the
                       application can use for color reference.

   biClrImportant      Specifies that the first x colors of the color
                       table are important to the DIB. If the rest of the
                       colors are not available, the image still retains
                       its meaning in an acceptable manner.
                       biClrImportant is purely for application use; GDI
                       does not touch this value. When this field is set
                       to 0, all the colors are important, or rather,
                       their relative importance has not been computed.

</PRE>The color table immediately follows the header information. No color table
is defined for 24-bit DIBs. The table consists of an array of RGBQUAD data
structures. (The table for the BITMAPCOREINFO format is built with the
RGBTRIPLE data structure.) Red, green, and blue bytes are in reverse order
(red swaps position with blue) from the Windows convention. This is another
leftover from Presentation Manager compatibility.
<P>
The size of the color table depends on the biBitCount value (and can
be overwritten using the biClrUsed field; see above):
<P>
<PRE>   if (!(nNumColors = biClrUsed))
   {
     if (biBitCount != 24)
          nNumColors = 1 &lt;&lt; biBitCount;
   }
   nTableSize = nNumColors * sizeof(RGBQUAD);

</PRE>Most DIBs floating around currently have biClrUsed set to 0, but if any
full-fledged DIB bashing is planned, it is a good idea to set it properly.
If biClrUsed is nonzero, a color table with 24-bit DIBs is possible. GDI
does not use this color table, but the application can use it to determine
the important colors used in the DIB.
<P>
All DIB functions include a wUsage parameter, which can affect the
definition of the color table. This article avoids using palettes with
DIBs, and thereby assumes that wUsage is always set to DIB_RGB_COLORS and
that the color table is therefore always composed of RGB values. When
DIB_PAL_COLORS is used, the color table consists of WORD values that are
indexes into the currently selected logical palette. (This topic is
discussed in detail in the "Using DIBs with Palettes" article.)
<P>
<P><h3>Bit Formats</h3>
 
<P>
The header defines the format of the bits, but all formats share the
following rules:

<UL><LI>Every scanline is DWORD-aligned. The scanline is buffered to
   alignment; the buffering is not necessarily 0.

<LI>The scanlines are stored upside down, with the first scan (scan 0)
   in memory being the bottommost scan in the image. (See Figure 1.)
   This is another artifact of Presentation Manager compatibility. GDI
   automatically inverts the image during the Set and Get operations.
<P>
<P>
   Figure 1. (Embedded image showing memory and screen representations.)
<P>

<LI>64K segment boundaries are not respected; scanlines can cross such
   boundaries (unlike the device-dependent bitmap format that is
   buffered to 64K boundaries).
<P>
</UL>Each format has the following specifics:

<UL><LI>1-bit DIBs are stored using each bit as an index into the color
   table. The most significant bit is the leftmost pixel.
<P>
</UL>-  4-bit DIBs are stored with each 4 bits representing an index into
<PRE>   the color table. The most significant nibble is the leftmost pixel.

</PRE><LI>8-bit DIBs are the easiest to store because each byte is an index.

<LI>24-bit DIBs have every 3 bytes representing a color, using the same
   ordering as the color table. This format is especially tricky
   during processing because a 64K boundary can exist in the middle of
   a color triple -- a difficult condition that must be handled with care.
<P>
<P>
</UL><h2>USING THE DIB API</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>GetDIBits() and SetDIBits()</h3>
 
<P>
These two functions are used to convert device-independent bitmaps into
device-dependent bitmaps and vice versa. SetDIBits() converts a DIB to a
device-dependent bitmap, and GetDIBits() generates a DIB from a device-
dependent bitmap.
<P>
The device driver referenced by the hDC passed into both calls performs the
actual translation. Some device drivers may not have this functionality
(for example, a Windows version 2.0 driver or a primitive Windows version
3.0 driver). In this case, GDI simulates the translation, but only in
monochrome -- color information is converted to black and white. For the
most part, however, this is not a concern. All self-respecting display
drivers support this functionality, and only a few printer drivers do not
provide the translation, usually monochrome drivers for which the GDI
simulations suffice.
<P>
GetDeviceCaps(hDC, RASTERCAPS) returns a WORD value with flags set
indicating which DIB functions the driver supports. RC_DI_BITMAP indicates
support of GetDIBits() and SetDIBits(), RC_DIBTODEV indicates support of
SetDIBitsToDevice(), and RC_STRETCHDIB indicates support of
StretchDIBits(). Any function not supported can be simulated, although the
simulations are often not as useful as the real thing (mainly because color
information is lost). A device may be unable to support the full
functionality even if a bit is set. For example, a device could support
StretchDIBits but only for integral stretches. Unfortunately, an
application has no way to determine the completeness of the implementation.
In these cases, GDI simulates the function.
<P>
The parameters are the same for both GetDIBits() and SetDIBits():
<P>
GetDIBits(hDC, hBitmap, nStartScan, nNumScans, lpBits, lpBitmapInfo,
wUsage)
<P>
SetDIBits(hDC, hBitmap, nStartScan, nNumScans, lpBits, lpBitmapInfo,
wUsage)
<P>
<PRE>hDC            The device context (DC) responsible for the translation
               operation. hDC must be compatible with the hBitmap
               parameter.

hBitmap        The device-dependent bitmap from which (Get) or to
               which (Set) the DIB will be translated. Because of how
               the simulation code operates, this bitmap should not be
               currently selected into any DC.

</PRE>nStartScan,
<PRE>nNumScans      Define the contents of lpBits. For example, a StartScan
               of 5 indicates that lpBits points to the fifth scan of
               the DIB. A NumScans of 14 indicates that lpBits points
               to 14 scans of the DIB. Normally, nStartScan is set to
               0 and nNumScans is set to biHeight to denote that the
               whole DIB is pointed to by lpBits.

lpBits         The actual bitmap of the DIB. The pixel information is
               pointed to by this parameter.

lpBitmapInfo   The header (with color table) defining the DIB. The
               height and width in this header must match the height
               and width of the hBitmap parameter (the translation is
               always 1-to-1). The color resolution of the DIB need
               not match that of hBitmap.

wUsage         For the purposes of this article, assume this to be
               DIB_RGB_COLORS, indicating RGB colors in the color
               table.

</PRE>Using SetDIBits() is reasonably straightforward. A DIB is taken from
somewhere (for example, from the Clipboard or from a disk file) and is
converted to a bitmap object, which can then be selected into a DC and
blted to the screen for display. This is the simplest way to display a
DIB.
<P>
NOTE: For many printers that can do halftones, this method is not
preferred; StretchDIBits (discussed below) is far more useful.
<P>
The following is a simple display of a DIB to a DC (with no error
handling):
<P>
<PRE>   HBITMAP hBitmap;
   HDC hMemDC;

   hBitmap = CreateCompatibleBitmap(hDC, (WORD)lpInfo-&gt;biWidth,
          lpInfo-&gt;(WORD)biHeight);
   hMemDC = CreateCompatibleDC(hDC);
   SetDIBits(hDC, hBitmap, 0, (WORD)lpInfo-&gt;biHeight, lpBits,
          lpBitmapInfo, DIB_RGB_COLORS);
   hBitmap = SelectObject(hMemDC, hBitmap);
   BitBlt(hDC, 0, 0, (WORD)lpInfo-&gt;biWidth, (WORD)lpInfo-&gt;biHeight,
          hMemDC, 0, 0, SRCCOPY);
   DeleteObject(SelectObject(hMemDC, hBitmap));
   DeleteDC(hMemDC);

</PRE>Using GetDIBits() is more complex because the application can choose
what kind of DIB to generate. The size of the source bitmap regulates
the DIB's dimensions (a piece can be extracted by blting into a
smaller bitmap), but the application's need can dictate the color
resolution.
<P>
For GetDIBits() to work properly, the application needs to set the
following fields in the header:
<P>
<PRE>   biSize = sizeof(BITMAPINFOHEADER)
   biWidth = (width of the bitmap)
   biHeight = (height of the bitmap)
   biPlanes = 1
   biBitCount = [desired color resolution (1, 4, 8, or 24)]
   biCompression = BI_RGB (For RLE information, see below.)

</PRE>Also, the space allocated for the color table must be sufficient to
hold a full-size table:
<P>
<PRE>   if (biBitCount != 24)
     nSizeTable = (1 &lt;&lt; biBitCount) * sizeof(RGBQUAD)
   else
     nSizeTable = 0;

</PRE>The space allocated for lpBits also needs to be large enough to hold
nNumScans of data. The call fills in the following fields of the
structure:

<UL><LI>biSizeImage = size in bytes of the DIB data

<LI>Color table (for non-24-bit case) is filled with appropriate colors

<LI>lpBits is filled with the DIB data
<P>
</UL>If GetDIBits() is called with lpBits set to NULL, no bits are returned;
only biSizeImage and the color table are filled in. This option is
useful for DIBs with RLE and is not worthwhile for non-encoded DIBs.
<P>
The application's goals for the DIB determine what color resolution to
choose. The usual approach is to generate a DIB that preserves the
color information of the source device-dependent bitmap. Choosing a
lesser resolution results in a loss of color information, which is
usually undesirable. Always using 24-bit resolution is unnecessary,
however, because doing so adds no more color resolution if the source
has 8-bit or less resolution.
<P>
<PRE>   BITMAP bm;

   // get information on bitmap
   GetObject(hBitmap, sizeof(BITMAP), (LPVOID)&amp;bm);

   BitmapRes = bm.bmPlanes * bm.bmBitsPixel;
   if (BitmapRes == 1)
     biBitCount = 1;
   else if (BitmapRes &lt;= 4)
     biBitCount = 4;
   else if (BitmapRes &lt;= 8)
     biBitCount = 8;
   else
     biBitCount = 24;

</PRE>The bitmap's resolution calculation must take into account that some
device-dependent bitmaps are planar (notably EGA and VGA). DIBs, on
the other hand, are always "packed pixel," with only 1 plane per pixel
(biPlanes = 1).
<P>
The nStartScan and nNumScans parameters (a residue of Presentation
Manager compatibility) are designed to be used for banding. If not
enough memory is available to load the entire DIB into memory in one
piece, lpBits can be made to point to only a portion of the bits.
Consider the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   #define MAXREAD 5
   WORD ReadXScans(LPSTR, WORD);   // Read up to X scans; return
                                   // NumRead.
   LPSTR lpBits;                   // Points to a block of memory for
                                   // MAXREAD scans.
   LPBITMAPINFOHEADER lpInfo;
   WORD nStart, nNumRead;

   for (nStart = 0; nStart &gt;= (WORD)lpInfo-&gt;biHeight; )
   {
     nNumRead = ReadXScans(lpBits, MAXREAD);
     SetDIBits(hDC, hBitmap, nStart, nNumRead,
          lpBits, lpInfo, DIB_RGB_COLORS);
     nStart += nNumRead;
   }

</PRE>The Set code takes the given band, translates it, and puts the
translated band in its proper location, accounting at all times for
the upside-down nature of DIBs. Notice how biHeight does not change at
any time because the band is placed in the bitmap based on the height
of the full bitmap. nStart is based on the height of the full image
(defined by biHeight).
<P>
<P><h3>CreateDIBitmap()</h3>
 
<P>
The following code demonstrates calling CreateDIBitmap() with the usual
case:
<P>
<PRE>   hBitmap = CreateDIBitmap(hDC, lpInfo, CBM_INIT, lpBits, lpInfo,
                            wUsage);

</PRE>This is equivalent to:
<P>
<PRE>   hBitmap = CreateCompatibleBitmap(hDC, (WORD)lpInfo-&gt;biWidth,
             (WORD)lpInfo-&gt;biHeight);
   SetDIBits(hDC, hBitmap, 0, (WORD)lpInfo-&gt;biHeight, lpBits, lpInfo,
             wUsage);

</PRE>GDI's implementation skips the SetDIBits() part if the third parameter
is not set with the CBM_INIT flag. This function makes for nice
shortcut coding of the conversion from DIB to device-dependent bitmap.
<P>
<P><h3>SetDIBitsToDevice()</h3>
 
<P>
SetDIBitsToDevice() allows an application to set a DIB directly to a device
surface. Because this function is a holdout from early development, its
interface is not as polished as it could be. StretchDIBits() is a far more
powerful function than SetDIBitsToDevice(). StretchDIBits() does all that
SetDIBitsToDevice() does and has a nicer interface. SetDIBitsToDevice() is
limited in the way it handles metafiles because it does not scale, and
banding with the nStartScan and nNumScans parameters is nontrivial at best.
StretchDIBits() does not allow the banding.
<P>
The following code performs the SetDIBitsToDevice() functionality on the
full bitmap (no banding) using StretchDIBits:
<P>
<PRE>   StretchDIBits(hDC, x, y, (WORD)lpInfo-&gt;biWidth,
          (WORD)lpInfo-&gt;biHeight, 0, 0, (WORD)lpInfo-&gt;biWidth,
          (WORD)lpInfo-&gt;biHeight, lpBits, lpInfo, DIB_RGB_COLORS,
          SRCCOPY)

</PRE>Assuming that nStartScan is set to 0 and that nNumScans is set to
lpInfo-&gt;biHeight (that is, no banding), the function is basically a
BitBlt with SRCCOPY as the ROP and with a DIB as the source. SrcX and
SrcY are in the DIB's space and are therefore upside down in relation
to the DC (Y = 0 is at the bottom of the image).
<P>
Dealing with the upside-down DIB is tricky when doing a partial
setting. For example, if an application wants to get the bottom third
of a DIB that is w by h pixels to the device at (x, y), the call would
resemble the following:
<P>
<PRE>   SetDIBitsToDevice(hDC, x, y, w, h/3, 0, h/3, 0,
          (WORD)lpInfo-&gt;biHeight, lpBits, lpInfo, DIB_RGB_COLORS);

</PRE>A device-dependent bitmap would have a SrcY of 2h/3 for the bottom
third, but with the upside-down system of the DIB, a SrcY of h/3
points to the proper place relative to Windows coordinates.
<P>
<P><h3>StretchDIBits()</h3>
 
<P>
This function is the do-all darling for displaying a DIB on the
surface of a device. It is especially nice for metafiling and for
printing, for which the ability to stretch is important.
<P>
The one critical hole in the current implementation of StretchDIBits()
is that StretchDIBits() is supported by printer drivers and not by many
display drivers. Therefore, using this function repeatedly to stretch
a DIB to the screen is significantly slower than using SetDIBits (to
get a device-dependent bitmap) followed by repeated StretchBlt() calls.
<P>
The implementation of this function in GDI is very straightforward. If
the device driver can handle the call itself, it does. If not, and the
call is 1-to-1 and the device supports SetDIBitsToDevice(), the call is
converted to a SetDIBitsToDevice() call to the driver. (This works only
with SRCCOPY as the ROP.) If neither of these methods is possible,
CreateDIBitmap() is used to make a device-dependent version of the
bitmap, and StretchBlt is called to do the actual work.
<P>
The parameters for StretchDIBits() are basically the same as for
StretchBlt() (with the source hDC replaced by lpBits and lpInfo). This
function does not have the nStartScan and the nNumScans parameters of
the other DIB functions, so lpBits always points to the first scan of
the DIB.
<P>
When using this function for anything other than full bitmap
stretches, remember that all of the source coordinates (the ones
relating to the DIB) are in an upside-down system. The function will
appropriately flip the image, but the source rectangle is defined with
Y=0 at the bottom and extents going up. Fortunately, the x-coordinates
use the same conventions as Windows.
<P>
Printer drivers that do support this functionality (for example,
PSCRIPT and HPPCL) usually use a halftone algorithm to output good
color images. Therefore, maintaining DIBs at the highest meaningful
color resolution possible (usually 8 bit) is desirable even if the
output device is monochrome, because the color information is still
useful for good output. Unfortunately, most printer drivers do not
support any ROP other than SRCCOPY.
<P>
<P><h3>CreateDIBPatternBrush()</h3>
 
<P>
This function allows an application to create a pattern brush by
specifying a DIB instead of a device-dependent bitmap, as used in the
CreatePatternBrush() function. A brush created using this function is
used similar to any other brush. The DIB is turned into a
device-dependent bitmap at SelectObject() time for use by the device.
This brush resembles a standard pattern brush to the device.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>DIBS IN THE CLIPBOARD</h2>
 
<P>
Two basic mechanisms for placing DIBs in the Clipboard are using the
CF_DIB data format or placing the DIB into a metafile and using the
CF_METAFILEPICT data format.
<P>
The CF_DIB format uses a packed DIB, in which the bits follow
immediately after the header and the color table. When reading or
creating a packed DIB, an application must properly calculate the size
of the color table to ensure that the bits are in the proper place.
Because all DIB functions expect the DIB as two pointers, one to the
header and one to the bits, the bits pointer must be calculated before
use. (For color table size computations, see the code sample in the
color table description above.)
<P>
The simplest way to place a DIB into a metafile is to use
StretchDIBits():
<P>
<PRE>   hMetaDC = CreateMetaFile((LPSTR) NULL));
   StretchDIBits(hMetaDC, 0, 0, biWidth, biHeight, 0, 0, biWidth,
          biHeight, lpBits, lpInfo, DIB_RGB_COLORS, SRCCOPY);
   hMetafile = CloseMetaFile(hMF);

</PRE>This approach generates a metafile that when played back displays the
DIB to the destination. This method also scales the image to fit the
current mapping scheme if needed. Using metafiles for transfer enables
even applications that are not DIB-aware to paste the contents of the
Clipboard without losing the DIB information.
<P>
<P><h2>RLE FORMATS</h2>
 
<P>
When the biCompression field in a DIB's header is set to either BI_RLE4
(for biBitCount = 4) or BI_RLE8 (for biBitCount = 8), the image has been
run-length encoded. A description of the encoding schemes can be found in
the "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit Reference Volume 2," in the
"BITMAPINFOHEADER" section of the "Data types and Structures" chapter. The
basic scheme involves compressing multiple, horizontally adjacent,
identical pixels into a run encoding. For example, 10 pixels of color index
17 are encoded as a run of length 10 and of index 17. Codes for end-of-scan
and for delta moves are also provided, in which an X and a Y offset are
provided for the next pixel.
<P>
This type of encoding usually compresses the bitmap and is also useful for
creating sprite-type animations, in which only a small part of an image
changes in each frame. The animation capabilities are accomplished by using
delta codes to limit the number of pixels actually being set. Pixels
skipped by a delta move are left untouched.
<P>
The main limitations of RLE DIBs are that an application can neither easily
determine the size of the bitmap in bytes nor point to a certain scanline
without decoding the bitmap from the first scan. The biSizeImage field is
useful in solving the first problem. Decoding, encoding, and generally
manipulating the RLE format is slower and more complicated than the
noncompressed (BI_RGB) format. Some applications -- for example, Paintbrush
-- refuse to read RLE DIBs. Although all APIs accept them, RLE DIBs will
probably not become a universally supported format. Also, because of the
relative rarity of these formats, some device drivers might not have fully
tested support for the encoding and decoding processes.
<P>
To generate an RLE DIB, GetDIBits() is called with biCompression set to the
desired type of encoding. The amount of memory needed to store the bits is
not easily computed. If GetDIBits() is called with lpBits set to NULL, the
amount of memory needed for the bits is returned in biSizeImage. A
subsequent call with lpBits pointing to a properly sized block of memory
returns an encoded bitmap.
<P>
Translating an RLE DIB into a device-dependent form requires no
special processing. Any of the Set functions can be used normally with
a header containing the proper biSizeImage and biCompression values to
match the bits.
<P>
<P><h2>SHORTCOMINGS OF DIBS</h2>
 
<P>
Probably the biggest limitation of DIBs is that they are slower than device-
dependent bitmaps. Translating DIBs into a device-dependent form before
they can actually be displayed requires extra processing, resulting in
additional overhead. In an ideal world, a 1-to-1 StretchDIBits() would be
as fast as a BitBlt(). This speed would allow an application to operate
effectively in the realm of the logical bitmap, with full color and full
access to each and every pixel, regardless of the physical device's
limitations.
<P>
DIBs are based in a coordinate system that is upside down relative to
Windows, making coding a bit frustrating and not intuitive. Always
remembering this quirkiness should help limit the number of iterations
needed to get bitmaps properly lined up.
<P>
You can get full color using 24-bit DIBs, but they are very slow to decode,
read, and write. This is especially true on 8-bit palette devices, in which
translation literally can take minutes. Also, the sheer size of 24-bit DIBs
makes them a bit unwieldy for general use.
<P>
<P><h2>DIB-RELATED PROBLEMS IN WINDOWS VERSION 3.0</h2>
 
<P>
Metafile recording of StretchDIBits() calls that use BITMAPCOREHEADER
causes a UAE. Convert all headers to the BITMAPINFO style to avoid this
problem. This workaround is recommended for general DIB processing.
<P>
The SetDIBits() simulation code for greater than 64K monochrome DIBs causes
crashes or erroneous printouts when using a SetDIBits(), a
SetDIBitsToDevice(), or a StretchDIBits() to a driver that does not support
SetDIBits().
