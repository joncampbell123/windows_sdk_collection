The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If a menu item has tabbed or right-justified text that contains a mnemonic
access character, an ampersand ("&amp;") will appear in front of the desired
access character and the character will not be underlined.
<P>
If the menu item has a cascading menu associated with it, the right-
justified text may partially overwrite the arrow that indicates the
presence of a submenu.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
An ampersand in a menu item string is normally translated into an underline
character and used as the mnemonic access character for that menu item. If
an ampersand occurs in tabbed or right-justified text, however, it will not
cause the character following it to be underlined. Instead, the ampersand
and the access character will be literally displayed as they appear in the
string. Windows does not examine tabbed or right-justified text in menu
strings to determine if the text contains an ampersand that needs to be
converted into an underscore.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Although the access character does not appear underlined in the menu, the
menu item can still be selected by typing the access character. Windows
correctly interprets the ampersand as signaling a mnemonic character, but
does not correctly display the string.
<P>
An example menu item string that demonstrates the problem is:
<P>
<PRE>  "Start\aCtrl+&amp;G"

</PRE>In this example, the menu item is "Start", and the keyboard shortcut
(accelerator) is CTRL+G. When the menu item is displayed, the ampersand and
the "G" will be shown as they appear in the string rather than being
converted into an underlined "G".
<P>
"The Windows Interface: An Application Design Guide" from the Windows SDK
makes a distinction between the menu item and the text that indicates the
keyboard shortcut.
<P>
Each menu item should have a mnemonic access character associated with it.
The use of a mnemonic in a keyboard shortcut is thus non standard.
