<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The explanation of errors R2701 through R2709 is "Internal error," and the
user is directed to contact Microsoft Product Support Services for
clarification. This article contains information on these internal
errors.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The list is:
<P>
R2701:  Creation of title b-tree has failed
R2703:  Creation of bitmap file has failed.
<P>
These two file creation failures can happen due to low memory, low disk
space, or lack of file handles.
<P>
R2705:  Phrase file does not exist.
<P>
This error is given if the phrase file mysteriously disappears between the
time it was created (or checked for existence) and when it is used. It
might be caused by low disk space, or from compiling on the network.
<P>
R2707:  Closing of file has failed.
<P>
This is a disk error that is not out of memory, out of disk space, or out
of file handles. It might indicate hard disk problems such as bad sectors,
or too many files in one directory.
<P>
R2709:  Opening output system file failed.
<P>
If someone does encounter this error, they are using an old Beta version.
