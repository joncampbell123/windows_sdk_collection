<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In the Microsoft Windows environment, device ports are a scarce
resource that are shared by all applications running in the system. If
an application is designed to send raw, unformatted data to a device
port, it should use the Windows Print Spooler to ensure that two or
more applications do not use the port at once.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The best method to implement this functionality is by means of a
device driver through which an application can pass data to the port
without change. Raw.exe is a file in the Microsoft Software Library that
contains the source code to a device driver that implements the
PASSTHROUGH escape function. The RAW printer driver is intended as a
sample driver and has not been designed to be distributed as part of a
commercial application.
<P>

</PRE>Earlier versions of the RAW driver were incompatible with Adobe Type
Manager (ATM) because ATM requires a printer driver to return a
nonzero value when the driver processes the RealizeObject function.
The current version of RAW has been updated to be compatible with ATM.
