The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows version 3.1 Software Development Kit (SDK) provides a
sample called THSAMPLE, which is in the SDK subdirectory \SAMPLES\TOOLHELP.
This sample application uses the TOOLHELP.DLL to provide the type of
information that HEAPWALK shows.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When the THSAMPLE sample application is run and the Enable List option is
enabled from the Notification menu, some of the notification messages are
not seen in the notification window.
<P>
This problem can be demonstrated, for example, by starting the Windows Help
application when the Enable List option is enabled in the THSAMPLE
application. (Note that it is preferable to turn off the task switch
notifications using the Notification/Task Switch Filter option).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There is a simple error in the THSAMPLE application. THSAMPLE uses
NotifyRegister() to register a callback function that receives all
the notification messages. This callback function is then posting a
user-defined message to itself using PostMessage() for every
notification message it receives, and displaying it in the
appropriate window.
<P>
There is a default limit, however, of eight messages that an
application's message queue can hold, whereas the callback could
receive a lot more notifications (for example, when some
applications are started, a number of LOADSEG notifications are
sent).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this behavior, the application's message queue size
must be increased by using SetMessageQueue() set to an appropriate
number. Note that starting and exiting some applications such as
Windows Help, Word for Windows, or Excel will produce a large
number of LOADSEG and FREESEG notifications. Therefore, it is
better to set the message queue size to the maximum of 120 in order
to be able to look at most of the notifications.
