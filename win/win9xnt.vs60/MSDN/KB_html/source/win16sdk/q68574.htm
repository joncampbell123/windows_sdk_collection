<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When an application must draw a large number of lines, the Polyline()
function will execute 1.1 to 1.5 times faster than the equivalent
calls to the LineTo() function on video hardware that does not have a
graphics coprocessor (such as EGA and VGA). On hardware with a
graphics coprocessor (such as an 8514/A), Polyline() can execute up to
12 times faster than LineTo().
<P>
In general, Polyline() is faster than LineTo(). This is magnified by
drawing a very large number of lines. With a small number of lines,
the difference in duration of the calls is negligible compared to the
time required to draw the lines.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
LineTo() and Polyline() both use the same internal code to draw lines,
but with slightly different setup procedures.
<P>
Polyline() calls GlobalAlloc() and copies all points into that memory;
as a result, there is some overhead. A pointer to the memory is passed
to an internal function that draws all the lines.
<P>
LineTo() essentially builds one point and calls the same internal
function as Polyline(). LineTo() does not allocate additional memory.
<P>
Polyline() is much more efficient for a large number of lines, since
an application makes a single call to Windows and setup is only
performed once. A large number of calls to LineTo() introduces
significant overhead to make each call and repeatedly execute the
setup code in LineTo().
