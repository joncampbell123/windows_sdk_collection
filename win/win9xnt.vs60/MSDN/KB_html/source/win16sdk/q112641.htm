<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The sample program EXTDEV2 demonstrates the correct method for calling
ExtDeviceMode() to change the current printer's orientation to landscape.
The sample code can easily be modified to change other printer settings
such as paper size and print quality. This article discusses the steps
necessary for using ExtDeviceMode() properly and includes the
GetPrinterDC() function, which is used to change paper orientation in the
sample.
<P>
EXTDEV2 is based on the PRNTFILE sample from the Windows SDK versions 3.0
and 3.1. EXTDEV2 also corrects a minor bug in the PRNTFILE sample. For
additional information about that bug, please see the following article(s)
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<P>
Beginning with Windows version 3.0, many printer drivers implement a
convention for controlling print settings on a job-by-job basis, without
requiring user intervention via a dialog box. This is accomplished via the
ExtDeviceMode() function as described in Chapter 17 of the Microsoft
Windows SDK "Guide to Programming" for both versions 3.0 and 3.1. The
DeviceCapabilities() function, also introduced in Windows 3.0, provides
information about the print settings supported by a given driver. As of
Windows version 3.1, changes to printer settings are allowed on a page-by-
page basis via the use of the ResetDC() API.
<P>
ExtDeviceMode() and DeviceCapabilities() are supplied by the printer
drivers rather than GDI. Because not all drivers support these functions,
applications must ensure that the driver supports these functions before
attempting to use them.
<P>
Because of the Universal Printer Driver (UNIDRV), almost all Windows 3.1
printer drivers support these functions. The HP Plotter driver (HPPLOT.DRV)
is a notable exception. The only way to change the settings on the HP
Plotter is to display the driver's print setup dialog box, which is
accomplished by calling the driver's DeviceMode function.
<P>
Correct usage of ExtDeviceMode() and DeviceCapabilities() to query and/or
modify printer settings is a multistep process that is not fully explained
in the SDK documentation.
<P>
Because these functions reside in the printer driver rather than GDI,
applications must first get a handle to the driver, typically by calling
LoadLibrary(), and then use GetProcAddress() to get the address of the
driver's ExtDeviceMode() and/or DeviceCapabilities() functions. If
GetProcAddress() returns NULL for either of these functions, then that
function is not supported by the driver.
<P>
Furthermore, because ExtDeviceMode() and DeviceCapabilities() are not
Windows APIs, they are not prototyped in WINDOWS.H. Instead, function
pointer types are defined for both of these functions in PRINT.H included
in the Windows 3.1 SDK and in DRIVINIT.H included in the Windows 3.0 SDK.
Use LPFNDEVMODE for ExtDeviceMode(); use LPFNDEVCAPS for
DeviceCapabilities(). Using these types is important for compiler type-
checking and ensures that the correct arguments are passed on the stack.
Not using these types (for example, using FARPROC) can lead to general
protection (GP) faults in some circumstances.
<P>
PRINT.H (or DRIVINIT.H) also defines the device-independent part of the
DEVMODE structure used for manipulating printer settings. Note that the
DEVMODE structure actually used by a printer driver contains the device-
independent part followed by a driver-specific part that varies in size and
content with each driver and driver version.
<P>
Because of this driver-dependence, it is very important for applications to
query the driver for the correct size of the DEVMODE structure before
allocating a buffer for it.
<P>
The following code fragment loads a printer driver, calls ExtDeviceMode()
(if supported) to get the full DEVMODE size, and allocates a buffer for the
full DEVMODE structure:
<P>
<PRE>   #include &lt;print.h&gt;            // Formerly DRIVINIT.H in 3.0

   HINSTANCE hDriver;            // Handle to driver
   LPFNDEVMODE ExtDeviceMode;    // Function pointer variable
   PDEVMODE pdm;                 // Pointer to DEVMODE struct
   int nSize;                    // Size of printer's DEVMODE struct

   hDriver = LoadLibrary(szDriver);
   if (hDriver &lt; HINSTANCE_ERROR)
     return;                     // Error

   ExtDeviceMode = (LPFNDEVMODE) GetProcAddress(hDriver, "EXTDEVICEMODE");
   if (!ExtDeviceMode)
     {
     FreeLibrary(hDriver);       // ExtDeviceMode() not supported
     return;
     }

   // Get size of DEVMODE
   nSize = ExtDeviceMode(hWnd, hDriver, NULL, szDevice, szPort,
                         NULL, NULL, 0);

   // Allocate buffer for DEVMODE
   pdm = (PDEVMODE) LocalAlloc(LPTR, nSize);  // check for failure!

</PRE>Often, it is desirable to query the driver for the current printer
settings. This can be accomplished by allocating a buffer for the DEVMODE
structure as above, and then calling ExtDeviceMode() a second time, passing
the address of the output buffer and using the DM_OUT_BUFFER flag (also
known as DM_COPY). For example:
<P>
<PRE>  ExtDeviceMode(hWnd, hDriver, pdm, szDevice, szPort, NULL, NULL, DM_COPY);

</PRE>Once the current settings are obtained, applications should use the
dmFields member of the DEVMODE structure to determine which of the
subsequent DEVMODE fields were initialized by the driver. Only fields with
the corresponding bit set in dmFields should be used by the application;
other fields are not supported by the driver.
<P>
To change printer settings, the application should not only change the
appropriate fields of DEVMODE, but also indicate which fields were changed
by setting the corresponding bits in dmFields. For example, the following
code fragment sets landscape printing:
<P>
<PRE>   DWORD dwFields;

   ...

   dwFields = pdm-&gt;dmFields;     // Save this
   pdm-&gt;dmFields = 0             // We haven't changed anything yet

   if (dwFields &amp; DM_ORIENTATION)
     {
     pdm-&gt;dmFields |= DM_ORIENTATION;
     pdm-&gt;dmOrientation = DMORIENT_LANDSCAPE;
     }

   // Continue changing other settings

</PRE>A driver may support modifying a certain DEVMODE field without supporting
all of the available settings for that field. For example, an application
cannot use ExtDeviceMode() to switch to Executive paper if the printer only
supports Letter, Legal, and A4 paper sizes. Applications should use
DeviceCapabilities() to query the driver for this type of information. For
an example of using DeviceCapabilities(), please see the following
article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win16sdk/q81245.htm">Q81245</A></B>
<PRE>TITLE     : DeviceCapabilities() Function Sample Code

</PRE>When the application is done modifying DEVMODE, it is necessary to call
ExtDeviceMode() again to allow the driver to merge the new settings and to
update the driver-dependent part of the DEVMODE structure if necessary.
This is done by providing both an input and an output DEVMODE (a single
buffer can be used) and by using both the DM_OUT_BUFFER and DM_IN_BUFFER
(also known as DM_COPY and DM_MODIFY) flags.
<P>
<PRE>   ExtDeviceMode(hWnd, hDriver, pdm, szDevice, szPort,
                 pdm, NULL, DM_IN_BUFFER|DM_OUT_BUFFER);

</PRE>DEVMODE is now ready for use in CreateDC() or ResetDC() for printing.
<P>
Changes made to printer settings in this manner are specific to the
particular print job. It is also possible to change the system-wide default
settings for a printer by using DM_OUT_DEFAULT (also known as DM_UPDATE) in
addition to DM_IN_BUFFER and DM_OUT_BUFFER in the final call to
ExtDeviceMode() above. However, this is discouraged. It is more appropriate
for the user to make changes to default settings through the Control Panel.
<P>
The following function from the EXTDEV2 sample demonstrates the above
method for changing the printer orientation to landscape:

<P>
There are some common variations to the above method when calling
ExtDeviceMode(). For example, if you just want to create a printer HDC
using the current printer settings, you only need to call ExtDeviceMode()
twice, as described above. The first call is to get the size of the full
DEVMODE and the second call is to get the current printer settings. You
then just pass the initialized LPDEVMODE to CreateDC.
<P>
ExtDeviceMode() can also be used to display the printer driver's setup
dialog box. Note that this dialog box is driver-specific, and may be
slightly different than the common dialog box's (COMMDLG.DLL) setup dialog
box, which is displayed by calling the PrintDlg function.
<P>
To display the driver's setup dialog box with the current printer settings,
you only need to call ExtDeviceMode() twice as describe above but with one
minor change. On the second call to ExtDeviceMode(), use the flags
DM_IN_PROMPT | DM_OUT_BUFFER (also known as DM_PROMPT | DM_COPY). The
DM_IN_PROMPT flag displays the dialog box and the DM_OUT_BUFFER flag copies
the settings from the dialog box into the LPDEVMODE.
<P>
You can also display the driver's setup dialog box and change which dialog
box controls are selected when the dialog box is displayed. For example, if
you want to display the printer driver's setup dialog box but have the
dialog box displayed with the landscape control selected, use the above
approach with one minor change. On the third call to ExtDeviceMode(),
specify the flags DM_OUT_BUFFER | DM_IN_BUFFER | DM_IN_PROMPT. DM_IN_BUFFER
