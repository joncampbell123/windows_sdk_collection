The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows,
   version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
The CALLB application demonstrates how to handle callbacks with C++
member functions. It is a companion application for the technical
article on the MSDN, "Calling All Members: Member Functions as
Callbacks."
<P>
Microsoft Windows version 3.1 has over 30 callback functions
that applications can use to enumerate objects, hook into the
hardware, and perform a variety of other activities. The article
explains why normal member functions cannot be used as callback
functions and gives several techniques for handling callbacks. The
article and source code are targeted toward Microsoft C/C++ version
7.0, but the ideas presented apply to all C++ compilers, including
those by Borland and Zortech.
<P>
CALLB contains eight makefiles that create six executables: MAKE1
creates CPROG1; MAKE2 generates a compile-time error and does not
create an executable; MAKE3, MAKE4, MAKE5, and MAKE6 create CPROG3,
CPROG4, CPROG5, and CPROG6, respectively; and TMAKE creates CTIMER.
Please refer to "Calling All Members: Member Functions as Callbacks"
for more information.
<P>
NOTE: Running CPROG1 generates a general protection (GP) fault by
design.
<P>
CALLB was built and tested under Microsoft Windows version 3.1.
<P>
