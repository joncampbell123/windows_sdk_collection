<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The address of a function exported by an application or DLL must be
resolved by the Windows loader or a call to GetProcAddress() before the
function can be called by another application or DLL. If the function
is exported by ordinal number (or by name and ordinal number), its
address can be resolved by the ordinal number. If no ordinal number is
given for an exported function, it is said to be exported by name only
and its address must be resolved by its name.
<P>
When resolving a reference by name in one application or DLL to a function
exported by another application or DLL, the Windows loader or
GetProcAddress() will convert the function name to uppercase and perform a
case-sensitive search. If a match is not found, the Windows loader displays
a dialog box with the "Call to Undefined Dynalink" message and a button to
close the offending application. If a match is not found, GetProcAddress()
returns NULL to signal failure. One possible cause of these errors is using
the /NOIGNORECASE (/NOI) linker option.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The information in this article depends on the development tools that you
are using. If you are not using Microsoft tools, please refer to the
documentation for your development tools.
<P>
<P><h3>C 6.0 and C/C++ 7.0</h3>
 
<P>
If an application or DLL exports __cdecl functions by name only and
is linked with /NOI (to preseve case), the Windows loader and
GetProcAddress() won't be able to resolve the function names when
performing the dynamic link, because Windows expects the names of the
exported functions to use all uppercase letters, and __cdecl functions use
mixed case. With the /NOI switch, only __pascal functions will be resolved,
because the compiler has already converted the names to all uppercase.
<P>
Without the /NOI switch, the linker will uppercase all function names,
regardless of calling convention (you can verify this in the new executable
header). Therefore the Windows loader and GetProcAddress() are able to
resolve the names.
<P>
<P><h3>Visual C++</h3>
 
<P>
The linker in Visual C++ always capitalizes the names of exported functions
in the DLL executable header, regardless of whether or not you link with
/NOI, and whether they functions are declared __cdecl or not. This was done
to avoid the problems described above. One thing that can cause a problem
is if you run implib on the DLL with /NOI and link your .EXE (or another
DLL) to this implib with /NOI, you'll get unresolved externals because the
import library has the names in all uppercase letters but the .EXE is
calling them mixed-case.
