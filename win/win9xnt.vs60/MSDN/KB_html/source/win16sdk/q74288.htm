   versions 3.1 and 3.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In the Microsoft Windows graphical environment, when a dynamic-link
library (DLL) is implicitly linked to an application, the LibMain
function in the DLL should not call any dialog box, messaging, or
window management functions. Making such a call causes a FatalExit
error under the debugging version of Windows because the application
has not created a message queue when the LibMain function for an
implicitly loaded DLL executes.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Every Windows DLL must include an automatic initialization function,
which is typically called LibMain. Windows calls this function when
the DLL is initially loaded, giving the DLL an opportunity to perform
one-time startup processing.
<P>
This startup processing typically includes registering window classes,
initializing the DLL's local heap, and setting initial values for the
DLL's global variables. However, a DLL's LibMain function cannot
safely make many Windows calls.
<P>
When Windows loads an application that is implicitly linked to a DLL,
it also loads the DLL on behalf of the application. Windows loads the
DLL and calls the DLL's LibMain function before calling the
application's WinMain function and before creating the application's
message queue.
<P>
While the DLL is executing, it uses certain system resources that are
owned by the application. One of these resources is the application's
message queue. If the application's message queue has not been
created, the DLL cannot do any messaging or tasking (because these
operations require a message queue). In other words, the DLL cannot
call any Windows functions that would send a message or yield control
to another application. Attempting to do so causes a FatalExit error.
<P>
Because the DLL's LibMain function may be called before the
application's message queue is created, the LibMain function cannot do
any messaging or tasking. Such calls include the dialog box, messaging
and window management functions as well as other functions that could
result in a message being sent.
