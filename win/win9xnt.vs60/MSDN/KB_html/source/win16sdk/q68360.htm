<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Control Panel application does not respond to WM_WININICHANGE messages
under Windows. Microsoft considered including this functionality; however,
it was decided that, because the Control Panel changes various items in the
system configuration file (WIN.INI), responding to a WM_WININICHANGE
message could cause a conflict. (For example, if another application
changes the text color while the Control Panel has its color dialog
displayed, what is the proper action for the Control Panel?)
<P>
To work around this potential problem, the Control Panel reinitializes
itself each time a new dialog box is displayed. However, this
initialization does not involve querying the WIN.INI file with
GetProfileString().
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows caches the WIN.INI file. Therefore, if a regular text editor
(other than Notepad) is used to modify the file, the disk file is
updated, however, the cache is not.
<P>
When a WM_WININICHANGE message is broadcast to all top-level windows,
each application can check the WIN.INI cache for relevant changes.
However, applications will not look at the WIN.INI file on disk.
<P>
One way to update the cache is to exit Windows and restart. Another
way to update the cache is to call WriteProfileString(NULL,NULL,NULL),
which forces a flush of the cache. A subsequent call to
GetProfileString() will cause the WIN.INI file on disk to be read into
the cache.
<P>
However, the changes will not be reflected by the Control Panel unless
the user exits and re-enters Windows. Reflecting changes to WIN.INI in
the Control Panel without first exiting Windows is under consideration
for inclusion in a future release of Windows.
