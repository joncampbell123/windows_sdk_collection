<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
An advantage for pen computers would be the ability to add handwriting to a
text file. This process is known as annotation. An application that
implements full-scale annotation must address several issues, including
movement, saving ink to a file, delayed recognition, and using gestures.
One of the most basic issues is movement.
<P>
ANNOTATE is a file in the Software Library that demonstrates one
scrolling algorithm that scrolls the ink and the text file appropriately.
<P>
Download ANNOTATE.EXE, a self-extracting file, from the Microsoft Software
Library (MSL) on the following services:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Download Service (MSDL)
<P><PRE>      Dial (206) 936-6735 to connect to MSDL
      Download <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/annotate.exe">ANNOTATE.EXE</A> <I>(size: 28246 bytes)</I> 
</PRE>
<LI>Internet (anonymous FTP)
<P><PRE>      ftp ftp.microsoft.com
      Change to the \SOFTLIB\MSLFILES directory
      Get <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/annotate.exe">ANNOTATE.EXE</A> <I>(size: 28246 bytes)</I> 
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For an application to attach ink to a specified position of a text file, it
must scroll and repaint the ink in the appropriate position as the text
moves. The ANNOTATE sample application demonstrates one of many possible
scrolling algorithms. ANNOTATE also demonstrates dynamically changing ink
color and width.
<P>
ANNOTATE calls the RedisplayPenData function to redisplay the ink and the
DuplicatePenData function to save ink over the life of the application.
ANNOTATE can serve as a foundation for other pen-centric annotation
applications.
