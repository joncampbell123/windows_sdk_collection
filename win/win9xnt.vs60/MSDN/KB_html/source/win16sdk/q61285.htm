WINDOWS

<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.1 and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The global lock count mechanism has been changed in the Windows version 3.x
protected modes (that is, standard mode and enhanced mode). The GlobalLock
function only affects the lock count of discardable objects and the default
data segment (DGROUP); movable objects are not affected. Thus, repeated
calling of GlobalLock() and GlobalFlags() on a GMEM_MOVEABLE object does
not show any changes to its lock count.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following are reasons and explanations concerning this design change:

<OL><P><LI>In real mode, GlobalLock() fixes the segment:offset of a global memory
   object. It also increases the lock count, as reported by GlobalFlags().

<P><LI>In protected mode, the far pointer returned by GlobalLock() is a
   selector:offset, not a segment:offset. Because the selector value does
   not change, GlobalLock() does not actually fix the memory object in the
   physical address space. Thus, the GlobalLock function in protected mode
   does not change the lock count, unless the object is discardable or is a
   default data segment.
<P>
   In the case of a discardable object, the lock count is meaningful,
   because Windows needs to know when the object can be discarded
   (which is when its lock count is zero).

<P><LI>However, some applications have used the GlobalLock() lock count
   as a "reference count" [that is, as an indication of how many times
   GlobalLock() was called]. If the lock count for an object goes to zero,
   these applications might consider the object a candidate for being
   manually discarded, perhaps after copying the data to disk.
<P>
   Unfortunately, this use of GlobalLock() as a reference count keeper does
   not work in protected mode. Applications that symmetrically pair calls
   to GlobalLock() with calls to GlobalUnlock() do not need to know the
   lock count, and therefore, are unaffected by this change in behavior.

<P><LI>How does an application keep track of reference counts now, given
   that the GlobalLock() approach does not work for nondiscardable
   objects in protected mode? The application should really keep track
   of reference counts itself, which should not be hard to do because
   the application in need of this functionality will have a table of
   global handles anyway.
<P>
   However, if the application cannot be modified to maintain its own
   reference counts, then there is a new Windows function, called
   GlobalFix(), that will accomplish this functionality. GlobalFix()
   performs the following functionality:
<P>
   a. It fixes the object in the protected mode linear space.
<P>
   b. It increments the "lock count", as returned by the
<P><PRE>      GlobalFlags function.
</PRE>
<P><LI>The following includes more information about GlobalFlags(). In real
   mode, it returns the GlobalLock() lock count. In protected mode, if the
   object is discardable, GlobalFlags() also returns the GlobalLock() lock
   count. In protected mode, if the object is nondiscardable, GlobalFlags()
   returns the GlobalFix() reference count. In other words, GlobalFlags()
   always returns the lock/fix count. However, in protected mode, the
   GlobalLock() and GlobalUnLock() APIs do not affect the count, only the
   GlobalFix() and GlobalUnFix() APIs do.
<P>
   NOTE: In real mode, the GlobalFlags() lock count actually indicates
   the sum of GlobalLock()'s and GlobalFix()'es. Therefore, if the
   programmer is calling GlobalLock() and GlobalFix() in pairs,
   then the GlobalFlags() lock count actually is twice the logical
   reference count, if in real mode.

<P><LI>If the application needs to keep track of reference counts, and the
   programmer wants Windows to do the work for them, then the
   programmer must accompany every call to GlobalLock() with a call to
   GlobalFix(). This way the programmer will be able to depend on the
   validity of the GlobalFlag() lock/reference count. However, using the
   GlobalFix() API just to keep track of the reference count is overkill,
   if that is all the programmer wants it to do. Remember, GlobalFix()
   also fixes the object in the protected mode linear address space.
   The price the programmer pays for having Windows keep track of the
   reference count (by using the GlobalFix()) is the following:
<P>
   a. Every time the GlobalLock() or GlobalUnLock() API is called,
<P><PRE>      the programmer must also call either the GlobalFix() or
      GlobalUnFix().
</PRE><P>
   And, much worse:
<P>
   b. The programmer establishes sandbars in the linear address space.
<P>
   An application should either keep track of reference counts on its
   own or always pair GlobalLock() calls with matching GlobalUnlock()
   calls; the use of the GlobalFix() API should  be avoided.
<P>
   Very few applications should need to fix global objects in linear
   space; therefore, few applications should need to use the
   GlobalFix function.

<P><LI>If the programmer needs to unconditionally unlock and free a global
   memory object of any type, then code similar to the following can
   be used:
<P>
<PRE>        /* 1.  Make it discardable if necessary. */
        if (GlobalFlags shows that it is nondiscardable)
            GlobalRealloc (GMEM_MODIFY it to be discardable);

        /* 2. Remove any lock counts that might be on it. */
        while (GlobalUnlock != 0) /* keep unlocking it */
            ;

        /* 3. Free it. */
        GlobalFree()
