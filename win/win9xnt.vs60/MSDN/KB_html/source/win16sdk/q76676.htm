The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.0 and 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows creates two handles associated with each task running in the
system. One handle is the instance handle, hInstance, which is passed to
the WinMain function when the program starts execution. The other handle is
the task handle, hTask, which is returned by GetCurrentTask().
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The numerical values of hInstance and hTask are different. In some
routines, hTask can be used in place of hInstance without any problems. In
other routines, using hTask in place of hInstance causes incorrect behavior
and may result in unrecoverable application errors (UAEs). Using hTask in
place of hInstance is considered bad form and will probably cause problems
when the application is run under future versions of Windows.
<P>
To retrieve the instance handle for the application currently running,
use the following code fragment:
<P>
<PRE>   hInstance = GetWindowWord(GetActiveWindow(), GWW_HINSTANCE);

</PRE>To retrieve the task handle for the application currently running, use
the following code fragment:
<P>
<PRE>   hTask = GetCurrentTask();

</PRE>The instance handle, hInstance, is used to identify the data
associated with a particular instance of an application. The task
handle, hTask, is the handle to a structure, called the task database
(TDB), which contains information about the task (for example, its
queue, module handle, and so forth). The instance handle and the PDB
(program database), also known as the PSP (program segment prefix),
are also stored in the task database. The GetCurrentPDB() function
returns a handle to the current PDB.
<P>
Each instance of an application has both an instance handle and a task
handle. Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) are not tasks; therefore, they
have only an instance handle and do not have a task handle.
