   version 3.1

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In theory, it is possible to use more than four communications (COM) ports
in a Windows-based application. In practice, however, due to the limitation
imposed by the Windows 3.1 communications (comm) driver, only a maximum of
four communications ports can be used.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The virtual communications device (VCD) under Windows can support up to
nine communications ports. And, the Windows communications functions also
support the use of nine communications ports in a Windows-based
application. All this information might indicate that a maximum of nine COM
ports can be used in a Windows-based application.
<P>
But the communications driver (COMM.DRV) that is shipped with Windows
version 3.1 supports a maximum of only four communications ports. For
example, you can use the following code in a Windows-based application:
<P>
<PRE>   // Get the number of COM ports.
   nPorts = EscapeCommFunction(0,GETMAXCOM)+1;

</PRE>Note, nPorts is not an indication of the number of communications ports
that the computer has; it indicates the maximum number of communications
ports the communications driver supports. For the Windows version 3.1
standard communications driver, nPorts is always four.
<P>
This situation might change in the future. For example, the communications
driver that ships with Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 does support
more than four communications ports. Also, some of the third-party
communications drivers, such as TurboCom by Pacific CommWare, do support up
to nine communications ports. For more information, contact:

   Voice: (503) 482-2744
   Fax: (503) 482-2627
   BBS: (503) 482-2633

</PRE>Note that Microsoft does not recommend any third-party applications for a
given purpose. TurboCom is an example only.
<P>
Also, because the Windows Device Driver Kit (DDK) version 3.1 provides the
source code to all the drivers including the Windows standard
communications driver, one could modify the source code to provide support
for more than four communications ports under Windows. However, note that
modifying the communications driver source code is not a trivial operation.
For more information on how to modify the Windows communications driver
source code to provide support for nine communications ports, query the
