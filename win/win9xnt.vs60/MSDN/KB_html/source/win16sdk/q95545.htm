The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.1 and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
GlobalDosAlloc() is used by Windows-based applications and dynamic-link
libraries (DLLs) to allocate memory blocks that are guaranteed to
exist in the first megabyte (MB) of linear address space.
GlobalDosFree() is used to free memory blocks allocated by
GlobalDosAlloc(). Memory blocks allocated by GlobalDosAlloc() are
fixed in standard mode and page locked in 386 enhanced mode.
<P>
Neither of these functions is prototyped in the Microsoft Windows
version 3.0 Software Development Kit's WINDOWS.H; however, both are
correctly prototyped in the Microsoft Windows version 3.1 SDK's
WINDOWS.H. Furthermore, both functions are prototyped incorrectly in
the Windows 3.0 SDK "Reference, Volume 1" and in the Windows 3.1 SDK
"Programmer's Reference, Volume 2: Functions." The correct prototypes
are:
<P>
<PRE>   DWORD FAR PASCAL GlobalDosAlloc(DWORD cbAlloc);
   UINT FAR PASCAL GlobalDosFree (UINT uSelector);  // in Windows 3.1
   WORD FAR PASCAL GlobalDosFree (WORD wSelector);  // in Windows 3.0

</PRE>The return value of GlobalDosAlloc(), if successful, contains a
selector in the low-order word and a paragraph-aligned segment value
in the high-order word. If GlobalDosAlloc() fails, it returns zero. If
GlobalDosFree() succeeds, it returns zero. If it fails,
GlobalDosFree() returns the value of the selector passed to it.
<P>
Memory below 1 MB is scarce and should not be allocated by
applications or DLLs unless absolutely necessary. For further
information about how memory below 1 MB is used, query on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   GlobalDosAlloc() or memory

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following code sample demonstrates how to use GlobalDosAlloc() and
GlobalDosFree():
<P>
<PRE>   DWORD dwMyLowMemory;
   UINT  uMySegment;
   UINT  uMySelector;
   LPSTR lpProtModePtr;
   DWORD lpRealModePtr;
    .
    .
    .

   if ((dwMyLowMemory = GlobalDosAlloc(512)) == 0)
      return FALSE;    // Error: unable to allocate memory


   // GlobalDosAlloc() allocates global memory that can be accessed by
   // real-mode applications. The memory is guaranteed to exist in the
   // first megabyte of linear address space.
   //
   // GlobalDosAlloc() returns a DWORD in which the high-order word is a
   // paragraph segment and the low-order word is a selector.

   uMySegment  = HIWORD(dwMyLowMemory);
   uMySelector = LOWORD(dwMyLowMemory);

   lpProtModePtr = (LPSTR)MAKELONG(0, uMySelector);
                                               // protected mode pointer

   lpRealModePtr = (DWORD)MAKELONG(0, uMySegment);
                                               // real mode pointer
    .
    .
    .

   if ((uMySelector = GlobalDosFree(uMySelector)) != NULL)
      return FALSE;    // Error: unable to free memory

</PRE>This example works correctly in all Windows modes. The selector value
returned by GlobalDosAlloc() does not need to be locked via a call to
GlobalLock() because it is already locked. Because the value of
uMySegment is a paragraph-aligned segment value, the starting offset
of the memory object will be zero. In Windows 3.0 real mode,
GlobalDosAlloc() returns segment values in both words.
<P>
GlobalDosAlloc() allocates memory below 1 MB in linear address space. In
standard mode, this memory is in the first megabyte of physical memory
because linear addresses are the same as physical addresses. In 386
enhanced mode, however, linear addresses are not the same as physical
addresses. Memory allocated via GlobalDosAlloc() is not guaranteed to
reside in the first megabyte of physical memory nor to be physically
contiguous. Furthermore, because the physical address of a memory
block allocated via GlobalDosAlloc() is not known in 386 enhanced mode,
it is not suitable for DMA transfers or memory-mapped hardware.
<P>
In 386 enhanced mode Windows, GlobalDosAlloc() allocates memory blocks
in the Windows virtual machine only. Terminate-and-stay-resident
programs (TSRs) and MS-DOS device drivers that were started before
Windows are global to all virtual machines and thus can use these
memory blocks. However, TSRs and MS-DOS-based applications that are started
in Windows MS-DOS boxes run in their own virtual machines and so cannot
see the memory allocated by GlobalDosAlloc(). Because memory allocated
by GlobalDosAlloc() is not global to all virtual machines, it cannot
be used to communicate asynchronously (based on hardware interrupts,
for example) with TSRs. For examples of Windows-based applications that
communicate with TSRs, study the GDOSMEM and TDOSMEM sample
applications included in the Windows 3.1 SDK, or query on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   GDOSMEM or TDOSMEM

</PRE>If GlobalDosAlloc() is called from within a DLL, the allocated memory
block is owned by the application instance that called the DLL, not
the DLL. However, it is sometimes necessary for a DLL to own a block
of memory that MS-DOS can access. (For example, a DLL may need its own
buffer to communicate with a TSR.)
<P>
Because GlobalDosAlloc() doesn't take a parameter to specify the
attributes of the memory block to be allocated as GlobalAlloc does,
how can the memory be assigned to a DLL? The DLL can allocate the
memory on behalf of the calling application instance and then call
GlobalReAlloc() to change the ownership of the memory block to itself.
The following code sample demonstrates this technique:
<P>
<PRE>   // Called from within a DLL

   HGLOBAL hMyLowMem;
   DWORD   dwMyLowMemory;
   UINT    uSelector;
   LPSTR   lpszProtModePtr;
    .
    .
    .
   if ((dwMyLowMemory = GlobalDosAlloc (512)) == 0)
      return (FALSE);      // Error: unable to allocate memory

   uSelector = LOWORD(dwMyLowMemory);
   lpszProtModePtr = (LPSTR)MAKELONG(0, uSelector);

   hMyLowMem = LOWORD(GlobalHandle (uSelector));

   hMyLowMem = GlobalReAlloc (hMyLowMem, 0, GMEM_MODIFY |
                                            GMEM_DDESHARE);
    .
    .
    .

</PRE>After the call to GlobalReAlloc(), the memory block will belong to the
DLL and can be accessed by lpszProtModePtr. To free the memory block,
just call GlobalDosFree(); there is no need to change the ownership of
the block back to its original owner.
<P>
GlobalDosAlloc() and GlobalDosFree() are not the same as the DPMI DOS
Memory Management Services (functions 100h to 102h). Windows
applications and DLLs should not use these DPMI functions because
GlobalDosAlloc() and GlobalDosFree() perform the same functions.
<P>
Important note: Applications and DLLs should not use GlobalDosAlloc()
unless absolutely necessary because the free memory pool below 1 MB
from which it allocates is a scarce system resource.
<P>
GlobalDosAlloc() and GlobalDosFree() are documented on pages 4-236 and
4- 237 of the Microsoft Windows SDK 3.0 "Reference, Volume 1" and on
pages 501 and 502 of the Microsoft Windows SDK 3.1 "Programmer's
Reference, Volume 2: Functions."
