<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Support for real mode has been removed from Windows 3.1. Many applications
designed for Windows 3.0 do not support real mode. The reasons behind this
trend toward protected mode include superior memory management and smaller,
faster application code.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The remainder of this article lists the advantages and disadvantages of
removing support for real mode from applications.
<P>
<P><h3>Advantages of Removing Real Mode Support</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Protected mode code is smaller, cleaner, and more maintainable.
   These factors lead to a faster, more responsive, more reliable,
   system. Code is smaller and cleaner for the following reasons:
<P>
   a. The 286 and higher processors can track memory locations in
<P><PRE>      hardware, which makes locking and unlocking memory objects
      unnecessary. An object can be locked once when it is allocated
      and unlocked just prior to being freed. Because the object can
      move in memory even when it is locked, it is not necessary to
      bracket each access to an object with lock and unlock calls.
</PRE><P>
   b. Far functions can use simplified function prolog and epilog
<P><PRE>      code. For more information on this aspect of protected mode,
      query on the following words:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         prod(winsdk) and protected and streamlined

   c. Because protected mode code is restricted to running on 286 and
      higher processors, the Microsoft C Compiler -G2 switch can be
      used to generate smaller and faster application code.

</PRE><P><LI>Protected mode (both standard and enhanced mode) breaks the "640K
   barrier." Furthermore, under enhanced mode, Windows uses paged
   virtual memory to expand available memory by using the system hard
   disk as a swapping device. The large address space allows
   applications to have more code and data and allows users to run
   more applications.

<P><LI>Testing is easier because there are fewer Windows modes to test. To
   fully test a product that runs under real mode, five separate modes
   must be tested. Real mode itself contributes three of those modes:
   real mode with no expanded memory, real mode using the small-frame
   Expanded Memory Specification (EMS) and real mode using the large-
   frame EMS. The other two modes are standard mode and enhanced mode.
   Because support for real mode has been eliminated, the same amount
   of testing effort can concentrate on producing a better product. It
   also provides an opportunity to develop and test additional
   enhancements. For more information on EMS, query on the following
   words:
<P>
<P><PRE>      prod(winsdk) and ems and developers
</PRE>
<P><LI>Based on a survey of Windows developers, most developers are
   targeting only protected mode because Windows performance on 8086-
   based and 8088-based machines is not satisfactory. Furthermore,
   these machines cannot address more than 640K of RAM.

<P><LI>"Wild writes," write-accesses to memory that incorrectly modify a
   memory location, can frequently be detected in protected mode
   through the mechanism of a GP-fault (an unrecoverable application
   error). It is not possible to detect these errors under real mode.
   These GP-faults provide information about application bugs before
   the application is released.
<P>
</OL>For the reasons mentioned above, Microsoft is removing support for real
mode from Windows 3.1. For these same reasons, many developers have also
removed support for real mode from applications developed for Windows 3.0.
Applications that are written to support only protected mode should be
marked with the Resource Compiler's -T switch to prevent the application
from loading in real mode.
<P>
Removing support for real mode also benefits the end user because
applications run faster and are more reliable. While small applications run
quickly in real mode, larger applications run slowly. However, in protected
mode, large applications also run quickly. A collection of large and small
applications can be run simultaneously without any loss in speed. For
example, when more applications are running simultaneously than can fit in
the physical memory installed in the system, the paging mechanism (only
available in enhanced mode) intelligently manages virtual memory to keep
the most-frequently used memory pages in physical memory. This management
speeds up the system.
<P>
<P><h3>Disadvantages of Removing Real Mode Support</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>The installed base of 8088-based and 8086-based machines cannot
   use the software.

<P><LI>Code that performs segment arithmetic cannot be used in protected
   mode. Therefore, some drivers and MS-DOS programs that run in real
   mode must be rewritten for protected mode, or they cannot be run
   under Windows 3.1.
