<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) documentation regarding
dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) is not very detailed with regard to some
facets of developing DLLs. In this article, some of the lesser known
considerations for developing DLLs are discussed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The primary reason for using a DATA NONE DLL is to ensure that the data
segment (DS) is equal to the stack segment (SS). Many of the functions
provided with the Microsoft C run-time libraries expect that DS == SS.
Functions with this property have been removed from the Windows SDK DLL
libraries. In DATA SINGLE DLLs, the DLL will use the application's SS, but
the DLL will have its own DS. DS is then not equal to SS and the C run-time
functions (or other functions expecting DS == SS) may not be used. In DATA
NONE DLLs, however, the DLL uses the application's DS and SS. In
applications, DS == SS; therefore, for a DATA NONE DLL, DS == SS.
<P>
While this may sound like a straightforward process, there are some
items declared within a DLL that can create a data segment. Windows
looks at a flag to determine if the DLL has a data segment. If DATA
NONE has been declared, Windows will treat that DLL as a DATA NONE DLL
whether a data segment exists or not. However, the Windows loader uses
information from the linker to determine what segments to load, not
how the flags are set. Therefore, data segments that do exist are
loaded into memory.
<P>
When additional data segments are created, because the compiler works
under the assumption that DS == SS, the data segments that are loaded
are not used and waste memory.
<P>
When a DATA NONE DLL does have a data segment, Windows will use the
application's DS as it should, but the offset into the data segment is
the offset into the DLL's data segment. Writing to any variable
declared in the DLL will overwrite data in the application's data
segment.
<P>
This type of bug is often difficult to track down. When the data
segment is built for the DLL, items are placed in the data segment
from bottom to top. So an integer variable will take up 2 bytes on the
bottom of the DLL's data segment. Writing to this variable will
overwrite 2 bytes at the bottom of the calling application's data
segment. An application's data segment normally contains thousands of
bytes; therefore, this type of error may go unnoticed and will not
cause a GP-fault.
<P>
Global variables, static variables, and static text (string literals
such as "Hello") declared in the DLL will create new data segments for
the DATA NONE DLL.
<P>
The warning message "RC: Warning RW4002: Non-discardable Segment 2 set
to PRELOAD" is quite common when DLLs are processed by the Resource
Compiler. However, it is not immediately obvious from the text of the
message why this is a problem. This warning is generated when a data
segment has been created but flags have not been defined for that
segment (such as NONE, PRELOAD, or SINGLE). The default setting for
these segments is PRELOAD SINGLE.
<P>
After ruling out all the obvious ways that a new data segment can be
created, it is time to look deeper into the heart of the code.
<P>
If the DLL uses the Microsoft C run-time code, a global internal
variable is used by the library. This variable is referenced in
LIBENTRY.ASM by the following code:
<P>
<PRE>   extern __acrtused:abs

</PRE>The __acrtused variable informs the linker that the C run-time code will be
used in the DLL. If the C run-time code is not used in the DLL, this
variable may be removed to create a true DATA NONE DLL. This is done by
replacing the C run-time libraries (SDLLCEW, MDLLCEW, and LDLLCEW) with the
appropriate libraries without the C run-time code (SNOCRTD, MNOCRTD, and
LNOCRTD, respectively). Along with these libraries, the /NOE option must
also be used. For more information on eliminating the C Run-time startup
code, refer to Section 14.5.10.1 in the "Guide to Programming" manual of
the Windows Software Development Kit version 3.1.
<P>
If the C run-time is used by the DLL, this variable must be declared
and using the DATA SINGLE declaration is encouraged. Declaring
__acrtused creates a data segment. However, the warning that occurs
when this is done in a DATA NONE DLL may often be ignored.
<P>
DATA SINGLE is also encouraged when the DLL contains literal strings.
