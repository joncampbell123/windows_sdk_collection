</PRE>Comments:
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>TrueType</h2>
 
<P>
___Pass ___Fail Examine your application code and be sure there are no
<PRE>                dependencies on the font names Helv and Tms Rmn.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail Enable the "Show Only TrueType Fonts in Applications"
<PRE>                option in Control Panel. Check the font dialogs in
                your application. They should list all TrueType fonts
                and no non-TrueType fonts.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail Check fonts in dialog boxes, tool bars, and sample
<PRE>                files for your application. Be sure they are readable.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail Check the application code and be sure there are no
<PRE>                dependencies on GetTextFace and EnumFonts matching.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail Create a document in your application that contains
<PRE>                characters close to the edge of the screen and the
                printable margins. Scroll the document, checking for
                characters (or pieces of characters) left behind.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail Highlight text. Be sure the highlight encompasses all
<PRE>                characters and that no part of any character
                (especially the first and last characters) is left
                out.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail Print the document. Be sure no characters are clipped
<PRE>                at the edges of the printable region.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail Create a document under Windows version 3.0a using
<PRE>                type-manager (such as ATM), bitmap, and device fonts.
                Look at the document under Windows version 3.1; be
                sure the screen appears the same.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail Print the document under Windows versions 3.0a and
<PRE>                3.1; be sure the output appears the same.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail If your application assumed that scalable fonts could
<PRE>                not print on nonscalable devices, such as a PCL
                printer, it will have problems in enumerating fonts.
                Check the font dialog box and sizes listed for TrueType
                fonts. The font dialog box should list many sizes for each
                TrueType font.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail TrueType fonts are shipped in regular, bold, italic,
<PRE>                and bold italic. This can cause problems for
                applications that assumed styles were always
                simulated. Check the font dialog box to ensure that each
                font is listed only once.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail TrueType fonts appear for both printer and screen.
<PRE>                This causes problems for applications that assume
                printer and screen fonts are always different. Select
                a nonraster printer (for example, PCL) and check the
                font dialog box to ensure that each font is listed only
                once.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail Create a document with a nonscalable printer
<PRE>                installed, using two fonts, a device font, and a
                TrueType font. Both fonts must have the same name.
                Print the document.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail Use a TrueType font to create a document using the
<PRE>                desktop publishing and international characters. Be
                sure the characters appear correctly on the screen.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail Change to a bitmap font, and then change back to a
<PRE>                TrueType font. Be sure the characters still appear
                correctly.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail Print the document. Be sure the printout is correct.
<P>
___Pass ___Fail Using the Char Map application in the accessories
<PRE>                group of Program Manager, use a TrueType font to copy
                the desktop publishing characters to the clipboard and
                paste them into your application. Be sure the
                characters appear correctly.

                problems, set the SYSTEM.INI setting TrapTimerPorts
                and try the tests again.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail Check the VDD by starting your application or TSR in
<PRE>                one or more virtual machines and then switch between
                virtual machines watching for problems with the

<P><h3>Checklist of Problem Areas Not Specific to Windows 3.1 Changes</h3>
 
<P>
Following are some areas that you should check, but that were not
changes for Windows version 3.1. We have seen several applications
with problems in these areas.
<P>
<P><h2>Setup</h2>
 
<P>
___Pass ___Fail Try your setup program with SHARE enabled and not
<PRE>                enabled. Be sure your setup program runs correctly in
                both cases.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail Install Windows version 3.1 over Windows version 3.0,
<PRE>                but in a directory other than the one containing
                Windows version 3.0. Be sure your application runs
                under Windows version 3.1 without being reinstalled.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail Try your setup program with a path that is at the
<PRE>                maximum length. Be sure your setup program recognizes
                that it cannot add to the path.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail Try your setup program with an AUTOEXEC.BAT file
<PRE>                containing more than one path statement, or by calling
                batch files that set the path. Be sure your setup
                program recognizes the correct path statement to which
                to add information.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail Try your setup program with a screen saver running.
<P>
___Pass ___Fail Install your application on a hardcard drive and on a
<PRE>                compressed drive. Be sure the application installs and
                runs correctly.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail Install your application on a hard drive with a drive
<PRE>                letter greater than E:. Be sure your application
                installs and runs correctly.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail If your application can be installed on a network,
<PRE>                install it on as many networks as possible.

</PRE>Comments:
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>General Operations</h2>
 
<P>
___Pass ___Fail Load a large file, and resize the application window
<PRE>                so that scrolling is necessary horizontally and
                vertically. Scroll and ensure that repainting is
                correct.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail Exit Windows while your application is still running
<PRE>                but has unsaved files. Be sure you are prompted to
                save the unsaved files before Windows exits.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail Run your application with SHARE enabled and not
<PRE>                enabled. Be sure it runs correctly.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail If your application adds anything to AUTOEXEC.BAT that
<PRE>                uses environment space, be sure the application works
                or dies gracefully if the machine is out of
                environment space.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail Have the default printer in the Control Panel
<PRE>                different from the printer selected in your
                application, and print a document. Be sure your
                application prints correctly or that it warns the user
                of the condition.

</PRE>___Pass ___Fail Create a directory using character ASCII 129
<PRE>                (ALT+129). Using your application's File Open or File
                Save commands, change to this directory.
