<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When enhanced mode Windows is running, the WIN386 module answers all
extended memory specification (XMS) calls. The standard mode MS-DOS
Extender (DOSX) answers all calls only in protected mode.
<P>
The standard mode task swapper answers memory allocation calls to
arbitrate the use of extended memory between Windows and MS-DOS
applications, and to facilitate task swapping.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows enhanced mode provides its own XMS services, without regard to
the XMS driver that was installed before Windows started up. The
amount of XMS memory available in an MS-DOS window under enhanced mode
is determined by the PIF (program information file) settings, and not
by the amount of memory actually available in the system. The enhanced
mode XMS driver returns failure for all XMS Lock Region calls, because
enhanced mode XMS uses virtual memory rather than physical memory.
<P>
In standard mode, the task swapper hooks the XMS driver, allowing it
to arbitrate XMS use between Windows-based and MS-DOS-based applications.
Most XMS calls are passed through to the original XMS driver. However,
calls that manage extended memory are affected by the PIF settings. Because
it hooks the XMS driver, the standard mode task swapper can use
extended memory allocated to Windows, but not currently in use, for
swapping. This feature is disabled if a "limulator"
[Lotus/Intel/Microsoft (LIM) standard expanded memory system driver]
is present.
<P>
The standard mode MS-DOS extender hooks XMS detection in protected
mode. The INT 2Fh call that retrieves the address of the XMS driver's
control function (AX=4310h) returns a protected mode address that an
application can call to perform XMS control functions. This is
intended for the use by application installation programs that must
determine the version number of an installed XMS driver. Applications
in the Windows environment are discouraged from making other XMS calls
in protected mode. In particular, attempting to lock XMS memory in
standard mode may result in a page fault or fatal system crash.
