The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows,
   version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Using EnableCommNotification() to enable WM_COMMNOTIFY messages for
CN_RECEIVE or CN_TRANSMIT events can cause spurious WM_COMMNOTIFY messages.
At higher baud rates, this problem can cause a system to crash and reboot.
<P>
WM_COMMNOTIFY messages are received with a 0 (zero) value for the
NotifyStatus parameter. The system crashes and reboots while receiving or
transmitting data.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If the application is experiencing these symptoms, possible solutions are:

<UL><LI>Extra WM_COMMNOTIFY messages with NotifyStatus=0 can be ignored.

<LI>If the system is crashing, change the application to NOT enable
   CN_RECEIVE and CN_TRANSMIT events.

<LI>Enable the CN_EVENT notification for the EV_RXCHAR event by calling
   SetCommEventMask() then EnableCommNotification(). EV_RXCHAR is
   generated when any character is received and put into the queue. Make
   sure that EnableCommNotification() is called with -1 in both the
   cbWriteNotify and cbOutQueue parameters, such that the CN_RECEIVE and
   CN_TRANSMIT events are not enabled. This method is demonstrated in the
   TTY sample in the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK).

<LI>Instead of using EnableCommNotification, the application could poll
   for data. This could be implemented in the message loop of the
   application, or using a timer.

<LI>Modify COMM.DRV to work around this problem.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This problem has been reported as a bug. There will not be a fix for
COMM.DRV in Windows version 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
CN_RECEIVE events are generated when the number of bytes in the receive
queue exceeds the threshold (cbWriteNotify) set in EnableCommNotification()
or when a time-out occurs. After a CN_RECEIVE has been generated for
exceeding the cbWriteNotify threshold, another CN_RECEIVE should not be
generated until the number of bytes drops below cbWriteNotify then exceeds
it again.
<P>
CN_TRANSMIT events are generated similarly to CN_RECEIVE. The notification
threshold of the output queue is set in the cbOutQueue parameter of
EnableCommNotify. If the number of bytes in the output queue drops below
cbOutQueue, a CN_TRANSMIT should be generated. A new CN_TRANSMIT should not
be generated until the output queue exceeds, then drops below cbOutQueue
again.
<P>
However, if interrupts arrive fast enough, extra "threshold" CN_RECEIVEs
(or, similarly, CN_TRANSMITs) may be generated before the size of the
output queue drops below then again exceeds cbWriteNotify. These extra
events can be ignored; however, this characteristic may cause the system to
reboot, especially at higher baud rates.
