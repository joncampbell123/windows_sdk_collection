<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.0 and 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An application is able to change printer settings such as paper
orientation without requiring user intervention, but the same method does
not work to change the print quality of text from letter quality (LQ) or
near letter quality (NLQ) to draft. The ExtDeviceMode() function is used to
attempt this change through the dmPrintQuality member of the DEVMODE
structure.
<P>
Please see the MORE INFORMATION section below for details about how the
dmPrintQuality member of the DEVMODE structure, the DRAFTMODE printer
escape, and the selection in the Print Quality combobox in the Print
Options dialog, affect the "draft" mode or "quality" of printed output.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is a limitation of the standard DEVMODE structure. There is no
programmable way to change the text print quality (from LQ/NLQ to draft or
vice versa) without user intervention because it is not in the standard
DEVMODE structure.
<P>
With printer drivers that offer a Letter Quality/Draft option, such as
most Unidrv-based dot-matrix printer drivers, the user can change the
text print quality from the Printers applet in Control Panel as follows:

<UL><LI>select the printer
<LI>choose Setup
<LI>choose Options
<LI>choose Letter Quality or Draft from the Print Quality combo box
<P>
</UL>An application can allow the user to change this in the same manner by
using the DM_PROMPT (or DM_IN_PROMPT) flag for the fwMode parameter of
ExtDeviceMode(). This will bring up the Print Setup dialog box and the
user can then choose Options and then select the desired print quality.
<P>
An exception to this is the IBM Proprinter Unidrv-based printer drivers.
The Proprinters are dot-matrix printers but they do not provide a print
quality choice through the Print Options dialog. Please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base for information about selecting a
draft font with a Proprinter driver:

   TITLE     : SAMPLE: Using ExtDeviceMode() to Modify Printer Settings

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This feature is under consideration for a future release of Microsoft
Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are three types of "draft" settings that affect the appearance or
"quality" of printed output. They are not clearly explained in the SDK
documentation:
<P>
<P><h3>dmPrintQuality</h3>
 
<P>
dmPrintQuality controls the graphics resolution only. If the application
sets draft mode by setting the dmPrintQuality member of the DEVMODE
structure to DMRES_DRAFT, it means the driver should print graphics in the
lowest possible resolution for that device. For example, a laser printer
that offers the choice of 300, 150, or 75 dpi resolution will be set to 75
dpi. A dot-matrix printer that supports 240x144, 120x144, and 120x72 dpi
will be set to 120x72 dpi. Text is not affected by this setting, unless the
text is printed as graphics.
<P>
<P><h3>DRAFTMODE</h3>
 
<P>
If the application sets draft mode by calling the DRAFTMODE printer escape,
it means the driver should print text only. It will not print graphics.
<P>
<P><h3>Print Quality</h3>
 
<P>
If the user selects Draft from the Print Quality list in the Print Options
dialog as discussed in this article, then the driver will tell the printer
to print text in draft mode. Graphics are not affected by this setting.
