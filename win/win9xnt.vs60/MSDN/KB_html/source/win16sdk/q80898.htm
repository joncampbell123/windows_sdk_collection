<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Application Compatibility Document for Windows 3.1</h3>
 
<P>
Due to the amount of information in this document, it has been broken
into seven pieces. To find all seven pieces of this document and the
Windows 3.1 Compatibility Test checklist, query this knowledge base on
the words:
<P>
<PRE>   prod(winsdk) and 31compattest


</PRE><h3>PAINTING</h3>
 
<P>
In Windows version 3.1, Window management is substantially optimized
to avoid unnecessary redrawing and flashing. Applications that depend
in subtle ways on when (and if) WM_NCPAINT, WM_ERASEBKGND, and
WM_PAINT messages are sent may have incompatibilities. Windows version
3.0 frequently sent these messages redundantly to windows and
sometimes sent them to invisible windows. One of the most apparent
visual results of these optimizations is that a window's nonclient
area is not always repainted completely when a window is sized or
moved. Some attempt has been made to ensure compatibility, but some
differences still cannot be backward compatible and achieve the
significant performance and visual advantages.
<P>
In a Windows version 3.0 application, sending the WM_SETREDRAW message
with wParam set to FALSE to a window that had an update area does not
validate the window. The update area is still present after a
WM_SETREDRAW message with wParam set to TRUE. In a Windows version 3.1
application, WM_SETREDRAW with wParam set to FALSE validates the
window completely to ensure that the window does not receive any
WM_PAINT messages while it is invisible. This does not apply to edit
controls, list boxes, and combo boxes because their WM_SETREDRAW
messages are handled in a special-case manner.
<P>
<P><h3>Potential Problem</h3>
 
<P>
Any Windows version 3.0 application whose version number is changed to
3.1 may encounter problems if it depends on retaining the update area
after a WM_SETREDRAW message.
<P>
In a Windows version 3.0 application, when InvalidateRect or
InvalidateRgn is called with NULL to invalidate the entire window, all
child windows are also completely invalidated -- regardless of whether
the child window is outside the parent's client area (that is,
invisible). This results in WM_PAINT messages being sent to windows
that don't require them. In a Windows version 3.1 application, only
windows that are actually visible within a parent's client area
receive update regions and therefore WM_PAINT messages.
<P>
<P><h3>Potential Problem</h3>
 
<P>
Any Windows version 3.0 application whose version number is changed to
3.1 may encounter problems if it depends on its child windows
receiving WM_PAINT messages even when invisible.
<P>
In a Windows version 3.0 application, Windows sends a WM_SETVISIBLE
message immediately after sending the WM_SHOWWINDOW message. In a
Windows version 3.1 application, Windows does not send the
WM_SETVISIBLE message -- WM_SETVISIBLE is obsolete for Windows version
3.1.
<P>
<P><h3>Potential Problem</h3>
 
<P>
Any Windows version 3.0 application whose version number is changed to
3.1 may encounter problems if it depends on receiving the
WM_SETVISIBLE message.
<P>
In a Windows version 3.0 application, if BeginPaint is called on a
window that has a class icon, the function returns a window DC. This
is different from the GetDC function that returns a client DC with no
visible region. In a Windows version 3.1 application, BeginPaint and
GetDC both return a client DC with no visible region.
<P>
<P><h3>Potential Problem</h3>
 
<P>
Any Windows version 3.0 application whose version number is changed to
3.1 may encounter problems if it depends on receiving a window DC from
BeginPaint.
<P>
If a Windows version 3.0 application responds with FALSE to a
WM_ERASEBKGND message sent during any operation other than BeginPaint
(such as SetWindowPos), another WM_ERASEBKGND message is sent when the
application calls BeginPaint. If a Windows version 3.1 application
responds with FALSE, no second WM_ERASEBKGND message is sent, but
BeginPaint sets the fErase member of the PAINTSTRUCT structure to
TRUE.
<P>
<P><h3>Potential Problem</h3>
 
<P>
Any Windows version 3.0 application whose version number is changed to
3.1 may encounter problems if it does not check the fErase member
after calling BeginPaint.
<P>
In Windows version 3.0, the various controls call the UpdateWindow
function at inappropriate times, such as on receiving a WM_SETFOCUS
message, and at other times when changing the internal state. This
often leads to strange looking displays, because controls draw all or
part of themselves at odd times. In Windows version 3.1, the controls
do not call UpdateWindow as often, which speeds up and improves the
appearance of window repainting.
<P>
<P><h3>Potential Problem</h3>
 
<P>
Some controls may not get redrawn properly if they are moved or hidden
before they get a chance to process a WM_PAINT message.
<P>
<P><h3>Tests</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Minimize your application, and start another application. Restore
   your application. Be sure it paints correctly.

<P><LI>Start your application with another Windows-based application, such as
   one of the accessories. Bring the other application to the foreground,
   covering your application. Switch back to your application. Be sure it
   painted correctly.

<P><LI>Start several applications. Use ALT+TAB to switch between them. Be
   sure your application repaints correctly.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h3>SCROLLING</h3>
 
<P>
In a Windows version 3.0 application, the ScrollWindow function has a
number of bugs associated with scrolling a window that had any invalid
area. Frequently, the update region that results after the scrolling
operation is not properly calculated. In a Windows version 3.1
application, ScrollWindow calculates the update region correctly.
<P>
<P><h3>Potential Problem</h3>
 
<P>
Any Windows version 3.0 application whose version number is changed to
3.1 may encounter problems if it works around the Windows version 3.0
bugs.
<P>
<P><h3>Test</h3>
 
<P>
Run your application and try a variety of scrolling operations.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>MULTIPLE-DOCUMENT INTERFACE (MDI)</h3>
 
<P>
For Windows 3.0 applications, MDI is completely compatible with
Windows 3.0. For Windows 3.1 applications, MDI has been enhanced. In
particular, specifying the low-order style bit (MDIS_ALLCHILDSTYLES)
when creating an MDICLIENT window enables the new Windows 3.1 MDI
capabilities for that window. This gives applications control over all
MDI child window styles and allows for hidden windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Potential Problem</h3>
 
<P>
Any Windows 3.0 application whose version number is changed to 3.1 may
encounter problems if it unintentionally sets the low-order style bit
when creating an MDICLIENT window.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>WINDOWS HOOKS</h3>
 
<P>
In Windows version 3.0, three hook functions are available:
SetWindowsHook, UnhookWindowsHook, and DefHookProc. In Windows version
3.1, three more-powerful functions replace these functions:
SetWindowsHookEx, UnhookWindowsHookEx, and CallNextHookEx. Microsoft
strongly recommends that a Windows version 3.1 application use the new
functions. The old functions are still supported for backward
compatibility.
<P>
In Windows version 3.0, an application or a DLL that installs a hook
must maintain the hook chain. In Windows version 3.1, Windows
maintains the hook chains. As a result, subtle changes in the
interface may affect Windows version 3.0 applications. Furthermore,
Windows version 3.1 no longer allows applications and DLLs to
enumerate all the functions in a hook chain. In particular, Windows
version 3.1 no longer supports the HC_GETLPLPFN, HC_LPLPFNNEXT, and
HC_LPFNNEXT values for the DefHookProc function.
<P>
In Windows version 3.0, SetWindowsHook returns a pointer to the next
hook function. In Windows version 3.1, SetWindowsHook does not return
a pointer; instead, it returns a 32-bit value that identifies the next
hook function.
<P>
<P><h3>Potential Problem</h3>
 
<P>
An application that attempts to call the next hook function by using
the return value from SetWindowsHook as a function address will cause
a GP fault.
<P>
In Windows version 3.0, Windows passes negative hook values to hook
functions when unhooking a hook. These negative values are for Windows
internal use only. In Windows version 3.1, Windows does not pass
negative hook values to hook functions; it uses another method to
unhook a hook.
<P>
<P><h3>Potential Problem</h3>
 
<P>
An application's hook function fails if it depends on receiving
negative hook codes to carry out specific tasks.
<P>
A Windows version 3.0 application can unhook a hook function by
passing the address of the next hook function to the SetWindowsHook
function. In Windows version 3.1, passing the address of the next hook
function causes a RIP in the Windows version 3.1 debugging version. In
Windows version 3.0, SetWindowsHook never fails and so never returns
an error value. In Windows version 3.1, SetWindowsHook can fail, and
when it does so, it returns the error value -1L.
