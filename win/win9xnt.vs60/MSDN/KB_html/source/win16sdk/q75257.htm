<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
MS-DOS file handles are associated with a PSP (program segment prefix).
For an MS-DOS terminate-and-stay-resident program (TSR) to open and
operate on files on behalf of a Windows-based application, or to share file
handles between MS-DOS TSRs and Windows-based applications, the TSR and
application must be operating with the same PSP. This is possible
because every Windows-based application has an MS-DOS PSP. Therefore, it is
simply a matter of ensuring that the Windows-based application's PSP is the
current PSP when the MS-DOS TSR opens or operates on a file. This
article discusses some of the details involved with this process.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows Kernel creates a unique MS-DOS PSP for every Windows-based
application that is started. The only time that the application's PSP
must be selected as the current PSP is when the application calls
MS-DOS. Therefore, an application cannot assume that its PSP is the
current PSP. Listed below are two ways to have the PSP set so that a
TSR can open or operate on a file on the application's behalf:

<OL><P><LI>The Windows-based application performs an MS-DOS call just prior to
   calling the TSR. This MS-DOS call must involve the file system; just
   retrieving the time of day is not enough. One good choice might be
   Get File Attributes (INT 21h, function 43h). Another possibility is
   to open a file. As long as the application does not yield [by
   calling the GetMessage, SendMessage, PeekMessage, and so
   forth functions], the Kernel will set the PSP for the MS-DOS call
   and will not change it. At this point, the application can call the
   TSR secure in the knowledge that the PSP is set correctly.

<P><LI>The TSR can set the current PSP using INT 21h, function 50h (the BX
   register is the segment of the new PSP). To do this, it is
   necessary that either the Windows-based application or the TSR determine
   the PSP for the application.
<P>
   The TSR can determine the correct PSP by following these three
   steps:
<P>
   a. Have the application perform an MS-DOS call just prior to the first
<P><PRE>      call to the TSR.
</PRE><P>
   b. Determine the identity of the PSP by calling INT 21h, function
<P><PRE>      51h (the segment of the current PSP is returned in the BX
      register).
</PRE><P>
   c. Save this information or return it to the application that will
<P><PRE>      use the PSP as a parameter in subsequent calls to the TSR.
</PRE><P>
   The application can determine the PSP segment by following these
   three steps:
<P>
   a. Call the GetCurrentPDB function to determine its Program Data
<P><PRE>      Base (PDB). The PDB is the Windows equivalent of the PSP.
</PRE><P>
   b. In protected mode, the value returned is a selector. The
<P><PRE>      application must determine the segment address to which the
      selector maps by using the GetSelectorBase function.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Note that the GetSelectorBase function is not documented in the
      Windows Software Development Kit (SDK); however, the function is
      documented in the Windows Device Development Kit (DDK). The
      function returns a LONG which is the linear address of the base.
      Dividing this value by 16 yields a segment value. Because PDBs
      are allocated using the GlobalDOSAlloc function, the linear
      address is always below 1 megabyte.
</PRE><P>
   c. Once the Windows-based application has determined its PSP, specify
<P><PRE>      the PSP as a parameter when calling the TSR.
</PRE><P>
</OL>In Windows version 3.1, an installable driver mechanism has been
added that allows for essentially a Windows TSR. An installable driver
can be loaded at boot time or on demand by an application. It receives
notifications in real and standard mode when the user switches away from
or back to Windows to allow the driver to perform clean-up and/or
re-initialization operations as necessary. In all other respects, it is
a standard DLL.
