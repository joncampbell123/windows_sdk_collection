The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows
   versions 3.0 and 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
There are three different types of libraries used in Windows. These
three types of libraries are defined as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Object libraries are produced by LIB.EXE, and consist of Intel
   object code; for example, SWLIBC.LIB (the W implies the objects
   were compiled using Windows prolog conventions).
<P>
   Object libraries, which are sometimes more accurately called static
   link libraries, are the libraries that contain object code. These
   libraries are used at link time to resolve statically linked calls.

<P><LI>DLLs (Dynamic-Link Libraries) are produced by IMPLIB.EXE and
   LIB.EXE, and contain dynamic-link records derived from GDI.DEF,
   USER.DEF, and KERNEL.DEF. They also contain the Windows startup
   routine, WINSTART.OBJ, and any routines necessary to override C
   run-time functions (for example, calloc and malloc); that is,
   Windows-specific run-time functions.
<P>
   NOTE: The term Dynamic-Link Library or DLL is usually used to
   describe the actual Windows executable that implements a particular
   API.
<P>
   The term import library is usually used to describe the product of
   the IMPLIB utility. This library is used to resolve references to
   DLL exports at the time the application is linked.

<P><LI>Executable libraries are produced by the Microsoft linker program
   (LINK.EXE), and use the keyword LIBRARY in the .DEF file. They contain
   sharable Windows code, for example, GDI.EXE, USER.EXE, or KERNEL.EXE.
