<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Windows APPC Overview</h3>
 
<P>
Windows APPC defines a standard and consistent API for the 16 and 32-bit
versions of the Microsoft Windows graphical environment. It encompasses a
set of Windows-specific extensions designed to allow the programmer to take
advantage of the message-driven nature of the Windows graphical
environment.
<P>
This API has been designed and specified to provide a standard to which
application developers can program and network software vendors can
conform. These API details constitute documentation for application
software developers and a specification for network software vendors.
<P>
Network software that conforms to this Windows APPC specification will be
considered "Windows APPC compliant." To be Windows APPC compliant, a vendor
must implement 100 percent of this Windows APPC specification. Suppliers of
such interfaces shall be referred to as "Windows APPC suppliers."
<P>
Applications that are capable of exploiting any Windows APPC implementation
will be considered as having a "Windows APPC interface" and will be
referred to as "Windows APPC applications."
<P>
The purpose of this document is to specify the Windows APPC interface. It
is assumed that the reader has a basic understanding APPC concepts.
<P>
While this is one of the WinSNA APIs to be standardized for the Windows
environment, it is beyond the scope of this document to deal with other SNA
(Systems Network Architecture) APIs.
<P>
Microsoft Windows Graphical Environment and Windows-Specific
Extensions
 
<P>
This API has been designed for ALL implementations and versions of the
Windows environment from and including version 3.0. It thus provides for
Windows APPC implementations and Windows APPC applications in both 16- and
32-bit operating environments.
<P>
Windows APPC makes provisions for multithreaded Windows-based processes. A
process contains one or more threads of execution. In the Win16 non-
multithreaded world, a task corresponds to a process with a single thread.
All references to threads in this document refer to actual "threads" in
multithreaded Windows environments. In non-multithreaded environments (such
as version 3.0), use of the term thread refers to a Windows process.
<P>
The extensions to the Windows environment included in Windows APPC are
provided for maximum programming compatibility between Windows 3.x and
Windows NT and optimum application performance in both environments.
<P>
WINAPPC can be found in the Software/Data Library by searching on the word
WINAPPC, the Q number of this article, or S13710. WINAPPC was archived
using the PKware file-compression utility.
