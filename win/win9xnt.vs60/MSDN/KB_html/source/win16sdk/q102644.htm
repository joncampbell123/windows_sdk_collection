<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
LINK error L2023 is caused by an incorrect library link order. The linker
resolves external references in order of appearance of the libraries,
choosing the first occurrence of a label. This error occurs when a dynamic-
link library (DLL) exports the routine Windows exit procedure (WEP) that
will be brought in from the C Run-time library static .OBJs, but the linker
finds another DLL's WEP in its .LIB file because it appears BEFORE the C
Run-time library.
<P>
It would be best if DLL import libraries didn't include the WEP. This is
possible by using the PRIVATE keyword in you .DEF file when exporting your
WEP. Or, edit the .LIB via the LIB.EXE utility to remove the WEP reference.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If the MFC libraries are used, they should be included before any other
libraries. As for the other libraries, the Windows libraries should be
included first (that is, LIBW, COMMDLG, SHELL, and so forth), the C Run-
time second (that is, xLIBCyW.LIB for applications or xDLLCyW.LIB for
DLLs), and any additional third-party libraries last (that is, your own or
other's .LIBs). For example, when linking a small model DLL that uses
another DLL's routines via an import library, the library order would be
"LIBW.LIB SDLLCEW.LIB OTHERDLL.LIB". The order should be changed only if a
DLL routine was to replace one of the routines in the Windows libraries or
CRT.
