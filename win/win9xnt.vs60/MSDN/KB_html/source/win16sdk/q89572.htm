The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK), version 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The information below demonstrates the basic functionality of the
Microsoft Setup Toolkit for Windows that is included with version 3.1
of the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK). The Setup
Toolkit is a collection of tools and programs designed to build a
"setup" disk, that is, a disk (or group of disks) that install one or
more files onto a client's computer system.
<P>
Because the Setup program itself is designed for the Microsoft Windows
graphical environment, the Toolkit is primarily aimed at building
installation disks for the Windows environment. Functions in the
Toolkit copy software and other data files to the target disk, add
groups and items to the Microsoft Windows Program Manager, and create
or modify initialization (.INI) files. This tutorial does not discuss
all of these features; it concentrates on using the setup disk layout
tools and on creating a "basic" setup disk.
<P>
This tutorial covers the following topics:

<UL><LI>Selecting the files to install on the client's system
<LI>Including the required Toolkit files on the setup disks
<LI>Creating the required directory structure on the client's system
<LI>Controlling file compression
<LI>Using the Dsklayt and Dsklayt2 utilities in the Setup Toolkit
<P>
</UL>This tutorial, which uses the sample script file included with the
Toolkit (with minor modifications), is designed to provide an overview
of the capabilities of the Toolkit. Before applying the Toolkit to any
particular task, additional information and preparation is required.
<P>
This tutorial does not discuss the following tasks:

<UL><LI>Modifying the dialog boxes in Setup.
<LI>Modifying the setup scripts (beyond the minimum changes required to
   accomplish the tutorial's objectives).
<LI>Using the Setup procedures. (Even though the tasks in this tutorial
   use Setup procedures, the tutorial does not discuss them in any
   detail.)
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Setup Toolkit contains three major component groups:

<OL><P><LI>The disk layout utilities that create "setup" disks. A client uses
   the setup disks to install software onto a target system. The
   primary focus of this tutorial is these utilities and how to use
   them.

<P><LI>The setup tools required to install the software. Microsoft
   provides the setup tools in the SDK. The setup tools must be
   included on the setup disks. This tutorial discusses the setup
   tools only briefly.

<P><LI>Dialog boxes, sample setup scripts, and other files that control
   the appearance and operation of the Setup program. These factors
   are either ignored by this tutorial or are discussed at only the
   most basic level.
<P>
</OL>The Setup Toolkit directory (by default, C:\WINDEV\MSSETUP or
C:\C700\MSSETUP) contains two information files in Microsoft Windows
Write format: README.WRI and FILEDESC.WRI. These files provide a great
deal of reference information.
<P>
As outlined in the "Setup Toolkit for Windows" manual provided with
the Windows SDK, using the Setup Toolkit involves seven steps, as
follows:

<OL><P><LI>Identify the files to install.
</OL>2. Design a directory structure for those files.
3. Identify all user-defined parameters.
4. Design the required dialog boxes.
5. Modify the sample script files.
6. Create images of the installation disks.
7. Test the setup disks.
<P>
This tutorial concentrates on steps 1, 2, and 6.
<P>
The remainder of this article is organized as follows:

<UL><LI>Discuss steps 1 and 2 (identify files and directories)
<LI>Exercise 1: Create a directory of files to install
<LI>Briefly discuss steps 3, 4, and 5 (parameters, dialog boxes, script
   files)
<LI>Discuss step 6 (create disk images)
<LI>Exercise 2: Use the Dsklayt utility
<LI>Exercise 3: Modify the setup list file
<LI>Exercise 4: Modify the script file
<LI>Exercise 5: Use the Dsklayt2 utility
<LI>Exercise 6: Create and test the setup disks
<P>
</UL><h3>Identify the Files to Install</h3>
 
<P>
To build setup disks, it is necessary to determine the files to
install on the target system. This tutorial outlines the procedures to
install the Generic application, one of the sample applications
discussed in the Windows SDK "Guide to Programming" manual. Feel free
to substitute other files if Generic is not readily available. Under
normal circumstances, installing an application would not involve
installing source code (source code might be an optional item).
However, the steps outlined below install the source code to Generic
along with its executable file. The source files are listed below in
the discussion of directory structure.
<P>
NOTE: Make sure that you build the Generic executable before the first
exercise. For more information, see Chapter 1 of the "Guide to
Programming" manual.
<P>
In addition to the installed files, you must include some Setup
Toolkit files on the setup disks. The process marks these files to
prevent them from being installed on the client's system.
<P>
<P><h3>Design a Directory Structure</h3>
 
<P>
Given the list of files to install, determine where the files belong
on the client's system. As a practical matter, it helps to build the
directory structure and to copy the files into it. Then you can build
setup disks from these files. If disk space is very tight, you may not
be able to build the complete tree structure. In that case, remember
that the Dsklayt utility cannot change directories. Therefore, you
must start it in a directory that can access all the needed files,
including the Toolkit files. This tutorial discusses these
considerations in more detail below.
<P>
<P><h3>Exercise 1: Files and Directories</h3>
 
<P>
This exercise uses the following directory structure:
<P>
<PRE>   Root
    |
    +Generic
       |
       +Sources

</PRE></OL>In other words, the GENERIC directory is a child of the root and it
has a subdirectory named SOURCES. Copy all the files from the SDK
Guide samples GENERIC directory into the GENERIC\SOURCES directory.
Move GENERIC.EXE from the SOURCES directory to the GENERIC directory.
Copy the following files from the SDK Setup Toolkit directory into the
GENERIC directory: all .EXE files, all .DLL files, all .INC files,
SAMPLE1.MST, and SETUP.LST. The files marked with "&lt;&lt;&lt;" in the list
below are not required for all installations. The FILEDESC.WRI file
details when these files are needed. Although it is always safe to
include these files, they consume space on the setup disks.
<P>
If you create the GENERIC directory from the root of the C drive, the
MS-DOS TREE utility (tree \generic /f /a) shows the directory
structure as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   C:GENERIC
   |   GENERIC.EXE
   |   _MSSETUP.EXE
   |   _MSTEST.EXE
   |   MSCOMSTF.DLL
   |   MSCUISTF.DLL
   |   MSDETECT.INC
   |   MSDETSTF.DLL
   |   MSINSSTF.DLL
   |   MSREGDB.INC      &lt;&lt;&lt;
   |   MSSHARED.INC     &lt;&lt;&lt;
   |   MSSHLSTF.DLL
   |   MSUILSTF.DLL     &lt;&lt;&lt;
   |   SAMPLE1.MST
   |   SETUP.EXE
   |   SETUP.LST
   |   SETUPAPI.INC
   |
   \---SOURCES
           GENERIC.C
           GENERIC.DEF
           GENERIC.H
           GENERIC.MAK
           GENERIC.OBJ
           GENERIC.RC
           GENERIC.RES
           GENERIC.STS
           MAKEFILE

</PRE><h3>User Parameters, Dialog Boxes, and Scripts</h3>
 
<P>
During the process of designing how to install an application, it is
necessary to determine items that the user must select or specify.
These could include optional files (such as the source directory in
this example), the drive and directory to install to, the registered
owner's name, and so forth. After gathering this information, the next
step is to modify the dialog boxes and rebuild the resource dynamic-
link library (DLL) that Setup uses. Choose one of the sample setup
scripts and modify it as required. The exercises below involve some
minor modifications to the SAMPLE1.MST script.
<P>
For more information on the resource DLL, see the Setup BDLCUI (build
customer interface) directory.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating the Setup Disk Images</h3>
 
<P>
The user runs the Setup program from floppy disks. The Toolkit
provides two programs that arrange the files and create floppy disks.
Dsklayt, the first layout program, runs in the Windows environment.
Use this tool to specify the files to include in the setup disk images
and the characteristics of the files. Dsklayt2, the second layout
program, runs in the MS-DOS environment (outside Windows) and reads
the layout (.LYT) file that Dsklayt creates. Dsklayt2 creates disk
images and the information (.INF) file the Setup program uses to
install files from the floppy disks to the target system.
<P>
Because the Toolkit program files must be on the first setup disk but
should not be installed on the target system, you must edit the
information file that Dsklayt2 creates.
<P>
Note the following considerations when building the file layout and
disk images:

<UL><LI>Because Dsklayt cannot change directories, all Toolkit files must
   be in the same directory as the project code. Although Dsklayt
   reads subdirectories, it does not read parent directories. The
   GENERIC directory was designed as outlined above to address this
   limitation.

<LI>In the Dsklayt utility, place the Toolkit files on disk 1. The
   default file settings specify compressed files. Two of the Toolkit
   files, SETUP.EXE and SETUP.LST, must not be compressed. If you
   compress the other files, you must edit the SETUP.LST file to
   account for the compression. The exercises below show how to do
   this.

<LI>Dsklayt2 builds an .INF file, which is required by the Setup
   program. When you run Dsklayt to specify the files to include in
   the disk images, the .INF file has not yet been created, which
   prevents you from listing it in the disk images. Dsklayt2
   compensates for this and places the .INF file on setup disk 1 as
   required. However, Dsklayt2 compresses the .INF file and places a
   compressed copy of the .INF file with the extenxion .IN_ in the disk
   image directory. To work around this, copy the .INF file to the disk
   image directory before copying the files to the floppy disks.

<LI>The .INF file that Dsklayt2 creates instructs the Setup program to
   copy all the files. The only method of preventing the Setup program
   from copying the Toolkit files (SETUP.EXE and so forth) along with
   the program is to edit the INF file. Instructions on modifying the
   .INF file are presented in the exercises below.

<LI>The Dsklayt2 program provides the /k option to build 360K setup
   disks. However, most of the Toolkit files must be compressed to fit
   on a 360K disk.
<P>
</UL><h3>Exercise 2: Using the Dsklayt Program</h3>
 
<P>
The Dsklayt utility runs in the Windows environment. If you use the
Toolkit often, you might find it convenient to create an icon in the
Program Manager that runs the Dsklayt utility.
<P>
When the program first starts, Dsklayt determines if you want to
create a new layout or open an existing layout. For this exercise,
create a new layout. For the source directory, specify the GENERIC
directory created in Exercise 1.
<P>
Dsklayt displays all the files in the specified directory, including
all the files in all the subdirectories. Initially, each file is
selected to be included on the setup disks and each has the following
attributes:

<UL><LI>Install on any disk
<LI>Vital file (this file must be present or the Setup program fails)
<LI>Compress file when laying out setup disks
<LI>Check for version information
<LI>Always overwrite existing file on target disk
<LI>Decompress file when installing on target disk
<LI>Mark file as read-only on target disk
<P>
</UL>These options are not the best for most situations. They cause
particular problems when they are applied to the Toolkit files.
Therefore, change these default attributes as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Select all the files by clicking the mouse on the first file in the
   files list box and dragging to the last file. Alternatively, use
   the arrow keys to place the cursor on the first file, press the
   SPACEBAR to select the file, and press SHIFT+END to select all the
   files.

<P><LI>Cancel the selection for the following options:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Check For Version
    - Mark As Read-Only
</PRE>
<P><LI>Select SETUP.EXE and clear the Compress check box.

<P><LI>Select SETUP.LST and clear the Compress check box.

<P><LI>Select all the Toolkit files. (In this exercise, these are all the
   files in the GENERIC directory except for GENERIC.EXE.) Mark these
   files for setup disk 1.

<P><LI>To create the SOURCES directory on the target disk and place the
   source files in this new directory, each file in the SOURCES
   directory must be renamed when the Setup program copies it from the
   setup disks. To rename the files:
<P>
   a. Select the first file in the SOURCES directory.
   b. Select the Rename Copied File check box.
   c. In the Edit box, type "sources\" (without quotation marks)
<P><PRE>      followed by the name of the file.
</PRE>   d. Repeat steps a-c for each file in the SOURCES directory.
<P>
   For example:
<P>
   a. Select the GENERIC.C file in the Sources directory.
   b. Select the Rename Copied File check box.
   c. Type the following in the Edit box:
<P>
<PRE>         sources\generic.c

</PRE><P><LI>From the File menu, choose Save to store the layout. Give it the
   name SAMPLE1.LYT. Be sure to specify the GENERIC directory. The
   default in Dsklayt is to save the file in the MSSETUP\DISKLAY
   directory.

<P><LI>Close Dsklayt.
<P>
</OL><h3>Exercise 3: Modifying the SETUP.LST File</h3>
 
<P>
The SETUP.LST file is included with the Toolkit. It lists the files
that the Setup program copies into a temporary directory. The default
SETUP.LST file assumes that the other Toolkit files are not
compressed. To correct this assumption, you must edit the file.
SETUP.LST contains two sections, labeled [Params] and [Files]. The
[Files] section of the default SETUP.LST file is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   [Files]
       sample1.mst  = sample1.mst
       sample1.inf  = sample1.inf
       setupapi.inc = setupapi.inc
       msdetect.inc = msdetect.inc
       mscomstf.dll = mscomstf.dll
       msinsstf.dll = msinsstf.dll
       msuilstf.dll = msuilstf.dll
       msshlstf.dll = msshlstf.dll
       mscuistf.dll = mscuistf.dll
       msdetstf.dll = msdetstf.dll
       _mstest.exe  = _mstest.exe
       _mssetup.exe = _mssetup.exe

</PRE></OL>It is necessary to modify entries in this section to indicate that
some of the files are compressed. To ease the process of identifying a
compressed file, the last character of the filename extension of a
compressed file is replaced with an underscore (_) character. Use any
file editor (for example, the Edit application for MS-DOS or the
Notepad application for Windows) to change the [Files] section as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>   [Files]
       sample1.ms_  = sample1.mst
       sample1.inf  = sample1.inf
       setupapi.in_ = setupapi.inc
       msdetect.in_ = msdetect.inc
       mscomstf.dl_ = mscomstf.dll
       msinsstf.dl_ = msinsstf.dll
       msuilstf.dl_ = msuilstf.dll
       msshlstf.dl_ = msshlstf.dll
       mscuistf.dl_ = mscuistf.dll
       msdetstf.dl_ = msdetstf.dll
       _mstest.ex_  = _mstest.exe
       _mssetup.ex_ = _mssetup.exe

</PRE>The SAMPLE1.INF file (the information file created with Dsklayt2 in
Exercise 5 below) will not be compressed. You will edit this file
later in Exercise 5.
<P>
<P><h3>Exercise 4: Modifying the SAMPLE1.MST Script File</h3>
 
<P>
The SAMPLE1.MST script file performs a few steps that are not
necessary for this example. SAMPLE1.MST creates an initialization
(.INI) file for the installed application and it adds a program group
and icon to the Windows Program Manager. Although these steps are
useful for an actual Setup program, they create unnecessary work for
testing purposes. This exercise modifies the setup script to eliminate
these unnecessary steps.
<P>
Instead of removing lines from the setup script, this exercise
involves inserting the comment character at the beginning of the
unnecessary lines of the file. (In an actual setup script, removing
lines is more efficient and uses less disk space.) An apostrophe (')
character at the beginning of a line marks the line as a comment.
Using a file editor, comment out lines 182 and 184-197. After
inserting the comment characters, lines 182 through 198 appear as
follows:
<P>
&lt;line 181 follows&gt;

<P>
NOTE: Due to the margins of this document, a few of the lines in the
file "wrapped" and require more than one line above.
<P>
<P><h3>Exercise 5: Using the Dsklayt2 program</h3>
 
<P>
Dsklayt2 is an application for MS-DOS that reads the layout
information file that Dsklayt creates (in this case SAMPLE1.LYT) and
creates two items: a set of disk images and an information file. The
disk images are used to build setup disks. The Setup program uses the
information file to place the files on the target disk.
<P>
The Dsklayt2 program accepts several parameters, some of which are
required for the application to work. For this exercise, set the
current directory to the GENERIC directory created in Exercise 1 and
issue the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   dsklayt2 sample1.lyt c:\disk1\sample1.inf /k144 /f /dc:\ /cc:\comp

</PRE>The individual terms of this command line are as follows:

<UL><LI>"dsklayt2": The filename of the Dsklayt2 application. Because the
   Toolkit installs Dsklayt2 in the Windows SDK MSSETUP\DISKLAY
   directory, the full path to this file is required unless this
   directory is in the MS-DOS PATH environment variable. If you use
   this utility often, you might want to add the directory to the PATH
   or place the full command into a batch file.

<LI>"sample1.lyt": The layout file produced by the Dsklayt utility.

<LI>"c:\disk1\sample1.inf": The filename for the created information
   file. Specifying this path ensures that Dsklayt2 places the
   information file on setup disk 1 (see the discussion of the /d
   parameter, below).

<LI>"/k144": The size of the setup disks. Valid options are 360 (for
   360K disks), 720 (for 720K disks), 12 (for 1.2 MB disks), 144 (for
   1.44 MB disks), and N (for a network installation).

<LI>"/f": Overwrite the .INF file if one already exists. This parameter
   is not required unless you run Dsklayt2 more than once and specify
   the same destination directory.

<LI>"/dc:\": The destination directory for the disk images. If you omit
   the /d option, Dsklayt2 creates only an .INF file (no disk images).
   Specifying "c:\" causes Dsklayt2 to create the disk images in
   directories named "disk1," "disk2," and so forth in the root
   directory of drive C.

<LI>"/cc:\comp": Storage for compressed files before they are copied
   into the disk images. This parameter is optional. However, if it is
   necessary to build the disk images more than once, specifying a
   location to store the compressed files speeds the process
   considerably.
<P>
</UL>After running Dsklayt2, you must edit the information file
(C:\DISK1\SAMPLE1.INF) to prevent the Toolkit files from being copied
to the target disk. Use a file editor to remove the lines in the
[Files] section that refer to the Toolkit files. The resulting file
contains only references to the files in the Generic sample
application and look like the text below. Note that the lines in the
[Files] section have been edited to fit the margins of this document.

<P><h3>Exercise 6: Create Setup Disks and Test</h3>
 
<P>
At this stage of the process, an installation disk image is available
in the C:\DISK1 directory. (If you chose to specify 720K disks, you
probably have two disk image directories: C:\DISK1 and C:\DISK2.) To
create installation disks, copy all the files from each disk image
directory to a corresponding floppy disk (label the disks to keep them
in order).
<P>
To test the installation, place the first disk in a floppy disk drive
and run the Setup program from the Program Manager or the File
Manager. Because these exercises did not change the setup script (in
any major way) or modify the dialog boxes, the Setup program includes
some screens that are not required by this particular demonstration.
Specify any desired target drive and directory. If you choose the
default, C:\DEMO, SETUP creates a DEMO directory that contains two
files, GENERIC.EXE and a .LOG file, and a SOURCES subdirectory with
the other files.

<P><h3>Summary</h3>
 
<P>
This tutorial covered the following topics:

<UL><LI>Creating a target directory structure for files to install and
   placing the files into the structure
<LI>Using the Dsklayt utility to map the files onto setup disks
<LI>Using the Dsklayt2 utility to create disk images
<LI>Modifying the setup script and information file to make the setup
   process flow smoothly and to prevent extra files from being
   created
<LI>Copying the disk images onto floppy disks
<LI>Testing the setup disks to verify that the disks work correctly
<P>
</UL>The following directories were created by the exercises in this
tutorial if the directory names listed were used: COMP, DEMO,
DEMO\SOURCES, DISK1, GENERIC, and GENERIC\SOURCES. (If you selected
720K disks, a DISK2 directory was created as well). Delete the files
in these directories and the directories themselves, if desired.
