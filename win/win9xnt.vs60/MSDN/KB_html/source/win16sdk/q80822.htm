<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Certain types of applications, such as security applications and possibly
some setup programs, require the ability to disable task switching under
Windows. To disable task switching, the program must prevent the user from
accessing the Task List, using mouse or keystroke combinations to switch to
other applications, and so forth.
<P>
The NOSWITCH application in the Microsoft Software Library demonstrates how
an application can disable the task switch.
<P>
Download NOSWITCH.EXE, a self-extracting file, from the Microsoft Software
Library (MSL) on the following services:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Download Service (MSDL)
<P><PRE>      Dial (206) 936-6735 to connect to MSDL
      Download <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/noswitch.exe">NOSWITCH.EXE</A> <I>(size: 24034 bytes)</I> 
</PRE>
<LI>Internet (anonymous FTP)
<P><PRE>      ftp ftp.microsoft.com
      Change to the \SOFTLIB\MSLFILES directory
      Get <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/noswitch.exe">NOSWITCH.EXE</A> <I>(size: 24034 bytes)</I> 
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NOSWITCH demonstrates how an application can disable task switching. The
application must take the following four steps to disable task switching:

<OL><P><LI>Subclass the desktop window to prevent the Task List from being
   displayed when the user double-clicks the desktop window.

<P><LI>Prevent the user from using key combinations to switch to another
   task by trapping the following three wParam values for the
   WM_SYSCOMMAND message: SC_NEXTWINDOW, SC_PREVWINDOW, and
   SC_TASKLIST.

<P><LI>Prevent other applications from activating themselves by
   enumerating all top-level windows, and disabling the windows that
   do not belong to this application.

<P><LI>Each time a WM_INITMEMUPOPUP message is received for the system
   menu, disable the menu items that relate to switching tasks.
<P>
</OL>Before exiting the application, reverse the effects of any actions taken to
prevent switching tasks. Refer to the NOSWITCH sample for complete details.
<P>
There is a simpler, more limited, method to disable task switching. If the
application is run as a maximized window, then step 2 above is enough to
prevent switching tasks. However, the application must prevent the window
from being restored or minimized. The limitation to this method is that the
application must run as a maximized window.
