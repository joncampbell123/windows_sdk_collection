The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" was written and distributed before the
release of Microsoft Windows version 3.1, the Microsoft Windows Software
Development Kit (SDK) version 3.1, and Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing
version 1.0. Subsequent to the release of the Windows Resource Kit, the Pen
SDK was eliminated. Its components were added to the Windows SDK, the
Microsoft Windows Device Driver Kit (DDK) and the Microsoft Windows for Pen
Computing OEM Adaptation Kit (OAK).
<P>
The text below corrects errors in and misinterpretations of the Windows
Resource Kit caused by the elimination of the Pen SDK.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Pages 506 through 514 of the Windows Resource Kit manual document the
attributes of Windows for Pen Computing. However, the Pen SDK has been
eliminated and its components are part of the Windows SDK, Windows DDK, and
Pen OAK. A complete description of the Windows for Pen Computing components
provided by each of these sources is available in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base.
<P>
Pages 508 and 509 state that the Pen Palette, the Trainer, and the Control
Panel applications are provided with the Pen SDK. These components have
been moved into the Pen OAK; they are not provided with version 3.1 of the
Windows SDK.
<P>
Page 510 states that the Pen SDK includes sample tablet drivers designed
for WACOM and Scriptel tablets. The sample tablet drivers are now part of
the Pen OAK. Each OEM (original equipment manufacturer) must ship the
appropriate tablet driver with its release of Windows for Pen Computing.
<P>
Page 510 also states that sample video driver code is in the Pen SDK; the
sample video drivers are part of the Windows DDK. However, a VGA pen driver
is included in PEN directory of the Windows 3.1 SDK (by default,
C:\WINDEV\PEN).
<P>
Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing is an OEM product that is customized
and sold by a number of pen computer and pen tablet peripheral
manufacturers. It is often confused with the Pen Extensions provided with
version 3.1 of the Windows SDK. The Pen Extensions augment a Windows 3.1
installation to support pen input and pen-based applications.
