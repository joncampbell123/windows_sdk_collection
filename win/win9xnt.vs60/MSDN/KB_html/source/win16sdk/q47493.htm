<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses various considerations regarding the Microsoft
Linker and its /ALIGN option when it is used to develop applications
for the Microsoft Windows environment. This information also applies
to the development of dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
According to its definition, the Microsoft Linker /ALIGN option
"directs the linker to align segment data in the executable file along
the boundaries specified by 'size.'" The "size" parameter is in bytes
and must be a power of 2. Specifying /ALIGN:16 on the LINK line aligns
segments on 16-byte boundaries. Making an /ALIGN:16 specification is
recommended for Windows-based applications and dynamic-link libraries
(DLLs) because the default alignment is 512.
<P>
When the linker creates an EXE file and /ALIGN:16 is specified, if a
segment does not end on a 16-byte boundary, the segment is padded with
extra bytes. The next segment always begins at a 16-byte boundary.
<P>
If an application contains several small segments, and no /ALIGN
option is specified on the Linker command line, each segment will
contain a great deal of wasted space and the resulting EXE file will
be unnecessarily large. The amount of wasted space is computed as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>   waste = align - (segment modulo align)

</PRE>Therefore, for a 514-byte segment, an align size of 512 causes 510
bytes to be wasted. However, for the same segment, an alignment size
of 2 bytes does not waste any space.
<P>
Problems can arise when the Linker creates a very large EXE file using
a small align value because the size of the EXE may exceed the range
of values that can be represented by the EXE header segment table.
<P>
To demonstrate the problems that can arise, consider a very large EXE
file that is linked with an align size of 2. During the process of
creating this EXE file, the Linker puts segment 42 at file offset
380,000 and records the position in the New EXE Segment Table. The
format of this table is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Offset  Length  Contents
   ------  ------  --------

      0h      2    Offset of segment relative to beginning of file
                   after shifting value left by alignment shift count.

      2h      2    Length of segment (0h for segment of 65536 bytes).

      4h      2    Segment flag word.

      6h      2    Minimum allocation size for segment; that is,
                   amount of space Windows reserves in memory for the
                   segment (0h for minimum allocation size of 65536
                   bytes).

</PRE>In this case, the offset of the segment to place in the table is
(380,000 &gt;&gt; 1) = 190,000, which is too large to store in a 16-bit word
(the maximum value is 65,535). Therefore, 58,928 (the low-order 16
bits of 190,000) is stored. Unfortunately, the Linker does not provide
any warning of the data loss involved with this step.
<P>
When Windows loads segment 42 from the EXE file, it takes the value
58,928 and multiplies it by the align size (2), which results in an
offset of 117,856 and does not lead to the desired segment in the
file.
<P>

Press). Also refer to the article "Liposuction Your Corpulent Executables
and Remove Excess Fat" by Matt Pietrek in the Microsoft Systems Journal,
vol. 8, no. 7, July 1993 which describes a sample tool called EXESIZE.
