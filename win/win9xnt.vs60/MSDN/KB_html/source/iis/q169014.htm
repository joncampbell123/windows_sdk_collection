<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to setup a remote debug for troubleshooting 
problems with your Internet Information Server (IIS). These steps 
should be followed after you consult a Microsoft Support Engineer and 
you agree that a debug is necessary.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Process 1 - To install the symbol files</h3>
 
<P>
This process should be used to enhance the output log of a Dr. Watson 
file. It should also be used in conjunction with Process 2 for a remote
debug.

<OL><P><LI>Make sure you are running the latest Service Pack (SP) update to 
    Microsoft Windows NT Server.

<P><LI>Obtain the latest Service Pack symbols file from the Service Pack
    compact disc or our FTP site at ftp.microsoft.com in the following 
    directory:
   
       bussys\winnt\winnt-public\fixes\usa\nt40\symbols\
<P>
    (use I for Intel or A for Alpha)

<P><LI>If you install from the downloaded symbols file, type in the 
    following command to install them:
<P>
       Filename -d Install Path
<P>
    where Filename is the downloaded file, and Install Path is the path
    to your Windows NT Server directory with \Symbols appended. 
    For example, Sym_400I.exe -d C:\Winnt\Symbols.

<P><LI>If you install from the SP compact disc, copy all subdirectories
    from the Support\Debug\Symbols directory to the Winnt\Symbols
    directory.
<P>
</OL><h3>Process 2 - To set up for a debug</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a directory called Debug under your Windows NT directory.

<P><LI>Unzip and copy the following files (from the Windows NT Resource 
    Kit) to the debug directory you created:
 
       Tlist.exe (in the \Compdiag directory)
       Remote.exe (in the \Netadmin directory)
<P>
    If you do not have the resource kit, you can obtain these files 
    from your Microsoft Support Engineer.

<P><LI>Copy the .Exe and .Dll files located on the Windows NT compact disc
    (\Support\Debug\) to the Debug directory.

<P><LI>Start a command window and change into your debug directory.

<P><LI>Use Tlist.exe file to list the processes. Make a note of the ID 
    for the Inetinfo.exe process. It is the number to the left of the 
    process.

<P><LI>Type in the following command (leaving quotes in place):
<P>
       Remote /s "cdb -p " debug

<P><LI>At the debug prompt, type the following:
<P>
       .logopen c:\debug.txt

<P><LI>Press g and ENTER to restart the inet service.

<P><LI>Minimize the command window and wait for the server to stop. 
    Contact your Support Engineer, and then start the remote session.
<P>
</OL><h3>Process 3 - To set up RAS</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Make sure you have RAS service installed on a Windows NT Server 
<P><PRE>    on the network.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Make sure that the RAS is set up to receive incoming calls.

<P><LI>Create a user account that is a member of the administrators group.
<P><PRE>    Ensure that the user has dial-in privileges.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Process 4 - To create a debug file</h3>
 
<P>
These steps can be used in case you get a crash, and you 
need to restart the computer before a Debug engineer can get back in 
touch with you. 

<OL><P><LI>In the debug window, type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      kv
</OL></PRE>18. Type the following:
<P>
<PRE>      .logclose

</PRE><P><LI>Type q
</OL>20. You can now restart the server and mail the log file to the Support
<PRE>    Engineer you are working with.
