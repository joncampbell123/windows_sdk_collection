The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Information Server version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you install the World Wide Web (WWW) server from the Internet
Information Server, four new objects are added to the existing list of
objects in Windows NT Performance Monitor. This article describes an object
called Internet Information Server which contains 28 counters.
<P>
Performance Monitor is a graphical tool for measuring the performance of
your own computer or other computers on a network. On each computer, you
can view the behavior of objects such as processors, memory, cache,
threads, and processes. Each of these objects has an associated set of
counters that provide information on such things as device usage, queue
lengths, and delays, as well as information used for throughput and
internal congestion measurements. It provides charting, alerting, and
reporting capabilities that reflect current activity along with ongoing
logging. You can also open log files at a later time for browsing and
charting as if they were reflecting current activity.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The definitions of the counters under the Performance Monitor object World
wide Web server are given below:
<P>
<P><h3>BGI Requests</h3>
 
<P>
Binary Gateway Interface (BGI) requests are custom gateway Dynamic Link
Libraries (*.DLL files) the administrator can install to add forms
processing or other dynamic data sources.
<P>
<P><h3>Bytes Received/sec</h3>
 
<P>
Bytes Received/sec is the rate that data bytes are received by the HTTP
server.
<P>
<P><h3>Bytes Sent/sec</h3>
 
<P>
Bytes Sent/sec is the rate that data bytes are sent by the HTTP server.
<P>
<P><h3>Bytes Total/sec</h3>
 
<P>
Bytes Total/sec is the sum of Bytes Sent/sec and Bytes Received/sec. This
is the total rate of bytes transferred by the HTTP server.
<P>
<P><h3>CGI requests</h3>
 
<P>
Common Gateway Interface (CGI) requests are custom gateway executables
(*.EXE files) the administrator can install to add forms processing or
other dynamic data sources.
<P>
<P><h3>Connection Attempts</h3>
 
<P>
Connection Attempts is the number of connection attempts that have been
made to the HTTP server.
<P>
<P><h3>Connections/sec</h3>
 
<P>
Connections/sec is the number of HTTP requests being handled per second.
<P>
<P><h3>Current Anonymous Users</h3>
 
<P>
Current Anonymous Users is the number of anonymous users currently
connected to the HTTP server.
<P>
<P><h3>Current BGI Requests</h3>
 
<P>
Current BGI Requests is the current number of BGI requests that are
simultaneously being processed by the HTTP server.
<P>
<P><h3>Current CGI Requests</h3>
 
<P>
Current CGI Requests is the current number of CGI requests that are
simultaneously being processed by the HTTP server. This includes WAIS index
queries.
<P>
<P><h3>Current Connections</h3>
 
<P>
Current Connections is the current number of connections to the HTTP
server.
<P>
<P><h3>Current NonAnonymous Users</h3>
 
<P>
Current NonAnonymous Users is the number of nonanonymous users currently
connected to the HTTP server.
<P>
<P><h3>Files Received</h3>
 
<P>
Files Received is the total number of files received by the HTTP server.
<P>
<P><h3>Files Sent</h3>
 
<P>
Files Sent is the total number of files sent by the HTTP server.
<P>
<P><h3>Files Total</h3>
 
<P>
Files Total is the sum of Files Sent and Files Received. This is the total
number of files transferred by the HTTP server.
<P>
<P><h3>Get Requests</h3>
 
<P>
Get Requests is the number of HTTP requests using the GET method. Get
requests are generally used for basic file retrievals or image maps, though
they can be used with forms.
<P>
<P><h3>Head Requests</h3>
 
<P>
Head Requests is the number of HTTP requests using the HEAD method. Head
requests generally indicate a client is querying the state of a document
they already have, to see if it needs to be refreshed.
<P>
<P><h3>Logon Attempts</h3>
 
<P>
Logon Attempts is the number of logon attempts that have been made by the
HTTP server.
<P>
<P><h3>Maximum Anonymous Users</h3>
 
<P>
Maximum Anonymous Users is the maximum number of anonymous users
simultaneously connected to the HTTP server.
<P>
<P><h3>Maximum BGI Requests</h3>
 
<P>
Maximum BGI Requests is the maximum number of BGI requests that are
simultaneously being processed by the HTTP server.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Maximum CGI Requests</h3>
 
<P>
Maximum CGI Requests is the maximum number of CGI requests that are
simultaneously being processed by the HTTP server. This includes WAIS index
queries.
<P>
<P><h3>Maximum Connections</h3>
 
<P>
Maximum Connections is the maximum number of simultaneous connections to
the HTTP server.
<P>
<P><h3>Maximum NonAnonymous Users</h3>
 
<P>
Maximum NonAnonymous Users is the maximum number of nonanonymous users
simultaneously connected to the HTTP server.
<P>
<P><h3>Not Found Errors</h3>
 
<P>
Not Found Errors is the number of requests that could not be satisfied by
the server because the requested document could not be found. These are
generally reported as an HTTP 404 error code to the client.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Other Request methods</h3>
 
<P>
Other Request methods is the number of HTTP requests that are not GET, POST
or HEAD methods. These may include PUT, DELETE, LINK or other methods
supported by gateway applications.
<P>
<P><h3>Post Requests</h3>
 
<P>
Post Requests is the number of HTTP requests using the POST method. Post
requests are generally used for forms or gateway requests.
<P>
<P><h3>Total Anonymous Users</h3>
 
<P>
Total Anonymous Users is the total number of anonymous users that have ever
connected to the HTTP server.
<P>
<P><h3>Total NonAnonymous Users</h3>
 
<P>
Total NonAnonymous Users is the total number of nonanonymous users that
have ever connected to the HTTP server.
