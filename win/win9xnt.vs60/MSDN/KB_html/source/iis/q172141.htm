<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can use three different logging file methods with Internet 
Information Server (IIS). These methods are Daily, Weekly, and 
Monthly. You can select these methods by selecting the appropriate
service computer name in Internet Service Manager. Then select
Properties, Service Properties, then the Logging tab. 
<P>
The Daily log files are created at 12:00 A.M. of each day. They use 
the following date format for filenames: INyymmdd.log.
<P>
The Weekly log files are created at 12:00 A.M. on Sunday of each 
week. They use the following date format for filenames: INyymmww.log.
<P>
The Monthly log files are created at 12:00 A.M. on the first day of 
each month. They use the following date format for filenames: 
INyymm.log.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you switch from Daily to Weekly logging formats, a new Weekly 
log file is created at the time the change is applied, then again at
12:00 A.M. on Sunday of each week. 
<P>
For example, on Friday afternoon the change is made from Daily to 
Weekly format. A new Weekly log file is created at this time, 
then again at 12:00 A.M. the following Sunday.
<P>
When you switch from Daily or Weekly to Monthly logging formats, 
a new Monthly log file is created at the time the change is applied, 
then again at 12:00 A.M. on the first day of the next month.
<P>
For example, on Friday afternoon the change is made from Daily to 
Monthly format. A new Weekly log file is created at this time, then 
again at 12:00 A.M. the first day of the following month.
