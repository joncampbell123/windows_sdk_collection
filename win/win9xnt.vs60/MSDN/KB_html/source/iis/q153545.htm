<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Information Server version 1.0

<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible to pass unsafe characters in a URL by encoding the
characters using the following syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   % HEX

</PRE>where HEX is the hexadecimal value of the unsafe character; for example,
%2B.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For example,
<P>
<PRE>      ASCII TABLE:
      ===========================
      ASCII HEX   ENCODED
        +   2B %2B
        ?   3F        %3F
      ===========================


   +  URL:     <B>http://server/scripts/script.idc?Param=2+2</B>
      ENCODED URL:   <B>http://server/scripts/script.idc?Param=2%3F2</B>


   ?  URL:     <B>http://server/scripts/script.idc?Param=Who?</B>
      ENCODED URL:   <B>http://server/scripts/script.idc?Param=Who%2B</B>

</PRE>RFC 1738 discusses "unsafe characters" in more detail below:
<P>
Unsafe:
<P>
<PRE>   Characters can be unsafe for a number of reasons. The space
   character is unsafe because significant spaces may disappear and
   insignificant spaces may be introduced when URLs are transcribed or
   typeset or subjected to the treatment of word-processing programs.
   The chevron characters, &lt; and &gt;, are unsafe because they are used as the
   delimiters around URLs in free text; the quotation mark (""") is used to
   delimit URLs in some systems. The character # is unsafe and should
   always be encoded because it is used in World Wide Web and in other
   systems to delimit a URL from a fragment/anchor identifier that might
   follow it. The character % is unsafe because it is used for
   encodings of other characters. Other characters are unsafe because
   gateways and other transport agents are known to sometimes modify
   such characters. These characters are {, }, |, \, ^, ~, [, ], and `.

   All unsafe characters must always be encoded within a URL. For
   example, the character # must be encoded within URLs even in
   systems that do not normally deal with fragment or anchor
   identifiers, so that if the URL is copied into another system that
   does use them, it will not be necessary to change the URL encoding.
