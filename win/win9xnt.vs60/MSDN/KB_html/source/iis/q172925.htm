<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article covers the security issues you need to be aware of when
creating or launching ActiveX objects from either an ISAPI extension or an
Active Server Pages (ASP) page.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Whenever an object is created in the context of Internet Information Server
(IIS), the security context it will have depends on the object's threading
model. The security context given to the object will then affect all
actions performed by that object, including such things as accessing files,
accessing databases and creating other objects.
<P>
IIS passes on security contexts depending on the authentication scheme that
you are using in IIS. For example, if you are using Anonymous
authentication, the object runs in the security context of a user account
called IUSR_&lt;machinename&gt;, where &lt;machinename&gt; is the name of the machine
on which IIS is running. For additional information on authentication
schemes and security from IIS, see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../isapi/q158229.htm">Q158229</A></B>
   TITLE     : Security Ramifications for IIS Applications

</PRE>The security context given to an in-process object (a .dll file) is
dependent on its threading model as marked in the registry and how the
client apartment is created. When the threading models between the client
and the server are mixed, such has a single-threaded apartment client
creating a free-threaded or unmarked object, the system must provide a
proxy for interaction between the object and the client apartment. This
proxy is created in and is given the security context of the main
application. In the case of IIS, the proxy runs in the security context of
the SYSTEM account. For additional information on threading models, see the
following article in the Microsoft KnowledgeBase:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../oleprog/q150777.htm">Q150777</A></B>
   TITLE     : Descriptions and Workings of OLE Threading Models

</PRE>What this means to someone creating their own inproc server that will be
called by IIS, through either Active Server Pages or their own custom ISAPI
DLL, is that if the object is not designed with the same threading model as
that used by the client apartment, the object is run in the security
context of the SYSTEM account. This behavior is a potential security
concern, and may also limit the functionality of the component if it needs
to access resources on a remote machine.
<P>
By default ASP creates single-threaded apartment clients, which means that
only single-threaded apartment inproc servers are given the desired
security context passed on by IIS. In ASP it is a good idea to create
single-threaded apartment objects since they will run faster than free-
threaded objects or unmarked objects because they don't go through a proxy
to make the calls. Thus for performance and security reasons, ASP
components should have their Threading Model registry value set to either
"Apartment" or "Both" in the registry.
<P>
If you are instead creating your own ISAPI DLL that will be instantiating
objects and you want to get the security context passed by IIS, you will
need to make sure that you call CoInitializeEx(NULL, COINIT_MULTITHREADED)
for free-threaded apartment servers and CoInitializeEx(NULL,
APARTMENTTHREADED) for single-threaded apartment servers.
<P>
Objects marked as "Both" will get the right security context when
instantiated in either single-thread apartments or free-thread apartments.
However, these objects must be created with the synchronization
considerations of any free-threaded object, which can be considerably more
difficult to program and test.
<P>
<P><h3>DCOM</h3>
 
<P>
Beginning with NT 4.0, the launching and accessing of objects is done
through Distributed COM (DCOM). DCOM allows you to configure the ability of
a client application to launch and access objects on remote machines and
the local machine. This configuration is done through a utility provided
with NT called "DCOMCNFG." You will need to make sure that when a client
application running under a certain account wants to launch or access an
object, it has the proper permissions in DCOM. By default, you will see in
DCOMCNFG that certain accounts already have permission to launch and access
objects, such as the INTERACTIVE account, so that client applications
running as the interactive user can use objects; the SYSTEM account, so the
system can use objects; and the IUSR_&lt;servername&gt; account, passed by IIS.
If you are using some authentication scheme other than anonymous, you need
to make sure that the account that the client is using is listed as having
launch and access permissions.
<P>
<P><h3>Recommendations</h3>
 
<P>
Because of the way IIS assigns and reuses threads, you would typically not
get much benefit from creating a free-threaded apartment object as opposed
to a single-threaded apartment object. Although free-threaded objects do
not need to have their interfaces marshalled between threads of a free-
threaded client apartment, this usually means very little under the context
of IIS because in most cases the only interface of interest is IDispatch,
and the system has a built-in marshaller for this interface. Unless you
plan on using your own ISAPI DLL instead of ASP and are creating an object
that takes a long time to initialize, or you want to pass data between
instances of the objects, you should create single-threaded apartment
objects.
<P>
It is important to note that Visual Basic 4.0 does not create "Apartment"
model objects, but Visual Basic 5.0 does.
<P>
<P><h3>Local Servers</h3>
 
<P>
When a local server object (an .exe file) is instantiated, by default it is
given the SYSTEM security context. However, this can be changed with the
DCOMCNFG utility. For additional information on launching OLE local servers
from IIS, see the following article on the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../isapi/q156223.htm">Q156223</A></B>
   TITLE     : How To Launch OLE Servers from ISAPI Extensions

</PRE><h3>Determining Your Current Security Context</h3>
 
<P>
If you are having problems accessing other files, databases, or objects
from within your object, you can always check your security context
programmatically by adding a call to the Win32 API function: GetUserName().
Or to get the full Domain/UserName call
OpenProcessToken()/GetTokenInformation()/LookupAccoundSID().
<P>
Another way to debug security context problems is to turn on auditing with
the NT User Manager. This will allow you to log selected activities in the
event viewer and is an easy way to determine which account tried to access
a given file or resource.
<P>
<P><h3>Changing Your Security Context</h3>
 
<P>
If for some reason you cannot get the security context that you need, you
can impersonate the desired security context by creating a method in your
automation server that takes as parameters the user name and password of
the security account that you need. Once you have the user name and
password you can change the current security context with the Win32 API
functions: LogonUser() and ImpersonateLoggedOnUser().
