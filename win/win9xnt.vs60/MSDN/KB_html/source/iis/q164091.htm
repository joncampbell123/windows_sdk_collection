<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Information Server version 2.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the permissions to set on directories and files for
an FTP GET and an FTP PUT commands. The following has been tested on
Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 and Internet Information Server
(IIS) version 2.0 and works only on NTFS partitions. The following uses the
anonymous user with the default IUSER_hostname account created by IIS.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For an anonymous user to GET any files from your FTP server the minimum
permission required is READ on the directory and all the subdirectories and
files below the directory. Without this permission the anonymous user will
not be able to GET a file even if he or she knows the name of the file. The
user has to be able to browse through the directories to GET the file he or
she would need.
<P>
The following steps lists how to set these permissions:

<OL><P><LI>Click the NTFS drive.

<P><LI>Select the folder you want to set the permissions on.

<P><LI>Right click the folder, and click Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Security tab and in the Permissions box, click
   Permissions.

<P><LI>Select Special Directory Access and Special File Access from the
   drop down box Type of Access, and select the type of access you
   want to set by selecting Other and checking all options that apply.

<P><LI>Select Read as one of your options. This is required.
<P>
   For users to PUT files into directories or subdirectories they do
   not need Read permission on them. In other words they do not have
   to browse the directory to PUT files into it. The permission they
   would need is Write and if they know the name of the directory to
   PUT files into they can do it successfully without the READ
   permission.
