The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) version 4.0 contains many
improvements. In addition to resolving many of reported issues in IIS 3.0,
IIS 4.0 offers improvements in the areas of application stability and
server management.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following is a summary of new features added to IIS 4.0 in the areas of
application stability and server management, and a list of articles that
discuss known IIS 3.0 issue resolutions. For more information, see the
"Quick Tour of Features" in the online Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack
Documentation.
<P>
<P><h3>Application Stability</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Process isolation
<P>
   Web Applications can be hosted in an environment that protects the core
   Web services from poorly written applications. Isolated Web Applications
   each run within their own Mtx.exe process. In the past, all ASP
   applications ran within the a single Inetinfo.exe process.

<LI>Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) integration
<P>
   Multiple steps and components can now be packaged into transactions that
   succeed or fail as a whole. In IIS 3.0, ASP handled its own thread and
   memory management within Asp.dll. IIS 4.0 takes advantage of the
   improved resource usage and thread management in MTS, which allows Web
   application developers to write scalable applications using the MTS
   foundation.

<LI>Improved database stack
<P>
   Version 4.0 of IIS has an entirely new database stack that is of much
   better quality than the previous release, and includes an improved
   thread-safe Oracle driver.

<LI>ISAPI filtering by Web site
<P>
   Each Web site on the server can have a different set of ISAPI filters.
   ISAPI filters are programs that are executed when a given Web server
   event occurs.

<LI>ASP Debugging
<P>
   IIS 4.0 includes an Active Server Pages debugger that is integrated with
   the core ASP services. With this tool you can set breakpoints and step
   through ASP code. Previously, in IIS 3.0, the only way to debug your ASP
   code was to use Response.Write to send the information to the HTML
   output.

<LI>VBScript and Jscript
<P>
   Version 3.0 of the Scripting engines provide enhanced capabilities such
   as Directory Creation, File and Directory Deletion and the ability to
   determine disk information (for example, the amount of free space and
   similar values).

<LI>New Java VM
<P>
   Support has been added for JDK 1.1 as has the ability to make calls
   to Java components from ASP scripts.

<LI>Message Queuing
<P>
   Web applications using ASP can store data until a guaranteed connection
   is made with the targeted Web application through the use of message
   queuing. This has a significant impact on electronic commerce if it
   uses unreliable networks.
<P>
</UL><h3>Server Management</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Virtual servers using one IP address and host header names
<P>
   Unique virtual Web servers can now be set up using the same IP address
   and different names. Each virtual server can be controlled independently
   of each other.

<LI>HTML administration
<P>
   IIS 4.0 includes a full-featured Web-based administration utility to
   manage the server remotely.

<LI>Improved metatag integration
<P>
   Many functions that could only be done via metatags (expires, pic
   ratings, custom headers) can now be down with the core server.

<LI>Customizable error messages
<P>
   Error messages can be customized to improve the customer (end user of
   Web sites) experience.

<LI>Command line administration
<P>
   The same functionality found in the administration interfaces for IIS
   4.0 is now available through command line administration. This allows
   for easy ASP scripting of administrative tasks.

<LI>Unattended installations
<P>
   Customized installations can be implemented by using scripts to upgrade
   and install multiple servers.

<LI>Integrated setup
<P>
   Unlike IIS 3.0, IIS 4.0 offers an integrated setup for all of the
   components of the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack.

<LI>Site Server Express
<P>
   Tools are included for analyzing content and Web usage as well as for
   posting files through the components of Site Server Express. The Content
   Analyzer, Usage Import, Report Writer, and Posting Acceptor modules make
   up the components of Site Server Express.

<LI>Flexible logging
<P>
   There are now over 20 properties that can be logged for the Web server.
   Included are server name, server IP and port, bytes sent and received,
   time taken, and many more.
<P>
</UL><h3>IIS 3.0 Issue Resolutions</h3>
 
<P>
Many bug fixes for IIS 3.0 are included in IIS 4.0, including all hotfixes
to Active Server Pages (ASP) and core services. The following list is a
sample of known issues which are resolved in IIS 4.0.
