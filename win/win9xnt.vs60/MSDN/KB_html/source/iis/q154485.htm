The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Information Server version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) allows "keep alive connections"
(that is, persistent connections) by default. If clients do not close keep
alive connections, this may result in a large number of TCP connections in
the ESTABLISHED state on the IIS server. These connections can be
identified by running "netstat -n" to see whether a large number of
connections exist in the ESTABLISHED state.
<P>
Because IIS allows keep alive connections by default, any HTTP requests
from a client can result in connections to the server that are not closed
until they are either reset by the client, or timed out by the server. The
default timeout for established connections in IIS is 900 seconds (15
minutes).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
IIS allows keep alive connections by default.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
IIS allows keep alive connections as an optimization to reduce the total
number of TCP connections a client needs to download all the elements
(Images, Audio, etc.) defined on a page. Keep alive connections allow
clients to re-use established TCP connections to the HTTP server to
download several elements on a page. Without keep alive connections a
separate TCP connection is established to get each element on a page,
increasing the load on the HTTP server.
<P>
NOTE: A description of the TCP state machine can be found in Internet RFC
793. A description of the HTTP/1.0, and HTTP/1.1 protocol can be found
on <B><A href="http://www.w3.org/pub/www/protocols">http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Protocols</A></B>
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Obtain the fix described below in the STATUS section, and then modify the
registry according the following steps. W3svc.dll was modified to accept a
registry entry that disables support for keep alive connections.
<P>
The new registry entry is AllowKeepAlives.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>Run "Net Stop w3svc"

<P><LI>Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

<P><LI>From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3svc\Parameters
</PRE><P>
   The parameters described below are located under this Registry subkey.
<P>
   The following describes a new value for the W3SVC service
   parameters key that can only be set by adding an entry in Registry
   Editor.
   This value entry does not appear by default in the Registry, so you
   must add an entry if you want to change its default value. The W3SVC
   service must be restarted for changes to take effect.
<P>
   AllowKeepAlives
<P><PRE>      Data Type = REG_DWORD
      Value:
<PRE></PRE>               0 - Do not allow keep alive connections.
     (Default) 1 - Allow keep alive connections.

</PRE><P><LI>Run "Net Start w3svc"
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51.
A fix to this problem is in development, but has not been
regression-tested and may be destabilizing in production environments.
Microsoft does not recommend implementing this fix at this time. Contact
Microsoft Product Support Services for more information on the
availability of this fix.
