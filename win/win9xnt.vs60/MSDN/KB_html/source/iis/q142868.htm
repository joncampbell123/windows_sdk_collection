</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the Authentication &amp; Security Features of Microsoft
Internet Information Server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Integration with Windows NT</h3>
 
<P>
The World Wide Web (WWW), Gopher, and FTP services included with the
Microsoft Internet Information Server are fully integrated with Windows NT
Server user accounts and file access permissions.
<P>
Every access to a resource (for example, a file, an HTML page, an Internet
Server API (ISAPI) application, etc.) is done by the services on behalf of
a Windows NT user. The service impersonates the user by supplying a
username/password pair in the attempt to read/execute the resource for the
client.
<P>
The Windows NT File System (NTFS) allows Access Control Lists (ACLs) to be
assigned to files and directories. ACLs grant and/or deny access to the
associated file or directory by specific Windows NT user accounts, or
groups of users. When an Internet service attempts to read or execute a
file on behalf of a client request, the user account offered by the service
must have permission, as determined by the ACL associated with the file, to
read or execute the file, as appropriate. If the user account does not have
permission to access the file, the request fails, and a response is
returned, informing the client that access has been denied.
<P>
File and directory ACLs are configured using the Windows NT File Manager.
<P>
<P><h3>Anonymous Connections</h3>
 
<P>
An anonymous connection is processed when a client request does not contain
a username and password. This occurs in the following cases:

<UL><LI>An FTP client logs on with the username Anonymous.

<LI>All Gopher requests.
<P>
</UL>- A WWW (HTTP) request's headers do not contain a username and password.
<P>
Each Internet service maintains a Windows NT username and password to be
used for the processing of anonymous requests. When an anonymous request is
received, the service impersonates the user configured as the
anonymous-logon user. The request will succeed if the anonymous-logon user
has permission to access the requested resource, as determined by the
resource's ACL. For WWW only, if the user does not have permission to
access the resource, the response returned to the client contains a list of
supported authentication schemes for gaining access to the resource. See
below for more information.
<P>
The anonymous-logon user account can be viewed and modified on the
Service property page of the Internet Service Manager. Multiple Internet
Information Server services running on the same computer can use the same,
or different anonymous-logon user accounts. Including the 'anonymous
logon' user account in file or directory ACLs allows for precise control of
the resources available to 'anonymous' clients.
<P>
The anonymous-logon user account specified must be a valid Windows
NT user account on the server computer, and the password specified must
match the password for this user in the computer's user database. User
accounts and passwords are configured using the Windows NT User Manager.
<P>
When the Internet Information Server product is installed, Setup creates a
user account on the server computer to be used for anonymous connections.
The username of this account has the form IUSR_&lt;computer_name&gt;. For
example, if the server computer name is WEB1, the username created will be
IUSR_WEB1. The same anonymous-logon user account is set up for all Internet
Information Server services installed on the computer. The account is made
a member of the computer's Guest group. This will, in most cases, give
anonymous client requests access to public content published on the server.
Run the Control Panel/Network applet to see the computer name configured
for the Windows NT Server computer.
<P>
A randomly generated password is created for the IUSR_&lt;computer_name&gt;
account. For maximum convenience and security, we suggest that you change
the password associated with this account to a password that you will
remember, but is not easily guessed. To do this, you must specify the new
password for the account in User Manager, and on the Service page of the
Internet Service Manager for each Internet Information Server service
installed.
<P>
When the Internet Information Server is installed on a primary or secondary
domain controller, the anonymous-logon user account is created in the user
account database of the domain. When Internet Information Server is
installed on a domain member-server, or a stand-alone server, the account
is created on the local machine.
<P>
If Internet Information Server is installed on multiple domain controllers
of the same domain, a separate user account is created in the domain user
database for each Internet server computer. This does not cause any
conflicts since each username is unique, containing the name of the
associated computer.
<P>
However, you may find it more convenient to create a single
anonymous-logon user account in the domain to use for all Internet
Information Server domain controllers in the domain. This can simplify
administration of ACLs. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In User Manager, create a new anonymous-logon user account in the
   domain. Be sure that this account is made a member of appropriate
   groups, given a secure password, and is given the User Right (in the
   Policies menu) to Log On Locally.

<P><LI>On the Service property page of Internet Service Manager, specify the
   new anonymous-logon username and password. You must do this for each
   Internet Information Server service running on all primary and secondary
   domain controllers in the domain.

<P><LI>When later installing Internet Information Server on other domain
   controllers in the domain, be sure to use Internet Service Manager to
   modify the anonymous-logon username and password to match those created
   with User Manager. Do this for each Internet Information Server service
   installed.
<P>
</OL><h3>Client Requests Containing Credentials</h3>
 
<P>
A request containing credentials is one of the following:

<UL><LI>An FTP client logs on with a valid Windows NT username and password.
<P>
   This requires that the FTP service checkbox labled Allow Only Anonymous
   Connections be unchecked.
   WARNING: FTP sends passwords across the network in clear text.

<LI>A WWW (HTTP) request's headers contain a username and password.
<P>
   This is HTTP basic authentication. WARNING: HTTP basic authentication
   sends passwords across the network in clear text.

<LI>A WWW browser supports NTLM (Windows NT native) authentication, and an
   anonymous client request is denied access to a resource.
<P>
   In this case, the browser automatically sends the Windows client's
   username and password to the Internet Information Server Web server
   using the encrypted NTLM protocol. In this release, only the Internet
   Explorer 2.0 &amp; 3.0 for Windows 95 supports NTLM authentication.
<P>
</UL>When an Internet Information Server service receives a client request
that contains credentials (a username and password), the anonymous-logon
user account is not used in processing the request. Instead, the username
and password received by the client are used by the service. If the service
is not granted permission to access the requested resource while
impersonating the specified user, the request fails, and an error
notification is returned to the client.
<P>
For WWW (HTTP) only, when an anonymous request fails because the
anonymous-logon user account does not have permission to access the
desired resource, the response to the client indicates which authentication
schemes the service supports. This is determined by the configuration of
the WWW service authentication features. If the response indicates to the
client that the service is configured to support HTTP basic
authentication, most Web browsers will pop up a username/password dialog
box, and reissue the anonymous request as a request with credentials,
including the username and password entered by the user.
<P>
If a Web browser supports NTLM authentication, and the Web service is
configured to support NTLM authentication, an anonymous WWW request failing
due to permissions, will result in automatic use of the NTLM protocol to
send a username and encrypted password from the client to the service. The
client request will then be reprocessed, using the client's user
information. The user account obtained from the client is that with which
the user is logged into the client computer. As this account, including its
Windows NT domain, must be a valid account on the Web server machine, NTLM
authentication is most useful in an intranet environment, where the client
and server machines are in the same, or trusted domains. In this release,
Internet Explorer for Windows 95 is the only browser that supports NTLM
authentication.
<P>
<P><h3>Internet Service Manager Authentication Options</h3>
 
<P>
In addition to the anonymous-logon username and password fields, the
Internet Service Manager Service property page contains the following
authentication options:
<P>
For WWW:

<UL><LI>Allow Anonymous.
<P>
   When this check box is checked, anonymous connections are processed, and
   the anonymous-logon username/password are used for these connections.
   When this checkbox is unchecked, all anonymous connections are rejected.
   In this case, basic or NTLM authentication can be used to access
   content.

<LI>Basic.
<P>
   When this check box is checked, the Web service will process requests
   using basic authentication. WARNING: Basic authentication sends Windows
   NT usernames and passwords across the network without encryption. This
   checkbox is unchecked by default for security reasons.

<LI>Windows NT Challenge/Response.
<P>
   When this check box is checked, the service will honor requests by
   clients to send user account information using the Windows NT
   Challenge/Response (NTLM) protocol. This protocol uses encryption for
   secure transmission of passwords. The NTLM authentication process is
   initiated automatically as a result of an 'access denied' error on an
   anonymous client request. Currently, NTLM authentication only works
   with Internet Explorer 2.0 for Windows 95.
<P>
</UL>For FTP:

<UL><LI>Allow Anonymous Connections.
<P>
   When this check box is checked, FTP logons in which the user enters a
   username of 'anonymous' will be processed. These anonymous connections
   will be processed on behalf of the Windows NT user account specified on
   the Service property page. When this check box is unchecked, users will
   be required to enter valid Windows NT usernames and passwords to log
   on to the FTP service.

<LI>Allow only anonymous connections.
<P>
   When this checkbox is checked, user logons with a username other than
   anonymous will be rejected.
<P>
   WARNING: FTP User names and passwords are  sent across the network in
   clear text. When this check box is unchecked, Windows NT passwords will
   be sent to the server without encryption. This check box is checked by
   default for security reasons.
<P>
</UL><h3>Other Authentication Issues</h3>
 
<P>
SSL:
<P>
SSL is a WWW feature that supports data encryption and server
authentication. All data sent to or from the client using SSL is encrypted.
If HTTP basic authentication is used in conjunction with SSL, the username
and password are transmitted after being encrypted by the client's SSL
support. In this release, the only Web browser that supports SSL is
Internet Explorer 2.0, for Windows 95. See the Installation and Planning
Guide and online help for more information on SSL.
<P>
<PRE>'INTERACTIVE' and 'NETWORK' Users
</PRE></OL> 
<P>
If you use the predefined Windows NT user accounts 'INTERACTIVE' and
<PRE>'NETWORK' for access control, your use of these accounts may affect client
</PRE>access to some resources. In order for a file to be accessed by anonymous
client requests or client requests using basic authentication, the
requested file must be accessible by the INTERACTIVE user. In order for a
file to be accessible by a client request using NTLM authentication, the
file must be accessible by the NETWORK user.
<P>
<P><h3>Log On Locally User Right</h3>
 
<P>
In User Manager, when configuring a Windows NT user account to be used
either as the Internet Information Server anonymous-logon account, or as a
user account specified by client requests using HTTP basic authentication,
be sure that the user account is granted the 'Log on locally' user right.
This is specified in User Manager's Policies menu.
<P>
<P><h3>Customized Authentication</h3>
 
<P>
If you need a WWW request authentication scheme not supported by the
service directly, obtain a copy of the Internet Server API (ISAPI) Software
Developer's Kit (SDK), and read the ISAPI Filters specification on how to
develop user-written ISAPI Filter DLLs that handle request authentication.
