<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to modify or replace a file that is being called as a 
server-side Include, you may get a sharing violation. You also may 
not be able to delete, move, rename, or change this file until the 
World Wide Web (WWW) service is stopped.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Generally all files published by the World Wide Web Publishing service 
are shared, and can be updated at any time with no problem, even on a 
busy server. The exception is with server side includes. The file called 
by the server-side Include tag is mapped into memory and is not shareable.
This can prevent the file from being updated without stopping the WWW 
service.
<P>
Normally this is not a problem, but if the included file is used to 
display frequently changing information, then it would cause the WWW 
service to have to be stopped and started more often than normal.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
If you have dynamically changing data, you should not use a server-side 
Include to display the information from a file.
