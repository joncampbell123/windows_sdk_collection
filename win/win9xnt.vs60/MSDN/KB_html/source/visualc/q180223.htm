<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Jet database engine (the underlying engine used by DAO to
write and read to a Microsoft Access database file) uses a page buffer to
improve write and read performance. Because of this buffering activity, you
cannot accurately predict the time it will take for a write from one
process to be subsequently read by another process.
<P>
Every process that uses the Jet database engine maintains a private page
buffer, which makes synchronous write/read activity between two processes
difficult to achieve. For example, suppose you have two processes (Process
1 and Process 2) using the Jet database engine to write and read data to
and from the same database file. When Process 1 writes to the database, the
new data may not immediately get flushed to the physical database file.
When Process 2 reads from the database, it may be reading a data page in
the page buffer, rather that the new information written by Process 1.
<P>
So if Process 1 writes a record to the database and then signals Process 2
to read the same record, the read may occasionally fail due to the
independent buffers.
<P>
This article demonstrates how to optimize a DAO-based program so that
writes to a physical database and reads from a physical database are likely
to occur in a synchronous manner. Use the techniques described here to help
you obtain the best possible synchronous writing and reading performance
when using DAO.
<P>
<P><h3>Important Notes</h3>
 

<UL><LI>The techniques described in this article help ensure that writes and
   reads are performed synchronously. However, due to factors beyond the
   control of Jet, such as network and operating system latency, there is
   no way to guarantee such behavior. The Jet Engine was not designed to
   support ACID (Atomic, Concurrent, Independent, Durable) transactions and
   should not be used in any application environment where such
   transactions are required.

<LI>Because the Microsoft Access ODBC driver does not expose the
   functionality of the DAO SDK's Idle method, it is not possible to
   optimize ODBC-based programs for synchronous writing and reading.
<P>

<P><h2>Forcing a Write Using DAO</h2>
 
<P>
With the release of the Microsoft Jet 3.5 database engine, you can force a
write to the physical database file by using the dbForceOSFlush flag in
conjunction with a DAO workspace transaction. This functionality is
available to both the DAO 3.5 SDK and to the MFC DAO classes that ship with
Visual C++ 5.0. Calling the CommitTrans(dbForceOSFlush) method tells the
Microsoft Jet database engine to write the contents of the page buffer out
to the physical database file. All new information in the page buffer is
written out to the physical database file before the call to CommitTrans
returns.
<P>
<P><h3>Using DAO 3.5 SDK Code</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   CdbWorkspace wsDAO;
   ... Open DAO workspace and various
   ... DAO objects needed.
   // Start workspace transaction.
   wsDAO.BeginTrans();
   ... Write data to database using DAO
   ... objects opened under workspace ws.
   // Commit changes and force flush.
   wsDAO.CommitTrans( dbForceOSFlush );
   ... Send signal to Process 2 to READ data.

</PRE><h3>Using MFC DAO Code</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   CDaoWorkspace wsMFC;
   ... Open DAO workspace and various
   ... DAO objects needed.
   // Start transaction.
   wsMFC.BeginTrans();
   ... Write data to database using DAO
   ... objects opened under workspace ws.
   // Commit changes and force flush.
   wsMFC.m_pDAOWorkspace-&gt;CommitTrans( dbForceOSFlush );
   ... Send signal to Process 2 to READ data.

</PRE>Note the MFC DAO code above uses the underlying DAO workspace pointer to
call CommitTrans because the MFC DAO classes do not allow passing in the
dbForceOSFlush flag to the CDaoWorkspace CommitTrans method.
<P>
<P><h2>Forcing a Read Using DAO</h2>
 
<P>
With the release of the Microsoft Jet 3.5 database engine, you can force a
synchronous read from the physical database file by using the
dbRefreshCache flag in conjunction with the workspace Idle method. This
functionality is available to both the DAO 3.5 SDK and to the MFC DAO
classes that ship with Visual C++ 5.0.
<P>
Calling the Idle(dbRefreshCache) method tells the Microsoft Jet database
engine to completely refresh the page buffer with the current information
from the physical database file. All updated pages in the physical database
is pulled into the page buffer before the call to Idle returns.
<P>
<P><h3>Using DAO 3.5 SDK Code</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   CdbEngine engDAO;
   CdbWorkspace wsDAO;

   // Note: You must append workspace in order for
   // Idle to work for your workspace.
   wsDAO = engDAO.CreateWorkspace( _T("MyWS"), _T("Admin"),
                                   _T(""), dbUseJet );
   engDAO.Workspaces.Append( wsDAO );
   ... Open DAO database and various
   ... DAO objects using wsDAO workspace.

   ... Wait here for READ signal from Process 1.

   dbEngine.Idle( dbRefreshCache );
   ... Read data from process#1 here.

</PRE><h3>Using MFC DAO Code</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   CDaoWorkspace wsMFC;
   // Note: You must append workspace in order for
   // Idle to work for your workspace.
   wsMFC.Create( _T("MyWs"), _T("Admin"), _T("") );
   wsMFC.Append();
   ... Open DAO database and various
   ... DAO objects needed using workspace above

   ... Wait here for READ signal from Process 1.

   wsMFC.Idle( dbRefreshCache );
   ... Read data from Process 1 here.
