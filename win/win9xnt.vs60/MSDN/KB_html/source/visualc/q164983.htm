<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The MFC WinInet classes (CInternetSession, CInternetConnection, etc.) are
not designed to be used with asynchronous WinInet connections or file
transfer. Instead, developers looking for asynchronous-like behavior in
their MFC WinInet application should implement separate synchronous WinInet
sessions in secondary threads.
<P>
In the event that asynchronous WinInet using MFC is necessary, the
ASYNCGET sample demonstrates some techniques for manipulating the MFC
classes to do this.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A WinInet application creates an asynchronous WinInet session by using
INTERNET_FLAG_ASYNC in the last parameter of the CInternetSession
constructor, dwFlags.
<P>
Because some Internet operations may take a long period of time to
complete, it is often desirable to make asynchronous WinInet calls, which
return control to the application and run the operation in the background.
This allows the application's user interface to continue to function. In
addition, the application can display status updates on a lengthy download
or even allow the user to halt an operation while it is executing. In this
case, the recommended method for an MFC WinInet application is to not use
INTERNET_FLAG_ASYNC in constructing the CInternetSession. Instead, for
each necessary concurrent session, a secondary thread is spawned from the
main thread. Each secondary thread is responsible for creating a new
CInternetSession object without the INTERNET_FLAG_ASYNC flag and then
performing any needed operations on that synchronous session, such as
making an FTP connection and then downloading a file.
<P>
In some cases however, true asynchronous WinInet is really the desired
goal. If this is the case, developers are encouraged to abandon their use
of the MFC WinInet classes and make calls to the WinInet API directly. You
can get more information about this from the Internet Client SDK at:

</PRE>Ultimately, if it is absolutely necessary to program asynchronous WinInet
using the MFC classes, it is possible to do so. The ASYNCGET sample
demonstrates some of the necessary techniques in a simple FTP download
application. It also demonstrates some common methods for synchronizing
asynchronous events as well as how to mix direct WinInet calls with MFC
WinInet calls.
<P>
ASYNCGET is designed as a simple FTP file retrieval application. It
proceeds in two phases - the connection phase and the download phase. The
connection phase is a representation of an FTP connection; an FTP
connection involves transparently connecting to an FTP server and then
logging into that server. The download phase involves sending commands to
the FTP server to request a file and then receiving that file to the local
computer. In ASYNCGET, the download phase cannot begin until the
connection phase is completed. Just to be confusing, ASYNCGET also refers
to a "download" as the full process of proceeding through both phases.
ASYNCGET allows for the download of only one file at a time, even though
WinInet supports multiple concurrent downloads for some connection types.
In addition, functionality has been added which allows the user to halt at
any point in the download process.
<P>
Following is a list of the main problems that ASYNCGET addresses:

<UL><LI>All CXXXConnection constructors throw exceptions when async: The
   constructor for these objects throws an exception whenever any error
   returns from its call to InternetConnect, which invalidates the object.
   Unfortunately, all WinInet API use the error code ERROR_IO_PENDING to
   signal that an asynchronous operation is still in progress. Because the
   MFC classes don't take this into account, this constructor needs to be
   wrapped in an exception-handling try/catch block.

<LI>Connection handle not available immediately: Not only does the
   connection object die as described above, but also the proper handle
   that you need to use with the connection object isn't available until an
   asynchronous call is made back into the session's status-callback. The
   trick here is to handle INTERNET_STATUS_HANDLE_CREATED in the status-
   callback and use the handle passed there to create a whole new
   connection object with an alternative constructor.

<LI>MFC doesn't pass all status-callback notifications: The WinInet API
   often spawn off new handles for asynchronous operations above and beyond
   the original connection handle. Because MFC can only pass on status-
   callback notifications for handles that it knows about, notifications on
   these handles don't get passed through to
   CInternetSession::OnStatusCallback. The only alternative is to forego
   calling EnableStatusCallback and register your own status callback
   directly.

<LI>Synchronization issues: The majority of the complexity in ASYNCGET is
   due to the inherent complexity of asynchronous operations in general.
   For more information on this subject, refer to the WinInet docs in the
   ActiveX SDK. Specifically in ASYNCGET, it was necessary to implement a
   CEvent object to ensure that the INTERNET_STATUS_HANDLE_CREATED code for
   connecting to a server was completed before the
   INTERNET_STATUS_REQUEST_COMPLETE code attempted to download a file from
   that server. Also, because notifications may still come in for an
   operation that was terminated by the user, it is necessary to check for
   this case and prevent any wayward code from attempting to use a
   CFtpConnection object that is long dead.

<LI>Mixing synchronous and asynchronous calls: As the WinInet documentation
   indicates, passing 0 for dwContext to any WinInet API should force that
   call to be synchronous, even if the session was created with
   INTERNET_FLAG_ASYNC. Preprocessor definitions have been added to the
   sample to allow you to selectively turn on synchronous connections
   and/or file-downloads. These preprocessor definitions merely change the
   dwContext value either in the session object or for the get-file
   request. See the top of GetFileDlg.cpp for more information.
