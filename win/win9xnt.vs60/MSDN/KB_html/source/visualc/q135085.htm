The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.5, 1.51, 1.52
<LI>Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Foundation Classes included with the versions of Visual C++
listed at the beginning of this article do not provide any support for
creating OLE control containers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The OLE Control Development Kit (CDK) provides the ability to create
OLE controls which can be used in OLE control containers such as
Microsoft Visual FoxPro version 3.0 and Microsoft Access version 2.0.
However, current versions of MFC and Visual C++ do not provide any support
for creating OLE control containers.
<P>
The next major version of Visual C++, currently planned for release in the
fall of 1995, will provide support for creating OLE control containers.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
Here are sources of information regarding creating an OLE control
container:

<UL><LI>"Notes on Implementing an OLE Control Container"
<P>
   This article by Kraig Brockschmidt can be found on the Microsoft
   Developer Network CD (MSDN). It discusses the OLE control container
   architecture and provides sample code that illustrates how to
   implement an OLE control container.

<LI>"Implementing OLE Control Containers with MFC and the OLE Control
   Developer's Kit"
<P>
   This article by Mike Blaszczak can be found on the MSDN CD and in the
   April 1995 issue of the "Microsoft Systems Journal." It discusses
   different types of OLE control container support and provides sample
   code for an OLE control container.

<LI>"CONTROLS: Demonstrates How to Test OLE Controls"
<P>
   This article can be found on the MSDN CD and in the February 1995 issue
   of the Microsoft Systems Journal. It includes a sample application
   that implements a version of the MFC DRAWCLI sample that has been
   modified to provide OLE control containment.
<P>
</UL>These articles and samples provide very useful information regarding
creating OLE control containers. However, because the current versions of
Visual C++ and MFC do not provide any support for creating OLE control
containers, these samples are provided as is, with no additional support.
<P>
Microsoft Developer Support does not currently provide any support for the
creation or implementation of OLE control containers. Because the next
major version of Visual C++ will provide a fully supported OLE control
container implementation, Microsoft recommends that developers wait for
this release unless they have an immediate need for OLE control
containment.
