<P>
Q. Why is the put_Font or putref_Font method not called when an ActiveX
control's Font property is changed by the ActiveX Control Pad?
<P>
A. The put_Font or putref_Font method is called only when you completely
replace your control's Font object with a new one. When you change the font
in the ActiveX Control Pad, get_Font is called to get a pointer to the Font
object for the ActiveX Control Pad. Changes made by the Control Pad are
made directly to that object. The ActiveX Control Pad does not create a new
Font object and assign it to your Font property.
<P>
The following example demonstrates the case where the font property is
changed without calling the put_Font or putref_Font method:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;object CLASSID="clsid:E882D673-878E-11D0-B00C-000000000000"
    id="FontTest1"&gt;
   &lt;/object&gt;
   &lt;object CLASSID="clsid:E882D673-878E-11D0-B00C-000000000000"
    id="FontTest2"&gt;
   &lt;/object&gt;
   &lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="VBScript"&gt;
   &lt;!--
   Sub Window_OnLoad

   FontTest1.Font.Name = "times new roman"
   FontTest1.Font.Size = 16
   FontTest2.Font = FontTest1.Font

   End Sub
   --&gt;
   &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;

</PRE></OL> 
<P>
Q. How do I get the &lt;PARAM&gt; tag to work with an ATL control?
<P>
A. You need to support the IPersistPropertyBag interface for the HTML
&lt;PARAM&gt; tag to work with your ATL control. An implementation of this
interface is supplied in the IPersistPropertyBagImpl class that comes with
ATL 2.1. The CIRC sample demonstrates how to support IPersistPropertyBag
and add your properties to the property map.
<P>
 
Q. What are the reasons an ATL server might fail to register?
<P>
A. The following are the top three reasons an ATL server might fail to
register:

<OL><P><LI>You built your project with _WIN32_WINNT=0x400 (the default), and you
   are not running the ATL server under Windows NT 4.0 or you do not have
   an up-to-date version of Oleaut32.dll. To solve this problem, run
   "DUMPBIN /EXPORTS OLEAUT32.DLL" and search for UnregisterTypelib. If it
   is not there, then your server cannot run. Remove this #define statement
   from Stdafx.h if you want to run the ATL server under Windows 95 or
   older versions of Windows NT. Alternatively, you can use LoadLibrary and
   GetProcAddress so that you can run optimally under both Windows 95 and
   Windows NT 4.0. The Oleaut32.dll that ships with the Internet Explorer
   3.x is up-to-date.

<P><LI>You built your project as MinSize and Atl.dll is not properly installed
   on the system. The correct version of Atl.dll must be copied and
   registered by Regsvr32. There are Windows NT and Windows 95 versions of
   Atl.dll. The Windows 95 version runs under Windows NT. However, since it
   does not use the UNICODE APIs, it is slightly less efficient. Unless you
   build your project as MinDependency, you will need to install the
   correct version of Atl.dll and run Regsvr32 on it before you install
   your server.

<P><LI>You built your project as UNICODE, and you cannot run it under
   Windows 95.
<P>
</OL>The following are the steps to troubleshoot:

<OL><P><LI>For a DLL server, run Regsvr32 in the debugger. Open the Project
   Settings dialog box and click the Debug tab. In the Executable for debug
   session text box, enter the full path to Regsvr32.exe, such as
   C:\Sharedide\Bin\Regsvr32.exe. In the Program arguments text box,
   specify the full path to your DLL, such as
   C:\Myprojects\Foo\Debug\Foo.dll. Set a breakpoint at DllRegisterServer
   and start stepping.

<P><LI>For an EXE server, run it in the debugger and specify /REGSVR as its
   command-line argument.
<P>
</OL> 
<P>
Q. What problems might be encountered when using _ATL_MIN_CRT? What causes
the linker error that _main is unresolved during Release builds?
<P>
A. This usually happens when the C Run-Time (CRT) startup code is required
for some CRT functions. You can either remove all references to the CRT
functions that require the startup code or remove the _ATL_MIN_CRT
preprocessor definition from your compiler settings.
<P>
You can link statically or dynamically to the CRT. Statically linking
causes the CRT code to be placed in your executable image and you do not
need to have the CRT DLL (Msvcrt.dll). If you dynamically link to the CRT,
references to the code in Msvcrt.dll are placed in your image. For your
image to run, Msvcrt.dll must be present. Even when dynamically linking to
the CRT, there can still be some code statically linked, such as
DllMainCRTStartup.
<P>
An entry point, explicitly or implicitly specified when linking, is called
by the operating system after loading the image. For a DLL, the default
entry point is DllMainCRTStartup. For an EXE, it is WinMainCRTStartup. You
can override the default with the /ENTRY linker option. The CRT provides an
implementation for DllMainCRTStartup, WinMainCRTStartup, and
wWinMainCRTStartup (UNICODE entry point for an EXE). These entry points
(CRT startup code) call constructors on global objects and initialize some
data structures used by some CRT functions. This startup code adds about
25K to your image when statically linking.
<P>
Some CRT functions can be used without the CRT startup code, for example,
functions with the mem prefix, wcslen, wcscmp, and strlen. The following
require the CRT startup code:

<UL><LI>String comparison routines
<LI>Memory allocation routines
<LI>Global objects with constructors
<LI>C++ exception handling (/GX)
<P>
</UL>ATL is aimed at minimizing the image size and the reliance on run-time
DLLs. It provides alternative implementations for common CRT APIs that
would otherwise require the CRT startup code. The use of these APIs is
controlled by the _ATL_MIN_CRT macro. Using _ATL_MIN_CRT does not mean that
you cannot use the CRT routines. However, if you use the routines that
require the CRT startup code, then you will get a linker error that _main
is unresolved. Providing your own implementation of _main does not solve
this problem.
<P>
If C++ exceptions (/GX) are enabled, then you must link in the startup
code. The _ATL_MIN_CRT macro cannot be used in this case. MFC requires code
to be compiled with the /GX option. Therefore, you cannot use _ATL_MIN_CRT
in conjunction with MFC. You can use SEH (structured exception handling),
__try, and __except with _ATL_MIN_CRT, because the startup code is not
required. In many cases, since most of the CRT source code ships with the
product, you can use some of this code and replace only parts of it with
system calls to avoid the startup code.
<P>
To find out what is causing the problem, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Open the Project Settings dialog box, select the Link tab, and click
   Input in the Category box. Type LIBCMT.LIB in the Ignore libraries
   text box. Now do a build. You will get a list of unresolved externals.
   This list contains the CRT routines you are using. Look for the routines
   that you think may require the startup code.

<LI>Turn on the /VERBOSE linker option. From the resulting linker output,
   you can find a list of routines that require the CRT startup code.
<P>
</UL>If you need the startup code, then remove the _ATL_MIN_CRT definition from
the Project Settings. You can also dynamically link to CRT. This reduces
your image size but requires Msvcrt.dll.
<P>
When building as Release, the default option is to statically link to CRT
and use _ATL_MIN_CRT. This gives a smaller image size than dynamically
linking to CRT, at least when the startup code is avoided and the CRT APIs
used by AppWizard are used.
<P>
 
<P>
Q. How do I update the CLSID registry key under a version-independent
ProgID? Or, why is CLSIDFromProgID failing when passing a version
independent ProgID?
<P>
A. Using the CLSIDFromProgID function fails when you pass a version
independent ProgID with only a CurVer key. To make it work, you need to add
the CLSID key under the version-independent ProgID.
<P>
If in your .RGS file, you have:
<P>
<PRE>   TriBrowseObj.TriBrowseObj.1 = s 'TriBrowseObj Class'
   {
         CLSID = s '{3452E30B-8B87-11D0-A671-00A0C903977C}'
   }
   TriBrowseObj.TriBrowseObj = s 'TriBrowseObj Class'
   {
         CurVer = s 'TriBrowseObj.TriBrowseObj.1'
   }

</PRE></OL>you must change it to:
<P>
<PRE>   TriBrowseObj.TriBrowseObj.1 = s 'TriBrowseObj Class'
   {
           CLSID = s '{3452E30B-8B87-11D0-A671-00A0C903977C}'
   }
   TriBrowseObj.TriBrowseObj = s 'TriBrowseObj Class'
   {
           CLSID = s '{3452E30B-8B87-11D0-A671-00A0C903977C}'
           CurVer = s 'TriBrowseObj.TriBrowseObj.1'
   }

</PRE>To fix this problem for the future, modify the wizard template (.rgs) in
the following directory:

<UL><LI>For Visual C++ 4.x: \Msdev\Template\Atl
<LI>For Visual C++ 5.0: \Devstudio\Sharedide\Template\Atl
<P>
</UL>Change the Control.rgs file and any other .rgs files that are wrong. The
following statements:
<P>
<PRE>  [!ProgID] = s '[!TypeName]'
  {
   CLSID = s '{[!ObjectGUID]}'
</PRE>[!if=(InsertableEnabled, "TRUE")]
<PRE>   'Insertable'
</PRE>[!endif]
<PRE>  }
</PRE>[!VersionIndependentProgID] = s '[!TypeName]'
<PRE>  {
   CurVer = s '[!ProgID]'
  }

</PRE>should be changed to:
<P>
<PRE>   [!ProgID] = s '[!TypeName]'
   {
     CLSID = s '{[!ObjectGUID]}'
</PRE>[!if=(InsertableEnabled, "TRUE")]
<PRE>    'Insertable'
</PRE>[!endif]
<PRE>   }
   [!VersionIndependentProgID] = s '[!TypeName]'
   {
     CLSID = s '{[!ObjectGUID]}'
     CurVer = s '[!ProgID]'
   }

</PRE> 
<P>
Q. What are the known problems with the ATL 2.0 Object Wizard?
<P>
A. The ATL 2.0 Object Wizard might not be present in the Component Gallery.
The ATL 2.0 Object Wizard is not installed by the main ATL 2.0 setup
program (Atlinst.exe). It requires a separate setup program. You need to
download and run the ATL 2.0 Object Wizard Technology Preview (Objinst.exe)
from the ATL Web page. There is a separate ZIP file for Windows NT 3.51.
<P>
The ATL 2.0 Object Wizard may crash if an older version of Oleaut32.dll is
installed on the system. Make sure the version of Oleaut32.dll is at least
2.20.4049. The latest version is available for download at the Internet
Explorer 3.x Web site. If this does not fix the problem, then install
Service Pack 2 for Windows NT 4.0.
<P>
 
<P>
Q. What DLLs do I need to ship with my control?
<P>
A. If you build your control with the MinDependency option, the resulting
DLL (or EXE) is completely self contained. The control relies only on
standard system DLLs such as Kernel32, User32, Gdi32, Ole32, Oleaut32, and
Advapi32. You need to distribute another DLL only when you build a
proxy/stub DLL that is not a part of your server DLL.
<P>
If you build with the MinSize option, you are required to ship only Atl.dll
with your control. You should statically link to the C Run-Time (CRT)
Libraries. In case you do not need the CRT startup code, and with minimal
use of the CRT, statically linking to the CRT produces a smaller image size
than dynamically linking.
<P>
 
<P>
Q. What changes does a control need to run in the Visual Basic 5.0 Control
Creation Edition?
<P>
A. If your control supports connection points and the IQuickActivate
interface, then it must support the IPropertyNotifySink connection point
for Visual Basic 5.0. To support the IPropertyNotifySink connection point,
add the following to the inheritance list:
<P>
<PRE>   public IPropertyNotifySinkCP&lt;CYourControlName&gt;

</PRE>And add the following to your connection point map:
<P>
<PRE>   CONNECTION_POINT_ENTRY(IID_IPropertyNotifySink)

</PRE> 
<P>
Q. What changes does a control need to run in an MFC 4.2b container?
<P>
A. There is a problem with MFC 4.2b in setting up the event sink when the
IQuickActivate interface is used. The workaround is to comment out the
following line in your interface map:
<P>
<PRE>   COM_INTERFACE_ENTRY_IMPL(IQuickActivate)

</PRE>You can also remove the following line from your inheritance list:
<P>
<PRE>   public IQuickActivateImpl&lt;CYourControlName&gt;

</PRE> 
<P>
Q. Why do I get exceptions when debugging my control? What do they mean?
<P>
A. Running the debugger in an environment that supports Structured
Exception Handling (SEH), like Windows NT, may produce exceptions like the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   First-chance exception in MY.OCX (KERNEL32.DLL): 0xC0000005:
   Access Violation.

</PRE>These exceptions occur at a lower level in the system than your control.
For more information, see the Microsoft Knowledge Base article: <B><A href="../win32sdk/q105675.htm">Q105675</A></B>.
<P>
 
<P>
Q. Why doesn't the container use my connection point interface?
<P>
A. Make sure your outgoing interface is not defined as a dual interface. If
the connection point specifies an outgoing interface as a dual interface,
most containers are not able to create a sink object to connect to that
connection point. Containers that provide connection sinks for COM objects
have to dynamically create those sinks. If you specify a dual interface, it
would be possible for events to be fired using the IDispatch part of the
dual interface. It is also possible that the COM object fires events
through the custom or v-table part of the dual interface that is not
implemented by most containers. Therefore, most containers protect against
hooking up a connection to a dual interface. The alternative is to use a
dispinterface. Containers such as Visual Basic 5.0 and Internet Explorer
only allows a dispinterface to be connected.
<P>
If you implement both the sink and the source, then it is recommended that
you use a dual interface for connection points. See the ATL Connect sample
for more information.
