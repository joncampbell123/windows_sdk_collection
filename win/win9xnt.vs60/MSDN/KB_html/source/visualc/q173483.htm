<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Visual C++ 5.0 custom AppWizards always generates an MFC-based project
initially. Now the custom AppWizards can change the essential MFC project
settings for the generated project through the new automation object model
of Developer Studio.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a custom AppWizard generates a project, it cannot simply replace the
automatically created .dsp project settings file. The project settings in
the .dsp file are set by internal rules that assume all generated projects
are MFC projects. However, Visual C++ 5.0's new object model allows custom
AppWizards to modify tool settings such that all dependencies on MFC are
removed from the resulting project.
<P>
The CCustomAppWiz class in Visual C++ 5.0 now has a virtual override called
CustomizeProject. CustomizeProject provides the custom wizard with an
IBuildProject interface. The Configurations method of IBuildProject
provides an IConfiguration interface for each build configuration in the
project. IConfiguration can add and remove settings supplied to tools such
as the compiler. Using these methods, a custom wizard can remove settings
that add dependencies on MFC.
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Code</h3>
 
<P>
Following is an example CustomizeProject override that demonstrates the
removal of MFC dependencies:
<P>
<PRE>   #import "c:\Program Files\DevStudio\SharedIDE\bin\ide\devbld.pkg"

   void CNoMfcCustWizAppWiz::CustomizeProject(IBuildProject* pProject)
   {
   using namespace DSProjectSystem;

      long lNumConfigs;
      IConfigurationsPtr pConfigs;
      IBuildProjectPtr pProj;
      // Needed to convert IBuildProject to the DSProjectSystem namespace
      pProj.Attach((DSProjectSystem::IBuildProject*)pProject, true);

      pProj-&gt;get_Configurations(&amp;pConfigs);
      pConfigs-&gt;get_Count(&amp;lNumConfigs);
      //Get each individual configuration
      for (long j = 1 ; j &lt; lNumConfigs+1 ; j++)
      {
         _bstr_t varTool;
         _bstr_t varSwitch;
         IConfigurationPtr pConfig;
         _variant_t varj = j;

         pConfig = pConfigs-&gt;Item(varj);

         // Remove Preprocessor def for MFC DLL specifier, _AFXDLL
         varTool   = "cl.exe";
         varSwitch = "/D \"_AFXDLL\"";
         pConfig-&gt;RemoveToolSettings(varTool, varSwitch, varj);

         varTool   = "rc.exe";
         varSwitch = "/d \"_AFXDLL\"";
         pConfig-&gt;RemoveToolSettings(varTool, varSwitch, varj);

         // OPTIONAL
         // Add Libs that MFC headers would have pulled in automatically
         // Feel free to customize this listing to your tastes
         varTool = "link.exe";
         varSwitch = "kernel32.lib user32.lib gdi32.lib winspool.lib "
                     "comdlg32.lib advapi32.lib shell32.lib ole32.lib "
                     "oleaut32.lib uuid.lib odbc32.lib odbccp32.lib";
         pConfig-&gt;AddToolSettings(varTool, varSwitch, varj);
      }
   }

</PRE>Note that this code sample uses features from Visual C++ 5.0's new COM
compiler support. The #import statement imports and creates definitions for
all of the types in the DEVBLD.PKG type library. This allows the code to
use the COM smart pointers of the form IInterfacePtr, as well as the new
_bstr_t and _variant_t types. All of these new types automatically clean up
used memory and release held interface pointers when they go out of scope.
Refer to the Visual C++ documentation for more information.
<P>
<P><h3>Caveats</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Note that there is no programmatic method available for removing the
   internal project setting that controls the "Microsoft Foundation
   Classes" setting on the General Project Settings tab. Projects that are
   generated by custom wizards that include the code above will still
   appear to "Use MFC in a Shared DLL." The only way you can change this
   setting is by making unsupported modifications to the .dsp project
   settings file. However, this setting is only used by certain DevStudio
   MFC user interface elements, such as Class Wizard and some MFC-based
   component gallery components. It should have no effect on a non-MFC
   project.

<LI>Even after modifying project settings using AddToolSettings and
   RemoveToolSettings as above, DEFAULT project settings will still remain
   the same. If the user of a project generated by this custom AppWizard
   opens up Project Settings and clicks Reset, the restored
   project settings will include the removed MFC references. Again, the
   only way to prevent this is to make unsupported changes to the generated
   .dsp project settings file by hand after the custom AppWizard has
   created the project.

<LI>When you use RemoveToolSettings, remove only one tool setting at a time.
   In the example above, make another call to RemoveToolSettings to remove
   another preprocessor definition from the CL.EXE command line rather
   than tacking the definition to be removed onto the end of the same
   varSwitch statement. Also, keep in mind that tool settings are case-
   sensitive, that is "/d" and "/D" are not the same thing.

<LI>Unfortunately, AddToolSettings, RemoveToolSettings, and
   AddCustomBuildStep (another IConfiguration method) operate on the entire
   project only; they cannot make tool settings or create custom build
   steps for a single file. For example, it is usually desirable to add a
   custom build step for a project's IDL file to process the file using
   MIDL and generate TLB and other necessary project files. The current
   DevStudio object model does not support this. Custom build steps for
   single files will have to be added by hand after the custom AppWizard
   generates the projects.
