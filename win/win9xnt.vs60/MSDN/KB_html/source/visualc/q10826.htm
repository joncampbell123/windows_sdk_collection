The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft C for MS-DOS, versions 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0ax
<LI>Microsoft C/C++ for MS-DOS, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.0 and 1.5
</UL> 
<P>
You cannot develop a complete device driver only in C or C++. You must
write some assembly code and you cannot use the majority of functions
in the C run-time library.
<P>
The three major problems that occur when you develop a device driver
in C are as follows:

<UL><LI>The .EXE file loader is in COMMAND.COM which is not available when
   MS-DOS loads a device driver. Therefore, a device driver must be
   the binary image of a single-segment program. Microsoft C/C++
   version 7.0 introduced the ability to generate code in the tiny
   memory model in which the application stores its code and data in
   one memory segment.

<LI>The C run-time initialization code requires an appropriate PSP
   (program segment prefix) and requires MS-DOS to be available. Even
   though the source code to the startup code is provided with the C
   compiler, most of the startup code is in assembler and would
   require major modifications to be useful in a driver.

<LI>The entry-exit sequences used by C functions are inappropriate for
   use in an MS-DOS driver.
<P>
</UL>You can work around some of these limitations by using the C compiler
to generate assembly code. The -Fa switch directs the compiler to
produce an assembly code listing that you can edit and use as part of
the driver source code. Depending on the complexity of the MS-DOS
device driver, you could write most of the driver in C and modify and
maintain the code relatively easily.
