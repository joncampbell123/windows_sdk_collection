The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE) included with
   - Microsoft C for MS-DOS, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0ax
   - Microsoft C/C++ for MS-DOS, version 7.0
   - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.5
   - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 4.0, 4.1,
<P><PRE>     5.0
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
<P>
The Microsoft C/C++ compilers listed above may fail to detect a constant
expression that will cause a divide-by-zero error.  In these situations,
the Microsoft C compiler version 6.xx may ignore the error entirely and
instead use the value zero for the expression.  The Microsoft C/C++
compiler version 7.0 and those included with all versions of Visual C++ may
not generate an error at compile-time, but the resulting application should
produce a run-time error, either on the command line as
<P>
<PRE>   error R6003: integer divide by 0

</PRE>or in an Application Error message window (dialog box) with the text
<P>
<PRE>   The exception Integer division by zero
   (&lt;hex value&gt;) occurred in the application at location &lt;hex address&gt;.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft C Compiler version 6.xx does not correctly handle constant
propagation in all cases where optimizations are performed.  Thus, when it
evaluates constant expressions, it may not detect a divide-by-zero error,
but instead use zero as the result of the expression.  This, in turn,
precludes any run-time errors.
<P>
The Microsoft C/C++ compiler version 7.0 and those included with all
versions of Visual C++ handle the evaluation of constant expressions
differently than does the Microsoft C Compiler version 6.xx.  Although it
may not detect a divide-by-zero error, it doesn't necessarily perform
constant propagation for expressions depending upon a division operation.
This allows the operation to be executed at run-time and the divide-by-zero
error to be trapped.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around the problem in C 6.0, you must declare the code in such a
way as to disable the constant propagation optimization of the
compiler. This will ensure that the division takes place at run
time and then the divide-by-zero interrupt may occur. The following
are methods to do this:

<UL><LI>Use /Od to disable all optimizations.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use the optimize pragma to turn off "c" optimization.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Compile with the /qc (quick compile) option.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Declare any variable that will become a divisor as "volatile."
<P>
</UL>To work around the problem with all compilers listed above, you should

<UL><LI>redefine your code such that zero is never used as a denominator.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>provide in-code checks for denominators that equal zero such that
   afflicted expressions may be avoided.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Because dividing by 0 (zero) results in an undefined value, the Intel chip
issues a specific interrupt (Int 0) to trap this error.  This interrupt
can, in turn, be processed by an application in an appropriate manner.  By
default, the Microsoft run-time libraries install an interrupt handler.
When interrupted by a divide-by-zero error, this handler either writes a
message to stdout or activates an Application Error message box and then,
in both cases, terminates the program.
<P>
When an expression in a source file can be evaluated to a constant, the
compiler may "precalculate" the value and then, at run time, the result is
simply loaded into the destination.  This process is called "constant
propagation."  Because this constant propagation performed by the compiler
handles the evaluation of the expression at compile time, the generated
code does not contain any arithmetic instructions for that particular
expression.  Instead, the generated code just contains an instruction to
load the result.
<P>
In the case where an expression can be predetermined to cause a divide-by-
zero error (because a divisor evaluates to zero), the compiler should trap
the error during compilation of the source module and generate the
following error:
<P>
<PRE>   error C2124: divide or mod by zero

</PRE>This is important because the elimination of the division from the
generated code means that a run-time error will not be generated.
<P>
The Microsoft C Compiler version 6.xx may not generate the C2124 error.
This means that a divide-by-zero error may be occurring which is not
detected at compile time, and the optimization prevents it from being
detected at run time. Instead, the compiler uses the value zero as the
result.
<P>
The program example below illustrates this problem.  The Microsoft C
Compiler version 6.xx generates code to load a zero at run time instead of
generating an error message indicating that a possible division by zero is
going to be performed.  As described above, this also prevents a R6003
error from being generated at run time.  The Microsoft C/C++ compiler
version 7.0 and all versions included with Visual C++ generate code that
performs a division by zero at run-time.  The error is trapped and the user
is informed appropriately.
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Code</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   /* Compile options needed: none
   */

   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void main( void)
   {
      int a = 5;
      int b = 0;            // Declare as volatile for workaround

      a = a / b;

      printf( "a/b = %d\n", a);
   }
