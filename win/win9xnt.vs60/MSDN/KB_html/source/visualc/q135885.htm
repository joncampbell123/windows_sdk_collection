The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) included with:
   Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.51, 1.52
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
AppStudio provides support for placing .vbx controls on a dialog template
at design time. AppStudio also gives you the ability to set the properties
of a .vbx control that is placed on a dialog template. However, a dialog
template will not work for creating a .vbx control on a window that is not
based on a dialog, and if you don't know which .vbx control you will be
creating until run time, a dialog template will not suffice. In these
situations, you need to create the .vbx control at run time by using the
CVBControl::Create function. This article discusses approaches to use in
initializing a .vbx control that is created at run time.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Explicitly Setting the Properties</h3>
 
<P>
The simplest way to initialize the .vbx control is to explicitly set all of
the properties of the .vbx control after it has been created. To do this,
use the SetNumProperty, SetStringProperty, SetFloatProperty, and
SetPictureProperty functions.
<P>
This approach can be laborious, but there are two big advantages. One
advantage is that the initial values for the .vbx control will then be
clearly documented at the point in code where the .vbx control has been
created. Another advantage is portability to different versions of the .vbx
control. While a .vbx control should always maintain backwards
compatibility (and most do), a different version of a .vbx control might
not be completely compatible with the binary initialization information
used in the other initialization techniques.
<P>
<P><h3>Using a "Proxy" Dialog Template</h3>
 
<P>
Another way to initialize a dynamically-created .vbx control is to use a
"proxy" dialog template. This is done by creating a dialog template to hold
the .vbx control and its initial properties. The .vbx control on the
template has the same ID as the nID parameter you use to create the .vbx
control at run time using the CVBControl::Create function.
<P>
To have this proxy template behave just as the control would behave when it
is created on a dialog, you have to actually create the control using the
::CreateWindow function. This is how a control is normally created. The use
of this proxy template is made possible by the CWnd member function
ExecuteDlgInit. This function can be called for any CWnd window not just
dialogs, and it is this function that reads the initialization information
from the dialog resource and initializes the .vbx control.
<P>
Here are the explicit steps necessary to use this technique:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new dialog template using AppStudio. For this example, give it
   the ID of IDD_VBX_PROXY1.

<P><LI>Place the desired .vbx control on the dialog template and set the
   properties to the desired initial values. For this example, give the
   .vbx control the ID of IDC_MYVBX1.

<P><LI>Create the .vbx control just as the dialog manager would. By examining
   any .RC file you will see that a .vbx control is first created as a
   custom control of class type VBControl. This is what the ::CreateWindow
   call would look like:
<P>
   ::CreateWindow("VBControl","GRID.VBX;Grid;Grid1",
<P><PRE>      WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE | WS_CLIPSIBLINGS | WS_BORDER |
      WS_TABSTOP,
<PRE></PRE>           x, y, width, height,
      m_hWnd,  // This would be the parent window
      (HMENU) IDC_MYVBX1,
       AfxGetInstanceHandle(),
      NULL);

</PRE><P><LI>After the call to create the .vbx control, call the ExecuteDlgInit
   function, passing it the ID of the proxy template (IDD_VBX_PROXY1). For
   example:
<P>
<PRE>   // Create a .vbx control on a non-CFormView view

   void CMyView::OnInitialUpdate()
     {
       CView::OnInitialUpdate();

       ::CreateWindow("VBControl","GRID.VBX;Grid;Grid1",
    WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE | WS_CLIPSIBLINGS | WS_BORDER | WS_TABSTOP,
         x, y, width, height,
         m_hWnd,  // This would be the parent window
         (HMENU) IDC_MYVBX1,
         AfxGetInstanceHandle(),
         NULL);

       ExecuteDlgInit(IDD_VBX_PROXY1);
     };

</PRE></OL><h3>Using the CFile Parameter Of the Create Function</h3>
 
<P>
The last argument to the CVBControl::Create function is a pointer to a
CFile object (CFile *). The documentation states that more information can
be obtained about this parameter from MFC TechNote #27. While MFC TechNote
#27 does contain valuable information about .vbx controls and .vbx
initialization the specific format of this CFile object is not given.
<P>
The CFile object can be a pointer to a true file, but if you were to use
this parameter, you would most likely use a CMemFile.
<P>
The format of the binary data contained in the CFile object is identical to
the .vbx control information contained in the RT_DLGINIT binary resource
created by AppStudio. The format of this resource is documented in MFC
TechNote #24. The information that applies to a .vbx control is contained
in this technote under the section titled "VBX Control Data."
<P>
So a proper use of the CFile pointer parameter would be to construct a
CMemFile object, and fill it with the binary data as documented in the "VBX
Control Data" section of the TechNote.
<P>
Examination of the control data format will reveal that you need to know
the property index values of all your .vbx control's properties to
initialize the .vbx control. If the property index values are documented
for your .vbx control, you could use this format. If they are not
documented, you can obtain them with a test program that uses the
GetNumProps and GetPropName member functions of CVBControl.
<P>
Clearly this technique is not simple, and this is why the documentation for
the CVBControl::Create function states that you will normally be passing
NULL for the pFile parameter.
<P>
Note that because the binary initialization data is basically the same as
that contained in the RT_DLGINIT resource, you could again create a proxy
dialog template, load the binary resource (LoadResource), grab the portion
that contains the .vbx initialization data, copy this data to a CMemFile
object, and then use this CMemFile in your call to CVBControl::Create.
However this would have the same effect as using the "proxy" template
method listed above, and it would require a lot more work and code overhead
than simply using CreateWindow and the ExecuteDlgInit function.
