   DYNAVIEW.CPP    - Defines CDynaRecordView
   ENROLL          - Modified ENROLL Step 3 sample that
                     demonstrates how the code can be used.

</PRE>To successfully use this code, you must have:

<UL><LI>An ODBC driver that supports keyset-driven cursors and SQLSetPos()
   functionality (see below for more information)

<P>
</UL>NOTE: The file must be decompressed by typing "DYNSET.EXE -d".

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>What Is a Dynaset?</h3>
 
<P>
The Visual C++ MFC Encyclopedia in the books online states the following:
<P>
<PRE>   A dynaset is a recordset with dynamic properties. During its lifetime, a
   recordset object in dynaset mode (usually called simply a "dynaset")
   stays synchronized with the data source in the following way. In a
   multiuser environment, other users may edit or delete records that are
   in your dynaset or add records to the table your dynaset represents.
   Records your application updates or deletes from the recordset are
   reflected in your dynaset. Records that other users add to the table
   will not be reflected in your dynaset until you rebuild the dynaset by
   calling its Requery member function. Records that other users delete
   appear as "holes" in your recordset, marked as "deleted." Other users'
   editing changes to existing records are reflected in your dynaset as
   soon as you scroll to the affected record.

   Similarly, edits you make to records in a dynaset are reflected in
   dynasets in use by other users. Records you add are not reflected in
   other users' dynasets until they requery their dynasets. Records you
   delete are marked as "deleted" in others' recordsets. If you have
   multiple connections to the same database (multiple CDatabase objects),
   recordsets associated with those connections have the same status as the
   recordsets of other users. Dynasets are most valuable when data must be
   dynamic, as for an airline reservation system.

</PRE><h3>What Are the Advantages Of Using Dynasets?</h3>
 
<P>
As mentioned above, dynaset recordsets read directly from the data source
for each record fetched in the recordset. Therefore the record can change
values between subsequent fetches. There are two additional big advantages
which dynasets provide: speed and decreased memory usage. By not using
snapshots and using dynasets instead, you don't load the cursor library
(ODBCCURS.DLL). The cursor library reads each record for a recordset and
stores it into memory as you traverse through the records. Thus, it saves
the data for that moment in time. This can slow application performance.
The cursor library creates temporary files, which are used for storing the
temporary records. This uses more memory and disk space which you wouldn't
use if you use dynasets. Lastly, the cursor library traps ODBC API calls
before they are sent to the driver and this can slow an application.
<P>
<P><h3>What Are the Requirements for Using Dynasets?</h3>
 
<P>
Not all ODBC drivers support MFC dynasets. For example, the ODBC drivers
included with Visual C++ version 1.5, 1.51, and 1.52 do not support
dynasets. If you use the ODBC drivers provided with the ODBC 2.0 Desktop
Driver Pack and the code provided with this sample, you can utilize
dynasets for the desktop drivers (Microsoft Access 2.0, FoxPro, and so
forth).
<P>
When using this code, it is important that your ODBC driver support
the following:

<UL><LI>Keyset driven cursors
<LI>SQLSetPos() ODBC 2.0 functionality - SQL_POS_UPDATE, SQL_POS_DELETE,
   and SQL_POS_ADD
<P>
</UL>Look at the CDynaRecordset::OnSetOptions() function in DYNACORE.CPP to see
the SQLGetInfo() calls that are used to determine if a driver supports MFC
dynasets. Specifically, SQL_SO_KEYSET_DRIVEN and SQL_POS_OPERATIONS
functionality is checked. If SQL_POS_OPERATIONS isn't supported by the
driver, the dynaset can not be modified and therefore will be read-only.
<P>
Look at the help file or other documentation for the ODBC driver you're
using to discover whether it supports the items mentioned above.
<P>
Note, the ODBC drivers that come with Visual C++ 1.5 and 1.51 don't support
SQLSetPos(). You must be using the ODBC drivers provided with the ODBC 2.0
Driver pack, or something newer.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Use the Code</h3>
 
<P>
A modified version of the ENROLL Step 3 tutorial sample is provided. It
demonstrates how to use the dynaset code. To use the code do the following:

<UL><LI>Replace all references to "CRecordset" in your code with
   "CDynaRecordset".

<LI>Replace CDatabase objects with CDynaDatabase. The CDynaDatabase class
   contains an Open() function with a parameter that permits you to
   conditionally load the cursor library. When you use dynasets, you don't
   want to load the cursor library.

<LI>Derive your CRecordView class from CDynaRecordView. The CDynaRecordView
   contains modified versions of OnInitialUpdate() as well as OnMove(),
   which require you to use a CDynaRecordset rather than a CRecordset.

<LI>Replace all RFX function calls in the recordset's DoFieldExchange()
   function with their related Dyna_RFX... functions included in
   DYNARFX.CPP. Place the Dyna_RFX... functions outside the ClassWizard
   tagged section, otherwise ClassWizard will produce a parsing error the
   next time it tries to read your file. The ClassWizard section is
   delimited by "//{{AFX_FIELD_MAP(CYourRecordset)" and
   "//}}AFX_FIELD_MAP".
<P>
</UL><h3>Why Are the ODBC 2.1 Components Necessary?</h3>
 
<P>
The ODBC 2.1 Driver Manager is required to avoid a bug that occurs with the
previous versions of the driver manager. If you use the driver manager
(ODBC.DLL) included in the ODBC Driver Pack, you will receive an "Invalid
Cursor State" error when using dynasets and trying to add a record to a
table following an query that produced an empty recordset. In other words,
if you open a CRecordset object and the query returns an empty recordset, a
subsequent AddNew()/Update() call will cause the error. The ODBC 2.1 driver
fixes this problem. The ODBC 2.1 components shipped with Visual C++ 1.52.
