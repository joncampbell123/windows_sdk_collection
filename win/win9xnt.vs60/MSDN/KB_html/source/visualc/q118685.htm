The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 4.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
The Win32 SDK provides a utility called the Working Set Tuner (WST). This
tool analyzes the amount of system memory resources that an application is
using (known as the application working set) and repacks the code to
minimize the working set. This minimizes memory demands and improves
performance.
<P>
There are several things required when building an application that is to
be analyzed with WST. These requirements can be found in the WST
documentation; however, the WST documentation fails to mention that the
/DEBUG:MAPPED switch must be passed to the linker. This is in addition to
the other linker options mentioned. The oversight was probably made because
the SDK linker uses this switch by default.
<P>
The linker included with Visual C++ for NT does not use the /DEBUG:MAPPED
switch by default. In fact, the /DEBUG:MAPPED switch is not included in the
Visual C++ documentation because it is not required by any of the tools
included with Visual C++. However, this switch is supported by the Visual
C++ linker and must be used if the application is to be tuned using WST.
