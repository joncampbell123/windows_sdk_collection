<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.51, 1.52

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Calling the run-time function cosl() with an argument equal to one-half the
value of pi (3.14159) may generate a general protection (GP) fault when it
is called within a DLL, and you are running on a computer that has no math
coprocessor.
<P>
This error does not occur when cosl is called within an .EXE file; also, it
does not occur when cosl() is called within a DLL or .EXE when you are
running on a computer that has a math coprocessor.
<P>
In addition, sin() is known to produce incorrect results when it is called
within a DLL when you are running a computer that has no math
coprocessor.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
FPATCH.EXE is a self-extracting file that contains the FASTADD.OBJ library
module that fixes these problems.
<P>
NOTE: FASTADD.OBJ does not fix the tan() problem described in Knowledge
Base article <B><A href="../visualc/q111067.htm">Q111067</A></B>.
<P>
The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Software
Library:

   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

</PRE>FASTADD.OBJ is also available in Visual C++ version 1.52 for Windows in the
Msvc15\Lib directory. Visual C++ version 1.52 users must run the
PATCHDLL.BAT file in the Msvc\Lib directory to patch the C run-time
libraries.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
