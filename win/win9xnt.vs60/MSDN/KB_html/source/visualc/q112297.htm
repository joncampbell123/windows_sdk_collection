The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The C Run-time (CRT) included with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 4.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
An attempt to replace a C run-time (CRT) function with a user-defined
version may cause the linker to issue a warning or error message when
linking with the CRT dynamic-link library (DLL) MSVCRTx0.DLL. With Visual
C++ version 4.0 and MSVCRT40.DLL, the following errors are generated:
<P>
<PRE>   MSVCRT.LIB(MSVCRT40.dll) : error LNK2005: &lt;function_name&gt; already
      defined in &lt;file.obj&gt;
   &lt;target_name&gt; : fatal error LNK1169: one or more multiply defined
      symbols found

</PRE>where &lt;function_name&gt; is the name of the function being replaced and
&lt;file.obj&gt; is the name of the object module containing the user-defined
version of that function. At this point, the linker halts, failing
to build &lt;target_name&gt;.
<P>
With Visual C++ version 2.x and MSVCRT20.DLL, the following error is
generated:
<P>
<PRE>   MSVCRT.LIB(MSVCRT20.dll) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol
      "&lt;symbol&gt;"

</PRE>After displaying this error message, the linker will build the target
using the CRT version of the function instead of the user-defined version.
<P>
With Visual C++ version 1.0 and MSVCRT10.DLL, the following
warning is generated:
<P>
<PRE>   msvcrt.lib(msvcrt10.def) : warning LNK4006: &lt;function_name&gt;
      already defined in &lt;file.obj&gt;; second definition ignored

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The /MD compiler switch is used when creating applications that use the DLL
version of the CRT. The /MD switch causes the compiler driver to define the
_MT and _DLL symbols so that both the multithreaded and DLL versions of the
run-time routines are selected from the standard header files. /MD also
causes the compiler to place the library name MSVCRT.LIB in the object
file. MSVCRT.LIB is the import library for the CRT DLL that is named
MSVCRTx0.DLL. (In the name of the DLL, "x" is a digit referring to the
DLL's version. This number is the same as the major version number of the
corresponding Visual C++ with which it was distributed. For Visual C++
version 1.0, the name is MSVCRT10.DLL. For Visual C++ versions 2.x and 4.0,
the names are MSVCRT20.DLL and MSVCRT40.DLL, respectively.)
<P>
Most function prototypes in the standard CRT header files are prefaced with
the _CRTIMP symbol. When code is compiled without the /MD switch and the
_DLL symbol is not defined, _CRTIMP is therefore defined to be nothing.
However, when code is compiled with the /MD switch and _DLL is defined,
_CRTIMP is defined to be __declspec(dllimport). The __declspec(dllimport)
tells the compiler that this routine actually resides in a DLL. For
example, the following is the prototype in IO.H for the _commit CRT
function:
<P>
<PRE>   _CRTIMP int __cdecl _commit(int);

</PRE>When the compiler sees a function declared as __declspec(dllimport), it
generates references to the function via a decorated name. The name
decoration used follows the pattern __imp__&lt;function_name&gt;. For example,
the _commit function is referenced as __imp___commit.
<P>
If a user-defined version of a CRT function is compiled so that it can be
statically linked into applications, the linker errors or warning listed
above will be generated when that function is linked into an application
that was compiled with /MD. The linker generates the error because it has
encountered two definitions of the CRT function. With Visual C++ versions
1.0 and 2.x, the user-defined version of the function is not called because
the linker preferentially looks for the version of the function that is
decorated as an imported DLL entry point. With Visual C++ version 4.0, the
linker terminates, forcing the user to implement one of the resolutions
presented below or to specifiy /FORCE:MULTIPLE on the link command line.
This option tells the linker to create a valid .EXE or .DLL file whether or
not it finds more than one definition for a symbol. But, be warned, doing
so will generate the following link warning:
<P>
<PRE>   MSVCRT.LIB(MSVCRT40.dll) : warning LNK4006: &lt;function_name&gt; already
      defined in &lt;file.obj&gt;; second definition ignored
   &lt;target_name&gt; : warning LNK4088: image being generated due to /FORCE
      option; image may not run


</PRE>There are two ways to allow the user-defined version of the function to be
used. The first method involves providing a prototype for the CRT function
that does not use __declspec(dllimport). The code shown in Sample Code 1
below illustrates this method. MAIN.C simply opens a stream, writes to it,
and then calls _commit to force the data to be written to the file.
COMMIT.C provides code for a user-defined version of the _commit CRT
function. In this case, the function simply displays a message and returns
0 (zero). The code in MAIN.C does not include IO.H, the standard header
file that prototypes the _commit function. Instead, MAIN.C provides its own
prototype for the _commit function, which does not use
__declspec(dllimport). To build Sample Code 1, use the following compile
and link commands:
<P>
<PRE>   cl /c /MD MAIN.C
   cl /c COMMIT.C
   link MAIN.OBJ COMMIT.obj /NOD MSVCRT.LIB KERNEL32.LIB

</PRE>A second method is to place the user-defined function into a DLL. Exporting
the user-defined version of the function from a DLL causes the symbol to be
exported with the name the compiler is referencing based upon the prototype
in the standard header file.
<P>
The code shown in Sample Code 2 below illustrates this method. To build
this sample, use the following compile and link commands:
<P>
<PRE>   cl /c /MD MAIN.C
   cl /MD /LD COMMIT.C
   link MAIN.OBJ COMMIT.LIB
