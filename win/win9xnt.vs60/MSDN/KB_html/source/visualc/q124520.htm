The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The C Run-time (CRT) included with:
   Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The run-time libraries have a preset limit on the number of files you
can have open at one time as described in the More Information section
of this article.
<P>
You can, however, increase these limits by downloading the Increased
File Handle Libraries for Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions
2.0, 2.1 and 2.2. Download Vc20xf.exe for Visual C++ 2.0, or Vc22xf.exe for
Visual C++ 2.1 and 2.2.
<P>
The following files are available for download from the Microsoft Software
Library:

   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services


</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Preset Limits</h3>
 
<P>
Attempting to open more than 64 file handles (or 20 file streams)
concurrently in a process will fail if you are creating a single-
threaded application that uses the static run-time library (LIBC.LIB) by
using the /ML compiler option (the default).
<P>
Attempting to open more than 256 files handles (or 40 file streams)
concurrently in a process will fail if you are using the static
multi-threaded run-time library by using the /MT compiler option and
LIBCMT.LIB. The same limit applies if you use the DLL version of the
run-time library by using the /MD compiler option and MSVCRT.LIB or
MSVCRT20.DLL.
<P>
<P><h3>Increased Limits Using the Files in VC20XF.EXE &amp; VC22XF.EXE</h3>
 
<P>
VC20XF.EXE ans VC22XF.EXE include the following five files:
<P>
<PRE>   README.TXT   - File containing instructions on use of these .LIBs
   LIBC.LIB     - Single threaded run-time library
   LIBCMT.LIB   - Multi-threaded run-time library
   MSVCRT2X.LIB - Import library for MSVCRT2X.DLL
   MSVCRT2X.DLL - Multi-threaded run-time library in a DLL.

</PRE>These run-time libraries have been rebuilt to allow the use of up to 509
file handles and up to 125 file streams in an application. The total is
actually 512 handles and 128 streams, but three handles and streams are
used by the run-time library for the standard C input/output/error
files, stdin, stdout, and stderr. Note that each stream (FILE*) uses a
handle, so the two limits are not independent of each other.
<P>
When building your application, the libraries must be in your current
directory, or in a directory specified by the LIB environment variable.
If you place them in the \MSVC20\LIB directory, make a backup copy of
the existing libraries of the same name.
<P>
For MSVCRT2X.LIB to be used as a default library, you must rename it to
MSVCRT.LIB. If you use this library, MSVCRT2X.DLL must be in the path or
in the Windows system directory. You may distribute MSVCRT2X.DLL with
applications built with MSVCRT2X.LIB.
<P>
These files are provided for the convenience of Visual C++ users; they
are provided as is without any support.
<P>
File handles are obtained when you use the low-level I/O functions
(_open and _sopen, and _creat) to open a file. When one of these
functions fails because the application has reached the file limit, they
will return -1, and set the global variable errno to the constant
EMFILE. EMFILE is defined in ERRNO.H as 24.
<P>
File handles are also associated with the iostream classes. When a
member function or constructor of an iostream class fails because the
application has reached the file limit, the bad member function will
return a nonzero value. Note that many other types of errors can also
cause the bad member function to return a nonzero value.
<P>
File streams are associated with the stream I/O functions (fopen,
_fdopen, and _fsopen). When one of these functions fails because the
application has reached the file limit, they will return NULL. Note that
many other types of file stream errors can also cause the functions to
return NULL.
<P>
NOTE: You must call SetHandleCount() to increase the number of file
handles available on WIN32s. This function changes the number of file
handles available to a process. Under Win32s, this default is 20. It has
no effect when called under Windows NT.
