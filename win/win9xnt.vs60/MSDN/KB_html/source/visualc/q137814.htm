The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) included with:
<P>
   - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.5, 1.51, 1.52
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2,
<P><PRE>     4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 5.0
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The MFC Encyclopedia article "Recordset: Declaring a Class for a
Predefined Query" describes how to invoke a predefined query that takes
parameters and returns a result set. The instructions in that article will
not work for predefined queries that take parameters and do not return a
result set. Some possible error messages you may receive when attempting
to do this are:
<P>
<PRE>   No columns were bound prior to calling SQLExtendedFetch
   State:SL009:, NATIVE:0, Origin: [Microsoft][ODBC Cursor Library]

   Invalid cursor state
   State:24000, Native:24, Origin:[Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access
   Driver]

</PRE>There are two ways that you can use predefined queries that take
parameters and don't return a result set with the MFC ODBC classes:

<OL><P><LI>You can execute the query from the CRecordset::Open() member
   function. If you do this, you will have to override the Open()
   function to not try to move to the first record and also not call
   any recordset member functions that expect a result set to be
   present.

<P><LI>You can execute the query using direct ODBC API calls. In this
   case, you will have to bind the parameters yourself rather than
   letting the RFX functions do this for you.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If your SQL command returns a result set, it is preferable to use a
CRecordset-derived class, and pass the SQL to the recordset Open() member
function. Using CRecordset is preferable when a result set is returned
because the database classes do most of the work of binding the returned
data to variables in your program. The CRecordset class will also do most
of the work of binding parameters as well.
<P>
If you have a predefined query that takes parameters, you have a choice
between using a CRecordset-derived class to take advantage of its support
for binding the parameters or using the CDatabase::m_hdbc member variable
and doing the binding yourself.
<P>
<P><h3>Using a CRecordset-derived Class</h3>
 
<P>
In the first case, you can use the technique that is shown in the
encyclopedia article "Recordset: Declaring a Class for a Predefined
Query."
<P>
You just have to make sure that you don't try to manipulate the result
set, because there isn't one. The mandatory step is to override
CRecordset::Open() to prevent calling the code that moves to the first
record once the recordset is opened. This is accomplished by copying the
code from CRecordset::Open() (in Dbcore.cpp) and commenting out the code
that tries to move to the first record. For example, in MFC 3.2, you would
comment out the MoveFirst() call at the end of the Open() function:
<P>
<PRE>     BOOL CMyRecordset::Open(.....)
     {
        .
        .
        .

        // MoveFirst();  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; comment this line out!
     }

</PRE></OL>In addition, you should not call any function that assumes a result
set is present.
<P>
Then, set up the predefined query as mentioned in the encyclopedia
article. To actually invoke the query, you would do something like this:
<P>
<PRE>     CMyRecordset rs;
     rs.m_Param = someValue    // value for parameter
     rs.Open(CRecordset::snapshot,"{CALL MyQuery (?)}",
     CRecordset::readOnly);
     rs.Close();


</PRE>NOTE: In Visual C++ 4.0 and 4.1, the implementation of CRecordset is
changed and requires four additional steps to be taken to make this first
approach work:

<OL><P><LI>You need to use a database object derived from CDatabase that contains
   an accessor function that returns a reference (or pointer) to its
   m_listRecordsets member. Your CRecordset-derived class needs to use
   this reference to add itself to the m_listRecordsets. Here is how you
   can define the CDatabase-derived class (you can place this declaration
   at the top of your CRecordset-derived class's header file):
<P>
<P><PRE>      class CMyDatabase : public CDatabase
      {
      public:
<PRE></PRE>         CPtrList&amp; GetRecordsetList() { return m_listRecordsets; }
      };

</PRE></OL>In order to use this function to add your recordset to the database's list
of recordsets, you must construct your CRecordset-derived class off of a
MyDatabase (or whatever you called the derived class) and replace the
following lines in the copy of the CRecordset::Open:
<P>
<PRE>      // Add to list of CRecordsets with allocated hstmts
      m_pDatabase-&gt;m_listRecordsets.AddHead(this);

</PRE>with this:
<P>
<PRE>      // Add to list of CRecordsets with allocated hstmts
      CPtrList&amp; listRecordsets =
         ((CMyDatabase*)m_pDatabase)-&gt;GetRecordsetList();
      listRecordsets.AddHead(this);

</PRE>The reason for this step is that MFC 4.0 and 4.1 declare CRecordset to be
a friend of CDatabase that allows it to directly manipulate the protected
m_listRecordsets member. Friendship is not inherited, however, so other
measures must be taken to allow the recordset to add itself to the
database's list of recordsets.

<OL><P><LI>#include &lt;afxpriv.h&gt; at the top of your CRecordset-derived class's .cpp
   file. This is necessary because CRecordset::Open that you copied into
   your recordset class makes use of the USES_CONVERSION and T2A macros.

<P><LI>Remove the following line (which is only needed if you are building
   MFC) from Open:
<P>
<P><PRE>      NO_CPP_EXCEPTION(strDefaultConnect.Empty());
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add the following line at the top of your CRecordset-derived class's
   .cpp file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      static const TCHAR szDriverNotCapable[] = _T("State:S1C00");
</PRE><P>
</OL>This line is present in dbcore.cpp, and szDriverNotCapable is used in
CRecordset::Open. Because it is static, it is not visible outside
dbcore.cpp, so you must provide it in order to use the code for Open.
<P>
<P><h3>Using CDatabase::m_hdbc and Doing Your Own Binding</h3>
 
<P>
Another possibility is to execute the predefined query using the m_hdbc
member of CDatabase. If you choose this method, you will have to do the
parameter binding yourself using ODBC API calls:
<P>
<PRE>      CDatabase*  pDb;
      RETCODE     nRetCode;
      HSTMT       hstmt;
      SDWORD      cBytes;
      SDWORD      nParamValue;

      // Construct and open the database object
      pDb = new CDatabase;
      pDb-&gt;Open("My_Datasource");

      // allocate the hstmt
      AFX_SQL_SYNC(::SQLAllocStmt(pDb-&gt;m_hdbc,&amp;hstmt));
      if (!pDb-&gt;Check(nRetCode))
         AfxThrowDBException(nRetCode,pDb,hstmt);

      // bind the parameter
      AFX_SQL_SYNC(::SQLBindParameter(hstmt,1,SQL_PARAM_INPUT,
         SQL_C_LONG,SQL_INTEGER,10,0,&amp;nParamValue,4,&amp;cBytes));
      if (nRetCode != SQL_SUCCESS)
         AfxThrowDBException(nRetCode,pDb,hstmt);

      // set the parameter value
      nParamValue = 3;

      // execute the query
      AFX_SQL_ASYNC(pDb,::SQLExecDirect(hstmt,
        (UCHAR FAR*)"{CALL MyQuery (?)}",SQL_NTS));
      if (nRetCode != SQL_SUCCESS &amp;&amp; nRetCode != SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO)
         AfxThrowDBException(nRetCode,pDb,hstmt);

      // free the hstmt
      AFX_SQL_SYNC(::SQLFreeStmt(hstmt,SQL_DROP));

      // Close and destruct the database object
      pDb-&gt;Close();
      delete pDb;
