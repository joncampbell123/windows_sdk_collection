The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Visual Workbench included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.5 and 1.51
    - Microsoft Fortran PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0 and 1.0a
</UL></PRE>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
After modifying an open project in Visual C++ by either changing the
files listed in the project or modifying the build switches, it is
possible to get one of the following errors:

<UL><LI>The file &lt;project.mak&gt; cannot be written.
<P>
</UL>This error indicates that the user does not have sufficient access rights
to write to the file and is usually related to networking privileges.
However, this error can be issued erroneously.
<P>
Additionally, the following error may be given incorrectly:

<UL><LI>The directory specification '&lt;drive&gt;&lt;directory&gt;' is invalid.
<P>
</UL>This error should indicate a read error usually centered around the
inability to change directories on a different drive.
<P>
This error may occur after editing a project and selecting the Cancel
button. Or, when selecting a project from the Project menu's most-recently-
used list.
<P>
Manifestations of these errors may vary under different environments.
<P>
When these errors are being issued erroneously, it is usually due to a
conflicting third party driver, either a 32 bit VxD listed in the [386ENH]
section or a 16 bit driver (.DRV) in the [BOOT] section of the SYSTEM.INI
file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can be resolved by using the standard troubleshooting
guidelines for Visual C++ as outlined in the following Microsoft Knowledge
Base articles:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="../visualc/q102333.htm">Q102333</A></B> Troubleshooting Visual C++: Setup and Build Process
   <B><A href="../visualc/q117674.htm">Q117674</A></B> How to Create a SYSTEM.INI Without Third-Party
                Drivers

</PRE>In particular, starting Windows with a SYSTEM.INI file which is free of
third party drivers usually solves this problem.
<P>
This problem appears to be limited to WFW 3.11 and PC's with multiple
drives (logical or hardware). Well known causes of this problem include
drivers from PC AnyWhere and Norton Utilities version 8.00.
<P>
In the case of Norton Utilities and Norton Desktop the SYMEVNT.386 in
the [386Enh] section is the problem. Commenting this out will resolve
the problem.
