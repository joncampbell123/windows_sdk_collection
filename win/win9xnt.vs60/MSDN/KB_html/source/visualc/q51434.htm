<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following code sample allows you to determine how many CRT file
handles are available at run time for a particular process. The
function makes use of the predefined pointers _iob and _lastiob, which
are set to point to the first and the last input/output information
blocks, respectively. The I/O blocks are examined to determine whether
they are in use, and a total number of available file handles is
produced. There is no equivalent C library function currently
available.
<P>
NOTE: This is not necessarily an indication of the maximum number of
physical files that can be opened. The system-wide limit is set in
MS-DOS by FILES= in the CONFIG.SYS file. In OS/2, this limit is
arbitrarily governed by system resources and is modified for each
process by DosSetMaxFH().
