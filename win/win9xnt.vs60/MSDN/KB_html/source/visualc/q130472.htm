The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.5, 1.51, and 1.52
<LI>Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, versions 2.0, 2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Installing Visual C++ on a machine that also has Mosaic (a World Wide Web
navigation client for Windows) installed causes the setup program to issue
this warning:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup cannot open the destination file &lt;fileName&gt;. The file may be in
   use by another application, or marked read only. Close the application
   or change the file's read-only attribute and try again.

</PRE>The user is allowed to dismiss the dialog box with Abort, Retry, or Ignore.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The problem is that Mosaic is compiled using Visual C++ and uses three of
its redistributable DLLs (MSVCRT20.DLL, MFCANS32.DLL, and MFCUIA32.DLL).
Mosaic installs these files with the read-only attribute, which causes the
Visual C++ setup program to issue the warning when it attempts to overwrite
them.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
First, verify that there is not another application using the DLL by
shutting down the other applications. Once you have done this, the easiest
(and safest) solution is to remove the read-only attribute from the files
by using File Manager or some other utility. Then switch back to the setup
program and Retry the operation. This is especially important if you are
installing Visaul C++ version 2.1 because the MSVCRT20.DLL file has been
changed.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
NCSA has confirmed Mosaic installs these DLLs with the read-only attribute.
It appears to be an oversight on their part because the program does not
require the DLLs to have this attribute.
