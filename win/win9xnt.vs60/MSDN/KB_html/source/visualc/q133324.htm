The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) included with:
   - Microsoft OLE Control Developer's Kit (CDK) versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Attempting to create or insert an OLE control may cause the following
assertion message to be generated:
<P>
<PRE>   Assertion Failed: &lt;application&gt;: File ctlmodul.cpp, Line 192

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The assertion is the function _AfxGetCtlModuleStatics and is the following:
<P>
<PRE>   ASSERT(_afxCtlTlsIndex != NULL_TLS);

</PRE>The assertion fails because the process creating the OLE control has used
up all of its available thread-local storage (TLS) slots.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid the problem, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Package more than one OLE control per .OCX file. A TLS slot is
   allocated when a process first attaches to an .OCX file.
   Implementing more than one OLE control per .OCX file will use only
   one TLS slot per .OCX file while still allowing the process to
   use each of the OLE controls associated with the .OCX file.
<P>
</UL>-or-

<UL><LI>Design the containing application in such a way that it does not need
   to be able to create so many OLE controls simultaneously.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The 32-bit MFC implementation of OLE controls uses TLS to store control
module state information. One TLS slot is allocated every time a process
attaches to a new OLE control (.OCX) file. One process may allocate up to
TLS_MINIMUM_AVAILABLE TLS slots. TLS_MINIMUM_AVAILABLE is guaranteed to be
at least 64 slots on all systems.
<P>
NOTE: TLS_MINIMUM_AVAILABLE is a Win32 limitation rather than an MFC
limitation.
<P>
This problem will occur when a process tries to access more than
TLS_MINIMUM_AVAILABLE TLS slots, whether they are used for control module
state information or for some other purpose. TLS_MINIMUM_AVAILABLE is the
maximum number of different .OCX files (packages that contain OLE controls)
that may be loaded before the assertion occurs. Depending on how your
container uses thread local storage, you may encounter the assertion after
loading a fewer number of .OCX files.
<P>
NOTE: This does not restrict the number of OLE Controls that can be placed
in a container simultaneously. As long as your process uses no more than
TLS_MINIMUM_AVAILABLE TLS slots, the number of controls that can be created
is constrained only by available memory.
<P>
TLS allocation and usage was changed with MFC version 4.0 and the limit on
the number of simultaneous OLE controls has effectively been removed.
