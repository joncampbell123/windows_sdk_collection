SUMMARY
 
<P>
The text below presents information from Part 1 of the CONFIG.WRI file
distributed with Microsoft Visual C++ version 1.5. Setup installs
CONFIG.WRI in the MSVC\HELP directory.
<P>
MORE INFORMATION
 
<P>
Part 1: Notes on Files, Tools, and Devices
<P>
<P><h3>Command-Line Utilities and MSVCVARS.BAT</h3>
 
<P>
You must run MSVCVARS.BAT before you can compile and link from the command-
line or run any of the other command-line utilities that ship with Visual
C++. This batch file sets your PATH, INCLUDE, and LIB environment variables
to work with Visual C++. Setup installs MSVCVARS.BAT in the Visual C++ BIN
directory. To avoid having to run MSVCVARS.BAT repeatedly, add its contents
to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
<P>
<P><h3>FILES= Setting in CONFIG.SYS</h3>
 
<P>
The number of files specified in the CONFIG.SYS file should be at least 50.
Check that your CONFIG.SYS file contains the following line:
<P>
<PRE>   FILES=50

</PRE><h3>Using a Permanent Swap File for Increased Performance</h3>
 
<P>
Using a permanent swap file instead of a temporary swap file can
significantly decrease the time required to compile files. A permanent swap
file of at least 4 megabytes is recommended on a system with 4 megabytes of
RAM. See your Microsoft Windows User's Guide for more information on
creating a permanent swap file.
<P>
<P><h3>Using HPPCL5A Printer Driver</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using the HPPCL5A.DRV printer driver under the Debug version of
the Windows kernel, you may encounter large numbers of RIPs. A newer
version of this driver, HPPCL5MS.DRV, solves this problem. This driver is
available for downloading from the Microsoft Download Service. To get this
driver from the Microsoft Download Service, use your modem to dial (206)
936-6735. Once connected, read the WDL.TXT file which has a list of all the
drivers available and where to get them.
<P>
<P><h3>Using an UltraStor SCSI adapter</h3>
 
<P>
The USPI14.SYS device driver supplied with the UltraStor SCSI adapter
should be loaded on systems that use this adapter. Unpredictable behavior
can result if this device driver is not loaded.
<P>
<P><h3>Setting Up Sample Programs That Require PENWIN.DLL</h3>
 
<P>
The following sample programs included in Visual C++ use Microsoft Windows
extensions for Pen Computing:
<P>
<PRE>   EXPENSE        GWAPI
   HFORM          PENPAD
   SNOOP          SREC
   HELPHOOK       PENAPP

</PRE>To use these sample programs, install the PENWIN.DLL file in a directory
listed in the PATH environment variable. This file is not installed on the
PATH during default installation. PENWIN.DLL is included with the
redistributable files in the following products:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Visual C++ 1.0, Professional Edition
   Microsoft C/C++ 7.0
   Microsoft Windows 3.1 SDK

</PRE><h3>HelpFiles Path</h3>
 
<P>
Visual Workbench, App Studio, AppWizard, and ClassWizard all provide
context-sensitive help. They search for their respective help files
according to the paths specified in the Help Files Path specified in the
Directories dialog on the Options menu. Visual Workbench and the Wizards
use the MSVC.HLP file; App Studio uses APSTUDIO.HLP.
<P>
This path specification is maintained as the HelpFile string in the
MSVC.INI file. The HelpFile string may specify multiple paths, each
separated by semi-colons. For example:
<P>
<PRE>    C:\MSVC\HELP;E:\MSVC\HELP

</PRE>Setup sets the HelpFile string to point to two directories: the hard disk
directory you specified for help, and the MSVC\HELP directory on your CD-
ROM.
<P>
If you request context-sensitive help in the Visual Workbench, App Studio,
AppWizard, or ClassWizard, and you receive a message stating the help file
cannot be found, do one of the following:

<OL><P><LI>Try again after inserting the Visual C++ disc in your CD-ROM drive.

<P><LI>Use Setup to install help files on your hard disk.
<P></OL>
