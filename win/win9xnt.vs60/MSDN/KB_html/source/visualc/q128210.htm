The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version 2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists the answers to the most frequently asked questions about
Visual C++ version 2.1 and lists the new features added to version 2.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>How do I get Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version 2.1?
<P>
</OL>Purchase the Microsoft Visual C++ Subscription. If you have Visual C++
version 2.0, you can purchase an upgrade to the subscription by mailing in
the coupon in your version 2.0 box or by calling Microsoft at 800-426-9400.
Otherwise, you can contact your nearest reseller.
<P>
The subscription is available in the U.S., Canada, or Europe only. If you
live outside these areas, you must purchase Visual C++ version 2.0 and
contact your subsidiary for the upgrade.

<OL><P><LI>When is it available?
<P>
</OL>Subscribers started receiving it at the end of February 1995.

<OL><P><LI>What is in it?
<P>
</OL>The first subscription release of Visual C++. It adds new functionality to
the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library to support Windows 95, as
well as Simple MAPI and Windows Sockets. It also adds new features to
the OLE Control Developer's Kit (CDK) including the ability to use MFC
database classes in OLE controls. Finally, the release includes new
samples, documentation, and of course bug fixes. Review the rest of this
article for more details.

<OL><P><LI>I paid $199 for version 2.0, so why do I have to pay $199 again for the
   subscription?
<P>
</OL>If you bought the version 2.0 subscription, you get version 2.0 and three
releases (one year's worth). If you bought the subscription now, you get
version 2.1 and three releases (one year's worth). On an ongoing basis the
subscription will be $299 for a year, so you are receiving a discount
because you bought version 2.0.

<OL><P><LI>I just want bug fixes how do I get those?
<P>
</OL>You need to buy the subscription to get the version 2.1 release. We will be
following a pattern of three releases a year, generally one major release
that will be available for purchase stand-alone and two other releases that
will contain a variety of content and be available to just subscribers. Of
course, if there is a bug that affects a large number of people, we will
make it available free as a patch as we always have.

<OL><P><LI>When is version 3.0 coming out?
<P>
</OL>We do not discuss future releases.

<OL><P><LI>Why isn't there a Macintosh or RISC subscription?
<P>
</OL>Microsoft is investigating this. At this point, Macintosh or RISC products
are lower volume products, and because this release focuses on Windows 95,
it isn't a big issue as far as features.

<OL><P><LI>Does Visual C++ version 2.1 still come with the 16-bit Visual C++?
<P>
</OL>Yes, version 1.52 of 16-bit Visual C++ ships with the subscription update.
We updated MFC with MAPI, WinSocket, and CPropertyPage/Sheet support and
made several bug fixes.

<OL><P><LI>Are you going to continue to bring 32-bit MFC features back to 16-bit
   MFC?
<P>
</OL>In general our focus in on the 32-bit product and Win32 development. We
have no further plans to update the 16-bit product beyond maintenance.

<OL><P><LI>I've subscribed, why I haven't received it?
<P>
</OL>Here are several possible reasons why:

<UL><LI>You did not activate your subscription. You must send in the activation
   card that came in the box. You'll find it next to the MFC hierarchy
   chart. If you lost it, please call 800-719-5577 and have your Product ID
   number ready.

<LI>You live outside the United States or Canada. The Visual C++
   Subscription is now being launched in Western Europe. As for other
   countries, we're working on it. Please understand that it takes time to
   get the subscription available everywhere, so this CD will be available
   as a standalone upgrade through your local subsidiary.

<LI>You bought the non-subscription edition. If you live in the U.S. or
   Canada, you can upgrade to Visual C++ Subscription by sending in the
   upgrade card in the box. If you lost the card, please call Microsoft
   at 1-800-719-5577 to order the Subscription.

<LI>Something else went wrong. Please call Microsoft at 1-800-719-5577 with
   your Product ID number and we'll try to work things out.
<P>
</UL><h2>WHAT'S NEW IN VISUAL C++ VERSION 2.1</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Additions to Editors and Wizards</h3>
 
<P>
The following features are new to the editors and wizards in Visual C++ for
Windows NT Version 2.1:

<UL><LI>Dialog editor support for new Windows Common Controls. You can add spin-
   button, tab, tree view, and other Common Controls to dialog boxes in
   your Windows 95 applications (and in applications for future versions of
   Windows NT). If you want to add Windows Common Controls to your
   application, you must be running under the same operating system on
   which the target application will run. For example, you can develop an
   application under Windows NT version 3.5 that will run on Windows 95,
   but you cannot include Windows Common Controls.

<LI>ClassWizard support for new Windows Common Controls. Map control
   notification messages to MFC handler functions, and add classes derived
   from Windows Common Control classes. ClassWizard's improved layout makes
   these tasks easier.

<LI>AppWizard support for Simple MAPI (the Windows Messaging API) and
   Windows Sockets.

<LI>Complete AppWizard support for OLE Automation in a dynamic-link library
   (DLL).

<LI>AppWizard support for creating a USRDLL project. AppWizard can now
   provide you with a skeleton CWinApp-derived object, rather than a
   DllMain function as it does when creating an MFC Extension DLL.
<P>
</UL><h3>New features in 32-bit MFC</h3>
 
<P>
The following features have been added to MFC in the 32-bit product:

<UL><LI>New Windows Common Control classes. Currently you can use these controls
   only in applications that will run under Windows 95. They will also be
   supported by future versions of Windows NT (starting with Windows NT
   version 3.51) and Win32s.

<LI>Support for Simple MAPI, the Windows Messaging API, in classes CDocument
   and COleDocument.

<LI>Windows Sockets classes for network programming (CAsyncSocket, CSocket,
   and CSocketFile).

<LI>New 32-bit Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers for use with the
   MFC database classes.
<P>
</UL>This release also contains Visual C++ version 1.52, an update to version
1.51, which shipped with Visual C++ version 2.0. Visual C++ version 1.52
runs on Windows version 3.1 or higher and Windows NT version 3.5 and
includes the 16-bit MFC version 2.52. The following features have been
added to Visual C++ for Windows version 1.52:

<UL><LI>Besides OLE and database classes, this version includes classes for OLE
   control development. It also includes a number of new MFC 2.52 classes
   ported from the 32-bit product.

<LI>Like the 32-bit product, new features in MFC 2.52 include: Support for
   Simple MAPI in classes CDocument and COleDocument, Windows Sockets
   classes for network programming, and new 16-bit ODBC drivers for use
   with the MFC database classes.

<LI>In addition, the 16-bit version now includes CPropertySheet and
   CPropertyPage -- MFC classes that support "tab dialog boxes" — known as
   "property sheets" in MFC. Previously, these were only available in
   32-bit Visual C++ 2.0.
<P>
</UL><h3>New to the OLE Control Developer's Kit (CDK)</h3>
 
<P>
The following features have been added to the CDK:

<UL><LI>Support for using the MFC database classes in OLE controls. This allows
   you to create data access controls using the CDatabase and CRecordset
   classes. The database support also includes a sample program, called
   DB, which illustrates the use of the MFC ODBC database classes in an OLE
   control.

<LI>OLE controls that work under Win32s.

<LI>Performance improvements, particularly in the areas of control creation
   and property access.

<LI>Support for "grab handles" when controls are active.
<P>
</UL><h3>Bug fixes and information</h3>
 
<P>
The product contains several new samples, technical articles and bug
fixes for Visual C++ versions 1.5 and 2.0 and for the OLE Control
Developer's Kit.
