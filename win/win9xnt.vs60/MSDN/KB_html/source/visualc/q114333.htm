<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The online documentation which is included with Visual C++ for Windows
does not include a guide to the MFC, ODBC, and OLE 2.0 tutorials. This
article explains how to find the tutorials and what topics they cover.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Five tutorials are included with this product. They are "Scribble",
"Scribble Step 7", "Contain", "AutoClik", and "Enroll".
<P>
1) Scribble introduces the Visual C++ environment and several of the
<PRE>   Microsoft Foundation Classes to the beginning user. It is located in the
   "Class Library User's Guide", chapters 2-10. Since this tutorial is
   meant to introduce several new concepts to the user, it is meant to be
   completed first. If the user has already completed this tutorial from
   Visual C++ 1.0, or has prior knowledge of MFC and programming in the
   Windows environment, then this tutorial is optional.

</PRE>The following tutorials can be completed in any order since they introduce
separate topics which do not depend on the user's knowledge of the other
tutorials' topics.
<P>
2) Scribble Step 7 is an extension of the Scribble Tutorial and
<PRE>   demonstrates how to convert a complete MFC application to an OLE server.
   It is located in the "OLE 2 Classes" manual, Part 1, chapter 5.

</PRE>3) Contain is implemented in two steps and demonstrates how to write a
<PRE>   container application using the Application and Class Wizards and the
   MFC OLE2 classes. It is located in the "OLE 2 Classes" manual, Part 1,
   chapters 2-4.

</PRE>4) AutoClik is implemented in three steps and demonstrates how to write an
<PRE>   automated server application using the Application and Class Wizards and
   the MFC OLE2 classes. It is located in the "OLE 2 Classes" manual, Part
   1, chapters 6-9.

</PRE>5) Enroll is implemented in three steps and demonstrates how to write a
<PRE>   database application using the MFC database classes, the Class and
   Application Wizards, and the Application Studio. It is located in the
   "Database Classes" manual, Part 1, chapters 2-5.
