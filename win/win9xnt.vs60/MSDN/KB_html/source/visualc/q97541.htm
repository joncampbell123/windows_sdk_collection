<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The text below presents information in Part 3 of the README.WRI file
distributed with Microsoft Visual C++ version 1.0. Setup installs
README.WRI in the MSVC\HELP directory.

<P><h3>App Studio Graphics Editor and Display Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
You may find that the App Studio graphics editor behaves improperly
when running on display hardware that supports resolutions greater
than 800 x 600 or more than 16 colors. These problems are usually
caused by the display driver provided by your hardware manufacturer.
<P>
Here is a list of symptoms that have been traced to driver bugs:

<UL><LI>The rightmost column of pixels in odd-width images is set to black.

<LI>A GP fault occurs when editing an icon (see "Improving Display
   Performance" below).

<LI>An INT 3 is executed in the driver file while debugging with Visual
   Workbench.

<LI>Extra pixels are painted while using the brush on a monochrome
   image.

<LI>One-pixel lines drawn diagonally are thicker than they should be.

<LI>Changing a monochrome image to color corrupts the image.

<LI>The fill tool does not fill correctly.
<P>
</UL>If you are having these problems when using the App Studio graphics
editor, and if you are running Windows at high resolution or with more
than 16 colors, you should first see if the problem is being caused by
your display driver. If so, then you should get an updated driver from
the hardware manufacturer or from the Windows Driver Library to
correct the problem.
<P>
To see if the problem is caused by your display driver, install one of
the standard Microsoft display drivers using the following procedure:

<OL><P><LI>Run the Windows setup program (not the Visual C++ setup).

<P><LI>Choose the Change System Settings command from the Options menu.

<P><LI>In the Display drop-down box, choose either VGA or Super VGA (if
   your display hardware supports 800 x 600 resolution), choose OK,
   and follow the instructions to install the new driver.
<P>
</OL>After you restart Windows with the new driver, run App Studio and see
if the problem you were experiencing still occurs. If the problem no
longer occurs, then your display driver was the cause of the problem.
<P>
You can avoid problems by simply continuing to use one of the standard
Windows display drivers. However, to take advantage of the higher
resolution and/or number of colors supported by your display hardware,
you must get an updated display driver that fixes the problems. The
best way to get an updated version of your display driver is to
contact your hardware manufacturer directly. You can also get some
drivers from the Microsoft Windows Driver Library.
<P>
A list of drivers known to cause problems in App Studio are listed
below. Following this are instructions for getting drivers from the
Windows Driver Library.
<P>
<P><h3>Drivers Known To Cause Problems in App Studio</h3>
 
<P>
ATI Ultra and ATI Ultra Pro. The ATI drivers that ship with Gateway
2000 and other machines had several known display driver bugs at the
time that Visual C++ 1.0 shipped. ATI is aware of these problems and
is working to fix them. You can contact ATI directly at (905) 882-2626.
Updated ATI drivers were not available in the Windows Driver Library
at the time Visual C++ shipped.
<P>
<P><h3>Procedure for Obtaining a New Display Driver</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft has made available the Windows Driver Library (WDL). The WDL
offers support for many printers, displays, sound cards, and network card
adapters not provided with Windows 3.1. If you have a modem, the drivers
are available at no charge on Microsoft OnLine and the Microsoft Download
Service (MSDL). However, note that standard connect-time fees and long-
distance telephone charges, if any, still apply during downloading. When
you connect to any of these services, please read the WDL.TXT file for
downloading instructions and a complete list of devices supported in the
WDL. If you don't find your display supported in this file, you may be able
to use the SVGA256 driver, a new high-speed 256-color display driver that
supports most non-accelerated Super VGA displays. The displays that the
SVGA256 driver supports are listed below.
<P>
The phone number for the MSDL is (425) 936-MSDL (6735). There is no
connect-time charge for using this service. The WDL is in the Microsoft
Software Library. To find WDL.TXT, search on S13354.
<P>
If you do not have a modem, you can obtain individual Windows drivers
on disk by calling Microsoft Product Support Services at (425)
635-7007. It will take a minimum of ten working days to receive driver
disks.
<P>
<P><h3>Supported Displays</h3>
 
<P>
Displays supported by the SVGA256 driver include the following:
<P>
<PRE>   ATI VGA Wonder
   Cirrus Logic VGA(6420, 5420 series)
   Oak Technology VGA (077 series)
   Paradise VGA
   Trident VGA (8900 series)
   Tseng ET4000 based, including:
      Boca VGA
      Cardinal VGA
      Diamond Speedstar series
      Everex Viewpoint series
      Metheus Premier VGA
      Orchid Prodesigner II
      Sigma VGA Legend
      STB Powergraph
   Video Seven VGA
      FastWrite
      1024i
      VRAM
      VRAM II
   Western Digital VGA

</PRE></OL><h3>Improving Display Performance</h3>
 
<P>
App Studio has a built-in workaround to avoid severe bugs when running
on some common display hardware at resolutions above 800 x 600 or with
more than 16 colors. This workaround was added because display drivers
for common display hardware did not implement the StretchBlt()
graphics function correctly at the time Visual C++ 1.0 shipped. The
App Studio workaround causes repaint performance in the graphics
editor to be slower than it would be otherwise. It is possible that
you are using a display driver that does not require this workaround,
in which case you can improve repaint performance in the App Studio
graphics editor.
<P>
To improve the performance of the graphics editor place the following
line in the [Graphics Editor] section of your APSTUDIO.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   [Graphics Editor]
   DriverCanStretch=1

</PRE>To test this change, run App Studio and create a new bitmap. If you
can create the bitmap and draw in it successfully, then your display
driver does not have the StretchBlt() problem. Leave the new line in
your .INI file for improved performance in the graphics editor.
<P>
If App Studio behaves improperly when you create a new bitmap, then
your driver has the StretchBlt() problem. You should remove the
DriverCanStretch line from the .INI file and contact your hardware
vendor to see if an updated driver is available.
<P>
<P><h3>Resizing the Drop-down for a Combo Box</h3>
 
<P>
To change the initial size of a combo box drop-down in the App Studio
dialog editor, you normally click the control's drop-down arrow. This
displays the drop-down portion of the combo box and activates the
sizing handle at the bottom of the control. In some cases, especially
when the drop-down portion of the combo box has a height of zero, the
appearance of the resize handles may not change.
<P>
However, you can still resize the combo box vertically. Click the
drop-down arrow and place the mouse cursor on the bottom sizing
handle. The mouse cursor changes to an up-and-down sizing arrow, and
you can resize the combo box vertically in the usual way. For complete
information about resizing combo box drop-downs, see pages 47-48 in
the "App Studio User's Guide."
