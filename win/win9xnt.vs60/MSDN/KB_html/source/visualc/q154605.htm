The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++, Macintosh Cross-Development, version 4.0
   on the following platforms:
   - 68k Macintosh
   - Power Macintosh
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to create "fat" Macintosh applications. Most
commercial Macintosh applications on the market today are available
in "fat" versions. A "fat" application includes both 68K and PowerPC code
so it can run on either platform.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The process of creating a "fat" application consists of building a Power
Macintosh application and a 68K application and then merging the CODE
resources from the 68K build into the Power Macintosh application. The
merging can be done with ResEdit.
<P>
To build a "fat" version of your program that will run optimized on both
68K and Power Macintoshes, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Build the 68K-targeted application with Visual C++ and transfer it to
   the Power Macintosh.

<P><LI>Build the PowerPC-targeted application with Visual C++ and transfer it
   to the Power Macintosh.

<P><LI>Open both versions with ResEdit.

<P><LI>Copy all of the resources from the 68K version to the Power Macintosh
   version. If ResEdit asks you to resolve the conflicting resource IDs,
   it is better to choose to replace the existing IDs.
<P>
</OL>Additionally, the SIZE resource contains information regarding the size of
the application memory partition. The optimal memory partition size often
varies between the Power Macintosh and the 68K Macintoshes. After copying
the resources from the 68K application, edit the SIZE resource in ResEdit
to a memory partition size that works well on both the 68K and Power
Macintosh. "Fat" applications may require significantly more disk space.
<P>
You now have a "fat" application. This assumes that you have the same
menus, windows, dialogs, and other resources for both versions of the
program and that the two targets are both in the same Visual C++ project.
