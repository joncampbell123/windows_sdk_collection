The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0
    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.5, and 1.51
    - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, versions 1.0, 2.0, and 2.1
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
The form of operator new that takes a parameter of type "void *" was
added in the March '93 ANSI C++ draft document, as Section 17.1.1.3.
As such, it is not supported by the Win32 Software Development Kit
(SDK) compiler.
<P>
This feature may be added to a future Microsoft C/C++ compiler;
however, there are certain considerations. If this addition is made
to NEW.H, then every C++ program that includes NEW.H in more than one
module will receive multiple definition errors. Either the definition
must be declared in the CRT or declared INLINE. Furthermore, because
the user should be able to replace the definition of "operator new",
the definition must be replaced in the C Run-Time library (CRT) to ensure
that it is not inlined into some modules, which would prevent it from being
user-replaced.
<P>
NOTE: This change was made Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version 4.0.
