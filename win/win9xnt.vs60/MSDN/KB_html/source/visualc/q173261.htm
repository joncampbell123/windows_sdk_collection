The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) included with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 4.0,
<P><PRE>     4.1, 4.2, 5.0
</UL></PRE>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to start an application that contains a modal dialog function,
such as CDialog::DoModal, AfxMessageBox, or MessageBox, that is called from
the CWinApp derived class' InitInstance function by double-clicking on the
application from the Windows 95 Explorer, selecting the saved document from
the Start Menu or double-clicking on it from File Manager, one of the
following may happen:

<OL><P><LI>It may work fine if built with Visual C 2.x running under Windows NT
   3.5x and later.
<P>
</OL>-or-

<OL><P><LI>The dialog or message box may come up, but the application's main
   window may not come up, and the process is now hung, and can only be
   terminated by PVIEW.
<P>
</OL>-or-

<OL><P><LI>The following error message box may be displayed:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Cannot find the file &lt;path\filename&gt; (or one of its components).
      Make sure the path and filename are correct and that all required
      libraries are available.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    And, symptom number 2 may also occur.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you launch an application in File Manager or Windows Explorer, a
WM_DDE_INITIATE is supposed to be handled by the CWinApp and CFrameWnd
OnDDEIntitiate handlers. A call to CDialog::DoModal, AfxMessageBox, or
MessageBox interferes with the ability for the MFC framework to handle
these messages correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
It has been determined that this behavior is by design and that it is not
recommended to place any of these calls within the CWinApp::InitInstance.
Any password dialogs or dialog based components which need to be displayed
in the InitInstance should be of the modeless type.  This does not apply to
a dialog based application or an SDI application.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create an AppWizard Multiple Document Application, specifying a file
   extension to associate with the application.

<P><LI>Call a modal dialog function such as CDialog::DoModal, AfxMessageBox,
   or MessageBox from the CWinApp derived class' InitInstance function.

<P><LI>Run the application, dismiss the dialog or message box, and save the
   document.

<P><LI>Start the application by:
<P>
   - Double-clicking on the application from the Windows 95 Explorer.
<P>
   -or-
<P>
   - Selecting the saved document from the Start Menu
<P>
   -or-
<P>
   - Double-clicking on the application from File Manager.
