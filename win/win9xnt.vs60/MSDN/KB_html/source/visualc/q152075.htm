The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), included with:
   Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 4.0, 4.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using the ActiveX control container support built into MFC, controls
should only be created and used in the primary thread. The primary thread
is the thread created automatically for you during startup of the MFC
program. Starting other threads and trying to use MFC's built-in control
container support will cause unpredictable and erratic behavior of the
primary thread and any other threads that attempt to display ActiveX
controls. This problem will occur whether you use a UI thread or a worker
thread.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This situation appears to occur because the afxOccManager is stored as a
process local variable.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There is no reliable workaround for this issue at this time. If your
program uses ActiveX controls, make sure they are displayed in the primary
thread only.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ 32-
bit Edition version 4.2.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This situation can be reproduced by creating an Appwizard generated app
that supports ActiveX control containment. Create a dialog in the first
thread that displays an ActiveX control. Add a class to your project
derived from CWinThread that will create a secondary thread. Also, add
another dialog to the project that contains an ActiveX control that will be
created as a modeless dialog by the secondary thread when the secondary
thread starts up. This can be done in the CWinThread's InitInstance method.
Build the app. When the app is run, if you show the dialog that contains
the ActiveX control in the first thread, the second thread will no longer
be able to create ActiveX controls. Conversely, if the second thread shows
its dialog first, the primary thread will not be able to create ActiveX
controls. If you attempt to create ocx controls in more than one thread,
you will also get an access violation in OLE32.dll when the program
terminates.
