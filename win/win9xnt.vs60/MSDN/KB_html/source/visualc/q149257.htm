The information in this article applies to:

- The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) included with:
<PRE>  - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version 4.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The SPLIT32 sample demonstrates the following Microsoft Foundation Class
(MFC) programming concepts:
<P>
<PRE>  1. A ReplaceView() function can be created which replaces a
     view in a CSplitterWnd pane with another. The function
     replaces a view but uses the same CDocument object. This
     function can be helpful if a programmer wants to keep the same
     frame window and document for a splitter pane, and only wants to
     delete a view in a pane and replace it with another.

  2. The CDocument variable m_bAutoDelete can be used to prevent the
     destruction of a CDocument object if all views of the document
     are destroyed.

  3. The CWnd::PreCreateWindow() function can be used to prevent
     the main application from having a thick frame, thus preventing
     the user from resizing the main application window.

  4. By trapping the WM_SETCURSOR, WM_MOUSEMOVE, and WM_LBUTTONDOWN
     messages of a CSplitterWnd, you can fix the splitter bars
     in a splitter window so that they can't be moved by the user.

  5. CSplitterWnd panes can contain regular CWnd objects and are not
     limited to the use of CViews.  This sample places a dialog in
     the first pane.

  6. CWnd::CenterWindow() can be used to position windows at the center
      of the screen.

</PRE>NOTE: Use the -d option when running SPLIT32.EXE to decompress the file and
recreate the proper directory structure.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: The following Microsoft Software Library samples, which also replace
various views, are also available:

<UL><LI>VWRPLC32 (MDI)
<LI>COLLECT  (MDI)
<LI>ENROLL   (SDI)
<LI>VSWAP32  (SDI)
<P>
</UL>To understand what the sample does, first execute the program. You will see
a main application window with a splitter window (CSplitterWnd) in its
client area. A selection dialog will be displayed in the first pane and a
view will be displayed in the second pane.
<P>
Click on the View 1 and View 2 buttons. Notice that the view in the second
pane will switch from one to the other. The view is changing, but after
looking at the source you'll see that the document stays the same.
