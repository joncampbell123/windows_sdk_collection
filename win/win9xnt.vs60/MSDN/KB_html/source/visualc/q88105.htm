<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Many of the classes defined in the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC)
libraries require the programmer to perform two steps to create an object.
The CBitmap, CDC, CDialog, and CWnd classes are examples of this class
type. This article discusses the advantages of this design decision.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This two-step process is known as two-phase construction. In the first
phase, a C++ constructor creates an object in a sound state, a state that
can be destroyed by a destructor function. The second phase, usually
performed by the Create() member function, calls into Windows and allocates
resources. [For CBitmap objects, the LoadBitmap() member function performs
the second phase.]
<P>
This design has two main benefits. First, C++ constructors cannot return a
value to indicate failure. Operator new throws an exception when no memory
is available to construct an object. (An ad hoc mechanism, like an fOK
Boolean variable, is one mechanism to indicate an error in construction.)
<P>
Second, if constructors are "cheap" (that is, the constructor requires
little processor time and does not allocate many resources), an object can
be efficiently embedded into another object without a great increase in the
cost of construction.
<P>
For example, consider the process of embedding a CBitmap object into an
object derived from CWnd. If the CWnd-derived object used one-phase
construction, its construction would depend on successful construction of
the CBitmap object. The programmer would not have any flexibility to deal
with any errors as they arose.
<P>
However, in the two-phase method, the application can initialize the bitmap
any number of different ways while checking for failure. In addition, two-
phase embedded objects reduce problems allocating and de-allocating
objects, tracking object ownership, and deleting Windows objects
appropriately.
