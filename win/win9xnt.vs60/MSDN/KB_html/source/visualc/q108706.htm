You can find the answers to more common questions by choosing "Technical
Support" from the Help menu in the Visual Workbench. The README.WRI file,
located in the \MSVCNT\HELP directory, also addresses many common issues.

<PRE>1. Q. When I build my application, I get the warning, "LNK4016: unresolved
      external symbol `__doserrno'". What is causing this warning?

   A. The most likely cause of this error is using /MT (multithreaded run
      time) or /MD [run time in a DLL (dynamic-link library)] when building
      your application and linking with the supplied versions of the
      Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Libraries. To resolve this problem,
      you must rebuild the MFC libraries to use the same version of the
      run-time library as your application. Please see the README.WRI file
      located in \MSVCNT\HELP for more details.

2. Q. Can I use the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Libraries in a
      multithreaded program?

   A. Yes. However, all use of the Microsoft Foundation Classes must be in
      the same thread. Please see TechNote #37 for more detailed
      information.

3. Q. I copied a sample project from the Visual C++ CD to my hard drive.
      Visual C++ is treating the sample as a read-only project. What's
      wrong?

   A. When files are copied from a CD to a hard drive, the files are given
      the read-only attribute. You can change the attribute by using the
      ATTRIB command in MS-DOS, or by choosing Properties from the File
      menu in the File Manager. Note that if you change the attribute of
      the file, you should also change the attribute of its directory.

4. Q. Where is the MFC200.DLL file located?

   A. MFC 2.0 does not support AFXDLLs (MFC in a DLL and extension DLLs) in
      this version of the Visual C++ development system for Windows NT. For
      more information, see the "Microsoft Foundation Class Library Update"
      at the beginning of the Class Library Reference.

5. Q. Can I use .VBX controls with App Studio and MFC 2.0?

   A. .VBX controls are 16-bit DLLs and are not supported in the 32-bit
      Visual C++ environment.

6. Q. I rebuilt my program with the 32-bit version of Visual C++, but now I
      get heap errors when I run my program. What is wrong?

   A. If you were using the Win32 Software Development Kit (SDK) before,
      it's very possible that you were writing past the memory block and
      not being caught. The Win32 SDK run-time libraries often allocate
      more space than is requested. The Visual C++ run time is more strict
      with heap allocations.

7. Q. In Windows 3.1, I could send my diagnostic output (OutputDebugString
      messages and MFC TRACE output) to the communications (com) port or my
      monochrome monitor. How do I do that in the Visual C++ development
      system for Windows NT?

   A. Under Windows NT, debug output is available only to the debugger of
      the process that issues the message. If you want to see the debug
      output of a program, run it under Visual Workbench integrated
      debugger or use the DEB (Debug Event Browser) sample in
      MSVCNT\SAMPLES\DEB.
