<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses some reasons why programs might produce different
floating-point results when compiled with different compiler options.
<P>
The program below produces different results when complied using
<P>
<PRE>   cl -AM -FPi prog.c

</PRE>than when using the following:
<P>
<PRE>   cl -AM -FPa prog.c

</PRE>Part of the reason for the different results is that /FPa and /FPi generate
math routines that don't work the same. /FPi math emulates the 80x87, to
the point of actually converting 8-byte doubles to 10-byte internal format
and doing the math in internal format. /FPa uses an 8-byte format for
calculations; therefore, it is less accurate. This often accounts for
differences in results.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Also, the second number printed in the /FPi case is smaller than DBL_MIN,
as defined in FLOAT.H. This situation is also correct because DBL_MIN is
the smallest possible NORMALIZED value. (Normalized means that the high-
order bit of the mantissa is a one.)
<P>
"Denormals" (numbers where there are zeros in some of the high-order bits
of the mantissa), however, can represent numbers "x" in the ranges +
DBL_MIN &gt; x &gt; 0 and 0 &gt; x &gt; -DBL_MIN. Although this is an unusual
situation, it is not an error. A denormal is less precise than a normalized
number; however, a denormal is still more precise than 0 (zero) (which is
the next best representation). By allowing use of denormal numbers, we make
our floating-point result slightly more accurate. The alternate math
library (/FPa) represents denormal numbers as 0 (zero).
<P>
Another possible cause of differences in floating-point results is the
inclusion or omission of the /Op option. When /Op is omitted, the
compiler may skip storing intermediate results as 64-bit objects in
memory, leaving them instead in the 80-bit registers of the 80x87 (or
emulator package). This increases the speed and accuracy of the
calculation. However, this can decrease the consistency of the
calculations because other intermediate results may have been stored
in 64-bit objects in memory anyway. Including /Op forces all
intermediate results to be stored in memory, giving more consistent
results. This option is often handy in programs involving complicated
floating-point calculations.
<P>
The program and its output follow:
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Code</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;    // START OF PROG.C
#include &lt;float.h&gt;

void main(void)
</PRE>{
<PRE>    double  a,b,c,prod1,prod2;

    _fpreset();
    a=9.5788979e-283;
    b=8.050847e-1;
    c=9.5588526e-28;

    prod1=a*b;
    printf("\n product1 = %1.15le \n",prod1);
    prod2=c*prod1;
    printf("\n product2 = %1.15le \n",prod2);

</PRE>}  // END OF PROG.C
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Results</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE> // RESULTS OBTAINED USING CL -AM -FPi  PROG.C

 product1 = 7.711824142152130e-283

 product2 = 7.371619025195353e-310 // This value is less than DBL_MIN

 // RESULTS OBTAINED USING CL -AM -FPa PROG.C

 product1 = 7.711824142152130e-283

 product2 = 0.000000000000000e+000
