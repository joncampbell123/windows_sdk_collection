The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) included with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 4.2, 4.2b, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Beginning with MFC 4.2, it is possible to use the MFC ODBC classes within
the multithreaded environment of an ISAPI DLL. Versions of MFC ODBC classes
prior to Visual C++ 4.2 were not thread-safe and should not be used in a
ISAPI DLL.
<P>
The remainder of this article explores the use of MFC-based Database
classes within an ISAPI DLL and includes the following:

<UL><LI>General Rules or Using MFC ODBC in a ISAPI DLL
<LI>How ISAPI and Internet Information Server Work
<LI>Debugging Tips
<LI>Sample Code
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>General Rules for Using MFC ODBC in a ISAPI DLL</h3>
 
<P>
An ISAPI DLL is running as part of an NT Service. Therefore, all the rules
and best practices using MFC ODBC in a NT Service apply. Specifically:

<UL><LI>Use an ODBC driver that is thread-safe.

<LI>Use a global instance of CCriticalSection to provide synchronization
   when using MFC ODBC classes.

<LI>Avoid using MFC ODBC globally or across multiple threads.

<LI>Use a system DSN for your ODBC DataSource.

<LI>It may be necessary to impersonate a valid NT user to connect to a
   remote data source such as SQL Server.

<LI>Do not use MFC DAO or the DAO SDK within your ISAPI DLL.
<P>
</UL>Details for these procedures are provided in the Knowledge Base MFC ODBC
and NT Services listed in the REFERENCES section of this article.
<P>
<P><h3>How ISAPI and Internet Information Server Work</h3>
 
<P>
Internet Information Server (IIS) maintains a thread pool to handle
requests made to an ISAPI DLL. If a request is made of an ISAPI DLL, the
thread will call the DLL's entry point (HttpExtensionProc) and follow it to
whatever the extension does until it returns. If multiple users are hitting
the page, then the DLL entry point gets called by an additional thread
before the prior thread (or threads) have returned.
<P>
If a user hits "refresh" repeatedly, the browser ignores the responses to
any outstanding requests and submits a new request. Because of the
"stateless" nature of HTTP, there is no way for the server to know that the
browser is not still waiting for the request. Therefore, when a user hits
"refresh" repeatedly, he or she is emulating a large group of users hitting
the DLL simultaneously.
<P>
You can use CCriticalSection to provide safety in your code, and hit the
refresh button of a browser repeatedly to verify that your code and its
underlying components are thread-safe. Use of Critical Sections will help
create thread-safe code, but it also will impact performance of the ISAPI
DLL. If a user keeps hitting refresh, more and more threads will be
blocked waiting for the original thread (and then successive threads) to
exit the critical section.
<P>
<P><h3>Debugging Tips</h3>
 
<P>
There is a separate Microsoft Knowledge Base article that lists useful
debugging tips for ISAPI DLLs. However, the following three areas stand
out:
<P>
Tip 1: IIS and Caching of ISAPI DLLs
<P>
Internet Information Server will load an ISAPI DLL the first time the DLL
is called, and will then cache it. It will not unload the ISAPI DLL until
IIS stops. When you are making frequent changes to an ISAPI DLL, it can be
time consuming to start and stop IIS with each rebuild of the DLL. There is
a registry entry, however, that will force IIS to flush the ISAPI DLL from
memory after it is no longer used. Consult the IIS 2.0 on-line
documentation, Chapter 10 "Configuring Registry Entries," for details on
how to use the CacheExtensions registry entry. Note that CacheExtensions
should only be used for debugging and not in a production environment for
performance reasons.
<P>
Tip 2: Validating Thread Safety with a Console Application
<P>
You may also want to validate your code in a multithreaded environment
other than an ISAPI DLL. Sample code is provided below for a console
application that spawns threads and performs database operations within
them. This will help determine if a problem is in your code or in the
underlying ODBC components used by your code. Debugging a console
application can also be easier than debugging a ISAPI DLL. For tips on
using MFC ODBC in a console application, see the REFERENCES section below.
<P>
Tip 3:  Identifying the Reason for Network Errors
<P>
When attempting operations with MFC ODBC, you may get an exception thrown
with information such as this:
<P>
<PRE>   *   [State=01000][Error=1326][Microsoft][ODBC SQLServer
       Driver][dbnmpntw]ConnectionOpen (CreateFile()).

   *   [State=08001][Error=1326][Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver]Unable
       to connect to datasource.

</PRE>A error message with "[Error=1326]" usually relates to a network error.
You won't find these error numbers explained in the ODBC documentation.
For the sample message given above, you can discover what the network
error is with the following command:
<P>
<PRE>    net helpmsg 1326

</PRE><h3>Sample Code</h3>
 
<P>
Sample 1: Using CCriticalSection within an ISAPI DLL
<P>
The following sample code demonstrates how to use a global instance of
CCriticalSection to protect use of MFC ODBC classes with an MFC ISAPI DLL:
<P>
<PRE>    CCriticalSection crit;

    void CMyExtension::Default(CHttpServerContext* pCtxt)
    {
        int nRecCount = 1;

        StartContent(pCtxt);
        WriteTitle(pCtxt);

        CMyRecSet rs;

        // Safely open recordset
        crit.Lock();
        rs.Open();
        crit.Unlock();

        // Safely traverse through recordset
        while( !rs.IsEOF() )
        {
            // BEGIN ... your code goes here ...
            CString tmp;
            tmp.Format( _T("Record #%d&lt;BR&gt;"), nRecCount++ );
            *pCtxt &lt;&lt; tmp;
            // END ... your code goes here ...

            crit.Lock();
            rs.MoveNext();
            crit.Unlock();
        }

        // Safely close recordset
        crit.Lock();
        rs.Close();
        crit.Unlock();

        EndContent(pCtxt);
    }

</PRE>Sample 2: Validating Code in a Console Application
<P>
The console application below emulates the multithreaded environment of an
ISAPI DLL. This provides a simple way to debug your code as well as verify
that the code and its underlying ODBC components are thread-safe.
<P>
Use the following steps to build this test code:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new project workspace.

<P><LI>Select console.

<P><LI>Modify the project's Build Settings to:
<P>
   - use MFC in a shared DLL (from the General tab).
<P>
   - use the "Debug Multithreaded DLL" for the Run Time library (from
<P><PRE>     the C++ tab, Code Generation category). If building a release
     version, use the "Multithreaded DLL."
</PRE>
<P><LI>Insert a file with the following code:
<P>
<PRE>    #include &lt;afxwin.h&gt;             // MFC core and standard components
    #include &lt;afxdb.h&gt;              // MFC Database classes
    #include &lt;afxmt.h&gt;              // MFC Multithreading Support

    #include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

    #define MT_MAX_OPENEX   10      // # of times open DB per/thread
    #define MT_MAX_THREAD   10      // # of threads to spawn
    #define MT_MILLISECONDS 10000   // # of millisec to wait for per/thread

    int ThreadNo = 0;               // instance of thread giving output

    CCriticalSection lock;          // Lock critical sections

    UINT ThreadProc(LPVOID)
    {
        CString     strConnect = _T("DSN=CharlotteTown; "
                                    "SERVER=CharlotteTown; UID=sa; PWD=;");
        CDatabase   *pDb=NULL;

        lock.Lock();
        int m_ThreadNo = ++ThreadNo;
        lock.Unlock();

        pDb = new CDatabase();

        for( int i = 0; i &lt; MT_MAX_OPENEX; i++)
        {
            lock.Lock();
            // Your code goes here. This sample just tests opening/closing
            // a database.
            pDb-&gt;OpenEx(strConnect,
                        CDatabase::noOdbcDialog |
                        CDatabase::useCursorLib);
            pDb-&gt;Close();
            lock.Unlock();

            cout &lt;&lt; "Thread #" &lt;&lt; m_ThreadNo;

        }

        if (pDb != NULL)
            delete pDb;

        cout &lt;&lt; "Thread #" &lt;&lt; m_ThreadNo &lt;&lt; " finished." &lt;&lt; endl;

        return 0;

        // Spawn Threads
        for( int i = 0; i &lt; MT_MAX_THREAD; i++ )
        {
            hThreads[i] = CreateThread( NULL,

                                        0,
                                        &amp;dwThread[ i ] );
        }

        // Wait for threads to finish, then clean up
        WaitForMultipleObjects( (DWORD) MT_MAX_THREAD,
