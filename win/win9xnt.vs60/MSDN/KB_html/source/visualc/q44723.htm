The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE) included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft C for MS-DOS, versions 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0ax
    - Microsoft C for OS/2, versions 6.0 and 6.0a
    - Microsoft C/C++ for MS-DOS, versions 7.0
    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.0 and 1.5

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It can be dangerous to allow the Microsoft C compiler to perform loop
optimization on code that contains global variables that may be modified in
interrupt service routines (ISR) or signal handlers. For example, consider
the following code
<P>
<PRE>   int TimerCount = 1000;

   while( TimerCount );
   printf( "Timer expired." );

</PRE>where an ISR is concurrently executing the following:
<P>
<PRE>   void interrupt far ISR()
   {
       TimerCount--;
   }

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This is acceptable code and performs a simple task--it waits for a
global timer variable to reach 0, indicating that the ISR has been
executed a specified number of times. However, the loop optimization
optionally performed by the compiler results in the while() loop being
completely removed from the executable code. Because the compiler does
not know that the ISR is simultaneously accessing TimerCount, it sees
no reason to keep an expression that obviously evaluates to true and
does nothing but waste time. This is NOT a problem with the compiler.
Section 2.1.2.3 of the 7 December 1988 ANSI C draft standard states
the following:
<P>
<PRE>   An actual implementation need not evaluate part of an expression
   if it can deduce that its value is not used and that no needed
   side effects are produced (including any caused by calling a
   function or accessing a volatile object).

</PRE>Because C 5.1 does not semantically implement the "volatile" keyword,
there is no way to indicate that TimerCount is volatile and that the
expression involving TimerCount should not be removed from the program
by the optimizer. Thus, it is reasonable for the compiler to assume
that this expression is not necessary and may be safely removed. With
C versions 6.0 and later, the volatile keyword has been implemented
and can be used to solve this problem.
<P>
When writing code for ISRs or signal handlers that expect conditions
that the compiler cannot predict, care should be used in the choice of
optimizations; if needed, an assembly code listing should be generated
with the /Fc or /Fs /Fa switches and examined for the optimization's
effect. Disabling optimization with /Od may result in slower
executable programs but will prevent optimizer side effects.
