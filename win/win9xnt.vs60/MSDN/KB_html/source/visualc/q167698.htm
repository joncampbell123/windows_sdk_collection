<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 provides support for context-sensitive help by means of the
messages WM_HELP and WM_CONTEXTMENU. It also provides a new style
WS_EX_CONTEXTHELP that has the effect of adding a question mark button to
the windows caption bar of a dialog. The HELP95 sample shows how these
messages can be used to show context Help for a window.
<P>
The sample includes the file help95.hpj that contains the following line:
<P>
<PRE>   #include &lt;c:\msdev\mfc\include\afxhelp.hm&gt; // for VC++ 4.xx

   -or-

   #include &lt;c:\devstudio\VC\MFC\include\afxhelp.hm&gt; // for VC++ 5.00

</PRE>This assumes that the Visual C++ compiler is installed in C:\MSDEV (for
Visual C++ 4.xx) or C:\DEVSTUDIO\VC (for Visual C++ 5.00) directory. You
may need to modify this line to reflect the correct path.

<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In 16-bit MFC, applications implemented context-sensitive Help by using the
accelerator keys F1 and SHIFT+F1 that generated WM_COMMAND messages with
IDs ID_HELP and ID_CONTEXTHELP, respectively. This, together with the MFC
private messages WM_COMMANDHELP and WM_HELPHITEST, was used to bring up
context Help for an application.
<P>
Windows 95 makes this process easier by providing the WM_HELP message that
gets sent each time the user presses the F1 key, giving the application a
chance to bring up Help information on the control that has the keyboard
focus or on the dialog box itself. This new WM_HELP message is not limited
to dialog boxes alone; it gets sent to any window that has keyboard focus
or to the currently active window.
<P>
Windows 95 also provides the new style WS_EX_CONTEXTHELP that adds a
question mark button to a dialog's caption bar. When a user clicks on this
button, the cursor changes to a question mark with a pointer. If the user
then clicks on a control on the dialog box, a WM_HELP message is sent to
it. The control passes this message on to its parent, which should then
handle this message and call WinHelp() with HELP_WM_HELP. This displays a
pop-up window with the Help text for the control.
<P>
There is also the WM_CONTEXTMENU message that gets sent whenever the user
right-clicks on a window. This message is typically used to display a
pop-up menu using TrackPopupMenu(). It can also be used to display context
Help by calling WinHelp() with the parameter HELP_CONTEXTMENU. This has the
effect of displaying a pop-up menu with a "What's This?" entry. Selecting
this option then displays a pop-up window with Help text for the window.
<P>
HELP95 is an MFC MDI application with form views for MDI child windows. The
application shows how to bring up context Help for form views, dialogs,
common dialogs, and property sheets.
<P>
Context Help for dialogs and form views is pretty straight-forward. It
requires that the user handle the WM_HELP or WM_CONTEXTMENU message and
call WinHelp(). Make sure the Help ID is checked for each of the controls
in the resource editor. In case of WM_HELP message, the lParam points to a
HELPINFO structure that contains information about the menu item, control,
dialog box, or window for which help is requested. For WM_CONTEXTMENU
messages, there is no HELPINFO structure with all the information so the
API calls GetDlgCtrlID() and GetWindowContextHelpId() are needed to give
the required information.
<P>
In case of property sheets, it is slightly more complicated. Adding Help
IDs to controls on a property page using the resource editor causes the
DIALOGEX resource to be used instead of the DIALOG resource. But Windows
does not support the creation of property sheets with the DIALOGEX
resource. To work around this, the Help IDs are added programmatically
after the creation of the property sheet and property pages. Also, because
there is no property sheet template, the WS_EX_CONTEXTHELP style has to be
set programmatically. The handling of the WM_HELP and WM_CONTEXTMENU
messages remains the same.
