<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following statement is not correct because the post-increment
operator (++) has higher precedence than the assignment operator (=):
<P>
<PRE>   pointer1++ = pointer2;

</PRE>The following statement
<P>
<PRE>   pointer1++ = pointer2 ;

</PRE>is equivalent to the following statement:
<P>
<PRE>   (pointer1++) = pointer2 ;

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
As defined by the post-increment operation, the result of evaluating
the expression (pointer1++) is NOT an lvalue; therefore, (pointer1++)
cannot be used as a left operand of the assignment operator.
<P>
However, a statement such as the following is correct:
<P>
<PRE>   *(pointer1++) = *pointer2;

</PRE>The above statement is equivalent to:
<P>
<PRE>   *pointer1++ = *pointer2;

</PRE>This statement is correct because although (pointer1++) is not an
lvalue, it can be used for indirection and *(pointer1++) is an lvalue.
<P>
It is very important to understand the difference between the value of
the expression (pointer1++) and the value of pointer1. Although
(pointer1++) has higher precedence in the above statements, the result
of evaluating (pointer1++) has the old value that pointer1 had before
the evaluation of the expression (pointer1++). Because of the side
effect of the post-increment operator, the evaluation of (pointer1++)
causes the value of pointer1 to be incremented by one only after the
rest of the statement has been evaluated. In other words, as an
address, (pointer1++) points to the same memory location as pointer1
used to. Therefore, *pointer1++ or *(pointer1++) represents the same
object as *pointer1 used to.
<P>
The following example has the effect of assigning "a" to memory offset
location 0x100, then incrementing ptr1 to point to memory offset
0x101:
<P>
<PRE>char * ptr1 = 0x100; /* ptr1 points to memory offset 0x100 */

*ptr1++ = 'a';       /* ptr1 points to memory offset 0x101 */
</PRE>
