</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The SHAPES32 sample illustrates deriving an OLE control from a base
control, thus allowing the derived control to take advantage of the base
control's methods, properties, and events.
<P>
The SHAPES32 sample implements a base control class called CBaseShapeCtrl,
and two derived control classes called CCircleCtrl and CRectangleCtrl.
CCircleCtrl and CRectangleCtrl draw themselves using the properties
provided by the base CBaseShapeCtrl class. CCircleCtrl and CRectangleCtrl
also allow access to the methods and events implemented in the base
CBaseShapeCtrl class.
<P>
<P><h3>Properties, Methods, and Events</h3>
 
<P>
The CBaseShapeCtrl class provides the base functionality of a simple shape
control. It implements the following properties, events, and methods:
<P>
<PRE>Name          Type       Use
</PRE> 
<P>

RectEvent2      Event      A test event. Returns void.

</PRE><h3>Modifying the Base Control Class</h3>
 
<P>
Several changes need be made to the code generated by ControlWizard to
allow a derived control to cleanly inherit the functionality provided by a
base control. The following changes were made to the files generated by
ClassWizard:

<OL><P><LI>The ON_OLEVERB entry for AFX_IDS_VERB_PROPERTIES in the CBaseShapeCtrl
   message map was removed:
<P>
<P><PRE>      BEGIN_MESSAGE_MAP(CBaseShapeCtrl, COleControl)
<PRE></PRE>        //{{AFX_MSG_MAP(CBaseShapeCtrl)
        //}}AFX_MSG_MAP
        //ON_OLEVERB(AFX_IDS_VERB_PROPERTIES, OnProperties)
      END_MESSAGE_MAP()

   If this isn't done, control containers will list the Properties... verb
   twice when the Edit | Control Object menu is selected.

</PRE><P><LI>The CBaseShapeCtrl::CBaseShapeCtrlFactory::UpdateRegistry function was
   changed to simply return TRUE:
<P>
<P><PRE>      BOOL CBaseShapeCtrl::CBaseShapeCtrlFactory::UpdateRegistry(BOOL
<PRE></PRE>        bRegister)
      {
        return TRUE;
      }

   If this isn't done the base control will get registered and containers
   will list it along with the derived controls when the user attempts to
   insert a new control.

</PRE><P><LI>The CBaseShapePropPage::CBaseShapePropPageFactory::UpdateRegistry
   function was changed to simply return TRUE:
<P>
<P><PRE>      BOOL CBaseShapePropPage::CBaseShapePropPageFactory::UpdateRegistry(
<PRE></PRE>         BOOL bRegister)
       {
         return TRUE;
       }

   If this isn't done the base class control's property page will get
   registered and will appear in the registry.

</PRE><P><LI>The call to InitializeIIDs in the base control class' constructor was
   removed:
<P>
<P><PRE>      CBaseShapeCtrl::CBaseShapeCtrl()
      {
<PRE></PRE>        //InitializeIIDs(&amp;IID_DBaseShape, &amp;IID_DBaseShapeEvents);

        // TODO: Initialize your control's instance data here.
      }

   If this isn't done there will be a memory leak upon termination when
   the cached type information for the base class does not get freed.

</PRE><P><LI>The base control's section of the project's .ODL file was commented
   out.
<P>
   If this isn't done, some containers, for example, Visual Basic 4.0,
   will fail to load the control.

<P><LI>The CBaseShapeCtrl::DoPropExchange method was modified to not call the
   COleControl::ExchangeVersion function:
<P>
<P><PRE>      void CBaseShapeCtrl::DoPropExchange(CPropExchange* pPX)
      {
<PRE></PRE>        // ExchangeVersion(pPX, MAKELONG(_wVerMinor, _wVerMajor));
        COleControl::DoPropExchange(pPX);

        ...
      }

   The _Version property is serialized via a call to the ExchangeVersion
   method in the DoPropExchange method of the derived control.

</PRE><P><LI>The DoPropExchange method of the derived OLE controls were changed to
   make a call to CBaseShapeCtrl::DoPropExchange instead of
   COleControl::DoPropExchange:
<P>
<P><PRE>      void CCircleCtrl::DoPropExchange(CPropExchange* pPX)
      {
<PRE></PRE>        ExchangeVersion(pPX, MAKELONG(_wVerMinor, _wVerMajor));
        CBaseShapeCtrl::DoPropExchange(pPX);

        ...
      }

</PRE></OL><h3>Manually Updating the Project's ODL File</h3>
 
<P>
ClassWizard does not provide any support for developing OLE controls which
are derived from another control. As a result, the property, method, and
event dispatch ID's used by a derived control class need to be manually
updated. MFC Technical Note #39 discusses the dispatch ID numbering scheme
used by MFC.
<P>
Basically, MFC divides a 32-bit dispatch ID (DISPID) into two parts. The
LOWORD of the DISPID contains the distance from the top of the dispatch
map (1 relative). The HIWORD contains the distance of the dispatch map
from the most derived class (0 relative).
<P>
The CCircleCtrl and CRectangleControl classes use this technique with
their DISPIDs. For example, the CCircleCtrl derived control inherits the
FillColor,LineColor, and LineWidth properties from CBaseShapeCtrl. The
DISPID's for these properties need to be manually added to the CCircleCtrl
properties section of the project's .ODL file and the HIWORD of the
DISPID's needs to be adjusted:
<P>
<PRE>   //  Primary dispatch interface for CCircleCtrl
   [ uuid(A7EC6760-BFED-11CE-8250-524153480001),
     helpstring("Dispatch interface for sample Circle Control"), hidden ]
   dispinterface _DCircle
   {
     properties:
       // NOTE - ClassWizard will maintain property information here.
       //    Use extreme caution when editing this section.
       //{{AFX_ODL_PROP(CCircleCtrl)
       [id(65537)] OLE_COLOR FillColor;
       [id(65538)] OLE_COLOR LineColor;
       [id(65539)] short LineWidth;
       [id(1)] boolean CircleShape;
       [id(2)] short CircleOffset;
       //}}AFX_ODL_PROP
       ...

</PRE>The FillColor, LineColor, and LineWidth properties implemented in the base
class have DISPID's of 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Once the HIWORD portion
of these DISPID's has been adjusted they become 65537, 65538, and 65539.
<P>
The DISPID's for events are handled differently than for properties and
methods. Event DISPID's do not have their HIWORD portion adjusted.
Instead, they are sequential. For example, CCircleCtrl inherits the
BaseEvent1 and BaseEvent2 events from the base control. The DISPID's for
the base events need to be manually added to the CCircleCtrl events
section of the project's .ODL file. Also, the DISPID's assigned by
ClassWizard for the events provided by CCircleCtrl (CircleEvent1 and
CircleEvent2) need to have their DISPIDs manually updated:
<P>
<PRE>   [ uuid(A7EC6761-BFED-11CE-8250-524153480001),
     helpstring("Event interface for sample Circle Control") ]
   dispinterface _DCircleEvents
   {
     properties:
       //  Event interface has no properties

     methods:
       // NOTE - ClassWizard will maintain event information here.
       //    Use extreme caution when editing this section.
       //{{AFX_ODL_EVENT(CCircleCtrl)
       [id(1)] void BaseEvent1(long lParam);
       [id(2)] void BaseEvent2(BSTR pszString);
       [id(3)] void CircleEvent1(long lParam);
       [id(4)] void CircleEvent2(long lParam);
       //}}AFX_ODL_EVENT
   };

</PRE>Manually updating the DISPIDs can be problematic because ClassWizard may
get confused when it sees the entries for the events in the base class.
It's possible that more than one event may be assigned the same DISPID.
After adding new events to a derived class, inspect the project's .ODL
file and fix any conflicts.
<P>
ClassWizard also maintains DISPID values for properties, methods, and
events, in an enum member of the COleControl derived class. Again, because
ClassWizard does not support deriving an OLE control from another control,
it may generate conflicting values for the different DISPIDs. If this
happens, manually edit the values so that they are correct and match the
values as specified in the .ODL file. Following is the portion of the
CCircleCtrl class that shows the DISPIDs used for both the base class and
derived class properties, events, and methods:
<P>
<PRE>   class CCircleCtrl : public CBaseShapeCtrl
   {
   ...

   // Dispatch and event IDs
   public:
     enum {
     //{{AFX_DISP_ID(CCircleCtrl)
     //dispidFillColor   = 65537L,
     //dispidLineColor   = 65538L,
     //dispidLineWidth   = 65539L,
     //dispidBaseMethod1 = 65540L,
     //dispidBaseMethod2 = 65541L,

     dispidCircleShape   = 1L,
     dispidCircleOffset  = 2L,
     dispidCircleMethod1 = 3L,
     dispidCircleMethod2 = 4L,

     //eventidBaseEvent1 = 1L,
     //eventidBaseEvent2 = 2L,
     eventidCircleEvent1 = 3L,
     eventidCircleEvent2 = 4L,
     //}}AFX_DISP_ID
   };
