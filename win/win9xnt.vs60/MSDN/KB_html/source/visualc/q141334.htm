<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
VSWAP32 demonstrates methods of switching between multiple views on a
single document in a single-document interface (SDI) application. VSWAP32
displays two form views and a normal view that displays the list of data
collected in the two form views.
<P>
NOTE: This is the 32-bit version of this sample. There is also a 16-bit
version available called VSWAP.EXE.
<P>
This sample application demonstrates using DDX/DDV (dialog data
exchange/dialog data validation), with correct document updating and
data validation when switching between views. It also correctly catches
unsaved/unvalidated data when the application is closed.
<P>

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The most important implementations of this are in:
<P>
<PRE>    CVswapApp::InitInstance
    CVswapApp::SwitchView
    CVswapApp::SaveActiveViewsData

</PRE>The standard InitInstance code creates an initial document template,
document, and view during the call to ProcessShellCommand. The code added
to the end of InitInstance creates the view objects for the extra views
used in this application and stores their pointers in a CVswapApp member
array. It then cycles through a loop which creates the windows for the
view objects. Each view window is created with a unique child window ID
and a CCreateContext object that associates each view with the same
CDocument object, which was created by ProcessShellCommand. Finally, the
sample code triggers the OnInitialUpdate for the extra views.
<P>
In this sample, both views persist for the lifetime of the application;
however, the application could create the new view dynamically.
<P>
The SwitchView function created in this sample swaps the current view with
a previously hidden view. It accomplishes this by first switching their
child window IDs. This step is necessary because MFC relies on the
standard view pane having the child window ID of AFX_IDW_PANE_FIRST. The
rest of the code hides the current view and tells MFC to repaint and begin
using the new view.
<P>
The SaveActiveViewsData is used to save the information from the active
view to the document object. It is called by SwitchView whenever a view is
switched. SaveActiveViewsData subsequently calls SetToDoc, which actually
updates the data from the form view to the document by using MFC's DDX/DDV
mechanisms in DoDataExchange.
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Code</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>      The SwitchView function is included here as a reference.

      CView* CVswapApp::SwitchView( UINT nIndex )
      {
          ASSERT( nIndex &gt;=0 &amp;&amp; nIndex &lt; NUMVIEWS );

          CView* pNewView = m_pViews[nIndex];

          CView* pActiveView =
          ((CFrameWnd*) m_pMainWnd)-&gt;GetActiveView();

          if ( !pActiveView )    // No currently active view.
              return NULL;

          if ( pNewView == pActiveView )    // Already there.
              return pActiveView;

          // Update Doc's data if needed
          // Don't change view if data validation fails
          if ( ! SaveActiveViewsData() )
          {
              return pActiveView;
          }

          m_nCurView = nIndex;    // Store the new current view's index.

          // Exchange view window ID's so RecalcLayout() works.
          UINT temp = ::GetWindowLong(pActiveView-&gt;m_hWnd, GWL_ID);
          ::SetWindowLong(pActiveView-&gt;m_hWnd, GWL_ID,
                ::GetWindowLong(pNewView-&gt;m_hWnd, GWL_ID));
          ::SetWindowLong(pNewView-&gt;m_hWnd, GWL_ID, temp);

          // Display and update the new current view - hide the old one.
          pActiveView-&gt;ShowWindow(SW_HIDE);
          pNewView-&gt;ShowWindow(SW_SHOW);
          ((CFrameWnd*) m_pMainWnd)-&gt;SetActiveView(pNewView);
          ((CFrameWnd*) m_pMainWnd)-&gt;RecalcLayout();
          pNewView-&gt;Invalidate();
          return pActiveView;
      }
