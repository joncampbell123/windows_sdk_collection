<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The FCSVAL32 sample application was created to show how an application
can do control-by-control validation in a dialog box.
<P>

Software Library:

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The application itself is just a modal dialog box displayed by the
CWinApp::InitInstance(). After displaying the dialog box, InitInstance()
simply quits the application.
<P>
The important part of the sample takes place in the dialog box class
implementation: There are two edit controls. The first takes input of
an integer between 1 and 20. The second takes a character string as
input with length less than or equal to 5. When you tab or mouse-click
from control to control within the displayed dialog box, the contents
of the control that is losing focus are validated.
<P>
<P><h3>The CFocusDlg Class</h3>
 
<P>
The application's functionality centers around the CFocusDlg class and
its implementation of four message handlers (discussed below). Normal
data exchange (DDX) and validation (DDV) using the routines provided by
MFC take place in OnInitialUpdate(), when the dialog box is first
displayed, and when the user chooses the OK button to accept the input.
This is default behavior provided by ClassWizard when member variables
are connected to dialog box controls and can be examined in the dialog
class DoDataExchange() function.
<P>
<PRE>   Special Case 1
   --------------

   The first special case, for which this sample is written, involves
   validating control contents when switching focus from one control
   to the next. This is done by handling the EN_KILLFOCUS notification
   sent by the edit control that is losing focus. The idea here is to
   check the contents and, if they are not valid, to display the
   message box, inform the user, and then set the focus back to the
   control from which it came.

   Unfortunately, some difficulties arise when trying to set the focus
   (or display the message boxes) within a Killfocus message handler.
   At this point, Windows is in an indeterminate state as it is moving
   focus from one control to the other. This is a bad place to do the
   validation and SetFocus() call.

   The solution here is to post a user-defined message to the dialog
   box (parent) and do the validation and SetFocus() there, thus
   waiting for a safer time to do the work.
   (See "CFocusDlg::OnEditLostFocus()" in the file FOCUSDLG.CPP and
   "WM_EDITLOSTFOCUS user-defined message" in the file FOCUSDLG.H.)

   Another thing you will notice about this function is that it uses
   TRY/CATCH to do the validation. The provided DDX/DDV routines throw
   CUserExceptions when failing to validate or load a control's data.
   You should catch these and do the SetFocus() in the CATCH block.

   Special Case 2
   --------------

   The second special case is when the user clicks the Cancel button
   while there is still invalid data in one of the controls. In this
   situation, the user (normally) does not want to know whether his or
   her input is correct because he or she is quitting the application.
   You might consider prompting the user to save and validate the
   input, but normally Cancel means what it says. Focus is sent to
   the Cancel button before the IDCANCEL notification is sent to the
   dialog box, causing EN_KILLFOCUS to be generated by the control.

   Because we want to do control validation, we maintain a flag called
   "m_bValidate". When the user clicks Cancel, the dialog box is
   notified of the mouse-click by the child button through a
   WM_PARENTNOTIFY message. If we handle this message, we can set the
   m_bValidate flag to FALSE, which prevents the validation from
   taking place in the OnEditLostFocus() function. Notice the
   "if (m_bValidate)" right at the beginning.

   IMPORTANT NOTE:
    To ensure that the dialog receives the WM_PARENTNOTIFY message we
    have to explicitly remove the WS_EX_NOPARENTNOTIFY style from the
    Cancel button. For example:

    BOOL CFocusDlg::OnInitDialog()
    {
       CDialog::OnInitDialog();

       // Remove this style so we get the WM_PARENTNOTIFY when the
       // user clicks on the Cancel button
       GetDlgItem(IDCANCEL)-&gt;ModifyStyleEx(WS_EX_NOPARENTNOTIFY,0);

       // Rest of OnInitDialog
       ...
       ...
    }

   Special Case 3
   --------------

   The third special case is when the user inputs bad data and then
   decides to bring another application to the foreground, possibly to
   do some other work or check some other information before
   completing this dialog box' form. The edit control generates a
   EN_KILLFOCUS when the application loses activation but, again, you
   might not necessarily want to validate. So, handle the
   WM_ACTIVATEAPP message and based on the bActive flag that is passed
   as a parameter, set the "m_bValidate" flag to disable validation.
   Upon reactivation, the same message gets handled and this time the
   bActivate flag is TRUE, causing us to re-enable validation.

   Special Case 4
   --------------

   The fourth special case is when the user ends the Windows session
   either through the Program Manager or the ExitWindows() function. In
   this case, handle the WM_QUERYENDSESSION message. If the dialog box
   controls pass validation (coded like the OnOK() function), then
   return TRUE from this handler to allow Windows to terminate.
   Otherwise, return FALSE so that the user can input the correct data.

</PRE><h3>Note for Combobox</h3>
 
<P>
For a combobox that is not a drop list combobox (i.e. if there is an
edit control associated with the combobox) the code in the sample can
cause infinite recursion.
<P>
The following code (in focusdlg.cpp) is used in the sample to set the
focus to the control if the validation fails.
<P>
<PRE>    CATCH(CUserException, e)
    {
        // Validation failed - user already alerted,
        // setfocus() back to the original control.

        ASSERT(bOK == FALSE);
        GetDlgItem(id)-&gt;SetFocus();// Reset the focus.
    }

</PRE>This should be modified so that the focus is set to the edit control of
the combobox if the validation fails.
<P>
<PRE>    CATCH(CUserException, e)
    {
        // Validation failed - user already alerted,
        // setfocus() back to the original control.

        ASSERT(bOK == FALSE);
        GetDlgItem(id)-&gt;GetWindow( GW_CHILD )-&gt;SetFocus();
        // Reset the focus to the edit control in
        // the combobox
    }
