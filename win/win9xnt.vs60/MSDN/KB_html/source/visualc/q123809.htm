The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>   The development environment included with:
     - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version 2.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Visual C++ development environment may fail to unload a DLL from
memory if an abnormal program termination occurs.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Visual C++ development environment loads the DLLs into memory when
the application starts in the debugger. An abnormal program termination
may cause the debugger to fail to remove the DLLs from memory.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
When this happens, you need to exit the development environment and
possibly even log off Windows NT to force the DLL to be removed from
memory.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To reproduce this problem, it is necessary to create a Win32-based
application that calls a Win32-based DLL. That DLL should call another DLL.
You can use the SELECT example from the Win32 SDK samples, and add another
DLL with a single function. Call it from one of the SELECT.DLL functions.
<P>
Once this is set up, remove the secondary DLL from your hard drive. Then
attempt to debug the program in the Visual C++ development environment. An
error message will appear saying it could not find the secondary DLL, and
the executable will terminate.
<P>
Now, attempt to delete the primary DLL being called. Windows will generate
an error message saying that the primary DLL is still in use, even though
the application calling the DLL was terminated.
