<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Visual C++ allows you to increase the number of file handles that may be
open at one time in a program by reassembling the startup source. This
requires Microsoft MASM version 6.1. Because many people do not have access
to an assembler, Microsoft has made libraries available that will allow
users to open more than the standard number of files.
<P>
The files listed below are available for download from the Microsoft
Software Library (MSL). For information on how to download these files,
please see the "Instructions for Downloading" section.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Each of the .EXE files is a self-extracting archive, containing the
following files:
<P>
<PRE>   README.TXT   - File containing instructions on use of these .LIBs
   S40FILE.LIB  - Small model, assembled for 40 handles and streams
   M40FILE.LIB  - Medium model, assembled for 40 handles and streams
   C40FILE.LIB  - Compact model, assembled for 40 handles and streams
   L40FILE.LIB  - Large model, assembled for 40 handles and streams
   S60FILE.LIB  - Small model, assembled for 60 handles and streams
   M60FILE.LIB  - Medium model, assembled for 60 handles and streams
   C60FILE.LIB  - Compact model, assembled for 60 handles and streams
   L60FILE.LIB  - Large model, assembled for 60 handles and streams
   S100FILE.LIB - Small model, assembled for 100 handles and streams
   M100FILE.LIB - Medium model, assembled for 100 handles and streams
   C100FILE.LIB - Compact model, assembled for 100 handles and streams
   L100FILE.LIB - Large model, assembled for 100 handles and streams

</PRE>These are not the complete libraries; they are CRT0DAT.OBJ and _FILE.OBJ,
which are the two files that must be rebuilt to increase both the number of
file handles and streams. The provided README.TXT file contains important
information on how to use these libraries.
<P>
There is one of these directory structures for small, medium, compact, and
large memory models. The use of these .OBJ files is discussed in the README
file that comes with the compressed file.
<P>
NOTE: Although Microsoft provides the run-time source so changes like this
can be made, Microsoft does not support these changes. These files are
provided for convenience of Visual C++ users, and are provided without any
support.
