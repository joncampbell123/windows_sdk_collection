The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) included with:
<LI>Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 4.0,
   4.1, 4.2, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When the MFC and CRT (C Run-Time) libraries do not match in debug/release
or in static/dynamic, you get errors such as the following when linking:
<P>
<PRE>   nafxcwd.lib(appcore.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol
   ___argc

</PRE>Many other strange problems may erupt during build or runtime; memory
corruption, memory leaks, complaints from the debug C Run-Time libraries
during run-time, and more.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When building an MFC application or DLL, you need to insure that all
relevant libraries are in sync:

<UL><LI>If you have selected to build an app using MFC in the Shared Library,
   then you must also use the dynamic version of the C Run-Time
   (MSVCRT.DLL).

<LI>If you have selected to build a debug MFC application, then you must
   also use the debug version of the C Run-Time. Similarly, release MFC
   apps must use the non-debug version of the C Run-Time.

<LI>If your debug MFC application uses extension DLLs, every extension DLL
   must be a debug build as well. Again, release apps must match release
   extension DLLs. The type of C Run-Time library is fixed. Extension DLLs
   and the applications which use them must all use MFC in the shared
   library, which requires the dynamic DLL version of the C Run-Time.

<LI>If you are linking to any static libraries that also link to MFC or the
   CRT, you should ensure that every static library shares the same
   properties (debug/release, CRT-static/dynamic) as the application.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To change the type of C Run-Time library used by an application or DLL, go
to the Build/Project settings property sheet and switch to the C/C++ tab.
On the C/C++ page, choose the "Code Generation" category. Change the value
of the "Use run-time library" listbox. Pay careful attention to make this
specific for each configuration; only one configuration, such as "Win32
(80x86) Debug," should be selected when you change this value.
<P>
<PRE>   Debug, shared library MFC applications - "Debug Multithreaded Dll."

   Release, shared library MFC applications - "Multithread Dll."

   Debug, static library MFC applications - "Debug Multithreaded."

   Release, static library MFC applications - "Multithreaded."

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
