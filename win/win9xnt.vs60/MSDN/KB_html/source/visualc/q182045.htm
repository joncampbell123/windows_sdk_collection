The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The development environment included with:
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 5.0
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you start a build in Microsoft Developer Studio, there could be an
excessive delay before the actual build begins. This typically happens when
building a large project. The delay can be about 3-5 minutes and an
hourglass is shown in the Developer Studio. Then the build proceeds
normally. This happens even when the project is up-to-date.
<P>
This delay occurs only when you try to build the first time after opening
the workspace. Subsequent builds do not experience the delay.
<P>
This delay happens only in Developer Studio running under Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This delay is caused by the dependency checking preceding the build. Before
the build can start, Developer Studio needs to check file dependencies to
decide which files are to be built. For a large project with complex
dependencies, Developer Studio can spend a long time checking file
timestamp information on a Windows 95 machine.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The following are two related workarounds. You should try Workaround 1
first; if that does not work, then consider the second workaround combined
with the first workaround:
<P>
Workaround 1. Use compiler switches /Yc and /Yu to create and use a
precompiled header.
<P>
Workaround 2. Use a precompiled header aggressively by including most of
your project's header files in the precompiled header.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This delay can also be experienced when you try to export the makefile or
start a debug session the first time after opening the workspace.
