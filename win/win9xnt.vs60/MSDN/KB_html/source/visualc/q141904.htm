The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) included with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.1b, 4.2,
<P><PRE>     4.2b, 5.0
</UL></PRE>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are two ways to use SQL aggregate functions to retrieve information
with the MFC DAO classes. One method uses the GetFieldValue() member
function of the CDaoRecordset class to retrieve the values. The other
involves modifying a CDaoRecordset-derived class by changing the SQL
statement used to open the recordset and placing column alias names in the
DFX calls of the recordset's DoFieldExchange() member function.
<P>
NOTE: You can't use the technique described in the MFC Encylopedia article
"Recordset: Obtaining SUMs and Other Aggregate Results (ODBC)" to work with
SQL aggregate functions under DAO. That article pertains to the MFC ODBC
classes only.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>SQL Aggregate Functions Using CDaoRecordset::GetFieldValue()</h3>
 
<P>
The Visual C++ documentation discusses how to use the
CDaoRecordset::GetFieldValue() member function. This function allows you to
use a CDaoRecordset object without deriving from it. One technique for
retrieving records returned from a SQL statement that contains an aggregate
function is to use this GetFieldValue() member function to retrieve the
values.
<P>
For example, assume that you have a student database that contains the
name of the student and scores from tests they have taken. If you want the
average score for each of the students, you could use this code:
<P>
<PRE>   CDaoDatabase db;
   db.Open(_T("d:\\scores.mdb"));

   CDaoRecordset rs(&amp;db);
   rs.Open(dbOpenDynaset,
      _T("SELECT [Student Name], AVG([Test Score]) AS AvgScore "
         "FROM Scores GROUP BY [Student Name]"));

   while (!rs.IsEOF())
   {
      COleVariant varName;
      COleVariant varAvg;
      varName = rs.GetFieldValue(_T("student name"));
      varAvg = rs.GetFieldValue(_T("AvgScore"));

      // You know that the return values are BSTR and VT_R8 types.
      // if you didn't know, you would have to do some checking
      // here. Look at the vt member of the COleVariant to see what
      // type the data is.

      // Do something with the data. This sample prints the
      // information to the output window of the debugger.
      TRACE(_T("%s\n%f\n"), V_BSTRT(&amp;varName), V_R8(&amp;varAvg));
      rs.MoveNext();
   }
   rs.Close();
   db.Close();

</PRE>Notice that the alias name "AvgScore" is used for the column that will
contain the average score for each student.
<P>
<P><h3>SQL Aggregate Functions Using a CDaoRecordset-Derived Class</h3>
 
<P>
To create a CDaoRecordset-derived class that retrieves the results of a SQL
statement with an SQL aggregate function, you need to:

<UL><LI>Explicitly specify the full SQL statement as the second argument of the
   Open() call or return the full SQL statement from the GetDefaultSQL()
   member function. In the SQL statement, specify a column alias for the
   functions that will contain the results of SQL aggregate functions such
   as AVG() or SUM(). For example:
<P>
   rs.Open(dbOpenDynaset,
<P><PRE>       _T("SELECT [Student Name], AVG([Test Score]) AS AvgScore "
<PRE></PRE>          "FROM Scores GROUP BY [Student Name]"));

</PRE><LI>Modify the DFX functions in the DoFieldExchange() member function of
   the CDaoRecordset-derived class so that it uses the alias names. For
   example:
<P>
<PRE>   void CMyRecordset::DoFieldExchange(CDaoFieldExchange* pFX)
   {
      ...
      DFX_Text(pFX, _T("[student name]"), m_student_name);
      DFX_Double(pFX, _T("[AvgScore]"), m_avg_score);
      ...
   }

</PRE></UL>Using this second technique makes the code a little cleaner. For example,
after the CDaoRecordset-derived class has been modified as described above,
here is what the code might look like:
<P>
<PRE>   CAvgSet rs;
   rs.Open(dbOpenDynaset,
      _T("SELECT [Student Name], AVG([Test Score]) AS AvgScore "
         "FROM Scores GROUP BY [Sudent Name]"));
   while (!rs.IsEOF())
   {
      TRACE(_T("%s\n%f\n"), (LPCTSTR)rs.m_student_name, rs.m_test_score);
      rs.MoveNext();
   }
   rs.Close();

</PRE>Notice that there isn't a need to work with COleVariants unlike the
GetFieldValue() technique described previously.
