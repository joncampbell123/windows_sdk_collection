The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.5, 1.51, 1.52

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Visual C++ installs Books Online for use from the CD-ROM drive only. If you
are accessing the CD-ROM drive over a network, or you want to run Books
Online from your local hard disk, you may need to change the drive
designation for the location of the Books Online files. This information is
maintained in the Contents.ini file, which is located in the root directory
of your Windows or Windows NT installation.
<P>
NOTE: running Books Online directly from your hard drive requires
approximately 60-80 megabytes of additional hard disk space. Despite this
increased disk consumption, you may want to run Books Online from your hard
disk for the following reasons:

<UL><LI>To improve access time - depending on your hardware configuration,
   running Books Online directly from your hard disk will be faster than
   running it from the CD-ROM disc.

<LI>To free up the CD-ROM drive. You may want to keep a CD-ROM disc other
   than the Visual C++ CD-ROM disc in the CD-ROM drive.
<P>
</UL>To run Books Online from your local hard disk:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the following files from the \Msvc\Help subdirectory of the CD-ROM
   disc to a directory of your choice on your local hard drive:
<P>
   VCBKS15.HDX
   VCBKS15.IND
   VCSDK15.HLP

<P><LI>Edit the Path= statement in the [VCBKS15] section of the Contents.ini
   file so that it points to the directory you chose in step 1. Be sure to
   include a trailing backslash as in this example:
<P>
   [VCBKS15]
   Path=C:\MSVC\HELP\

<P><LI>Save the Contents.ini file, and then restart Books Online.

<P><LI>Copy the Contents.hlp file from the \Msvc\Help subdirectory of the
   CD-ROM disc to the directory you chose in step 1. If this help file is
   missing, the Help button on the Contents window displays a blank Windows
   Help window, and a dialog box appears saying it can't find the Help
   file. You won't be able to access the Books Online Help chapter in
   Contents.hlp.
<P>
</OL>To access Books Online from a CD-ROM drive over a network, edit the Path=
statement in Contents.ini to point to the location of the following three
files on the network drive:
<P>
<PRE>   VCBKS15.HDX
   VCBKS15.IND
   VCSDK15.HLP
