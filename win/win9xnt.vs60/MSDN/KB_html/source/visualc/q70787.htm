The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The C Run-time (CRT), included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft C for MS-DOS, versions 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0ax
    - Microsoft C for OS/2, versions 6.0 and 6.0a
    - Microsoft C/C++ for MS-DOS, version 7.0
    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, version 1.0
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
In Microsoft C versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0ax, C/C++ version 7.0, and
Visual C++ version 1.0 it is sometimes necessary to explicitly
initialize or reinitialize the C run-time graphics library from an
application program. The following are two situations where this
procedure is necessary:

<UL><LI>A user of the your application shells out and changes to another
   monitor (on a dual-monitor system). When the user returns to the
   application, you need to reinitialize the library to take into
   account the characteristics of the new monitor.

<LI>In the CDLLOBJS.LIB run-time model (that is, C run time in a DLL),
   GRTEXTP.OBJ doesn't get initialized and doesn't work properly. This
   is a known limitation, but it would be nice if you could make it
   work by explicitly initializing it at the beginning of your
   program.
<P>
</UL>In both of these cases, a call to the undocumented function _QCGINIT()
resolves the problem because this initializes the graphics library.
<P>
_QCGINIT() is prototyped as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   void _far _cdecl _QCGINIT(void);

</PRE>Note: _QCGINIT() is an undocumented function that may or may not be
included in subsequent releases of the graphics library. Please keep
this in mind when writing code to take advantage of this function.
Microsoft makes no claims and offers no promises regarding this
function in the areas of performance, reliability, future
availability, or customer support.
<P>
_QCGINIT() is __QCGINIT() in Visual C++ version 1.0 (2 underscores).
