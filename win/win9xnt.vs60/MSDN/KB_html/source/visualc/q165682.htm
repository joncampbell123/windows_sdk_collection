<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Inactive Links in the Online Documentation</h3>
 
<P>
Certain types of links in the online documentation do not work. They look
like links, but if you click them, nothing happens.
<P>
Such inactive links may be due to a setting in your Internet Explorer 3.0
that prevents ActiveX scripts from running.
<P>
To enable the links, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Open Internet Explorer 3.0.
</OL>2. From the View menu, select Options.
3. In the Options dialog box, click the Security tab.
4. Under Active content, check the Run ActiveX scripts check box.
5. Click Apply.
6. Click OK.
<P>
<P><h3>Avoid Disc Swapping During Full-Text Search of the Documentation</h3>
 
<P>
The MSDN CD contains all of the online documentation for all products in
Visual Studio 97. If you install MSDN and leave it in the CD drive, you
will not have to swap discs to search online content.
<P>
If you chose the CD-ROM installation option when you installed Visual C++,
you will need to have the Visual C++ CD in your CD ROM drive most of the
time. To avoid looking for on-line content that is not on the Visual C++
CD, use the Define Subsets command from the Help menu to create a
restricted search subset of the following Visual C++ documentation:

<UL><LI>Welcome to Visual C++ (vcedit)
<LI>Visual C++ Tutorials (vctutor)
<LI>Visual C++ Programmer's Guide (vccore)
<LI>Microsoft Foundation Class Reference (vcmfc)
<LI>C/C++ Language and C++ Libraries (vclang)
<LI>Visual C++ Samples (vcsample)
<P>
</UL>Use this subset when doing most full-text searches. Use the "Entire
Contents" subset when you need to search all of the online documentation
and don't care about disc swapping.
<P>
<P><h3>ODBC 3.0 Programmer's Reference and SDK Guide</h3>
 
<P>
The ODBC 3.0 documentation was not available for integration into Visual
C++ 5.0 Infoviewer at the time of manufacture. (The ODBC documentation that
you can find in the InfoViewer is for ODBC 2.5)
<P>
However, the following Windows Help files (WinHlp32.exe) are installed
during setup in the DevStudio\SharedIDE\Help directory:

<UL><LI>ODBC.HLP -- ODBC 3.0 Programmer's Reference
<LI>SDKGUIDE.HLP -- ODBC 3.0 SDK Guide
<LI>ODBCJET.HLP -- ODBC Microsoft Desktop Database Drivers Help
<LI>ODBCJTNW.HLP -- ODBC Desktop Database Drivers - What's New Help
<P>
</UL>Use the following procedure to add them to the Tools menu:

<OL><P><LI>From the Tools menu, click Customize.
</OL>2. Click the Tools tab.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the Menu contents grid, add a string to
<PRE>   represent launching one of the Help files. For example, type "ODBC 3.0
   Programmer's Reference".
</PRE></OL>4. In the Command edit box, type "WinHlp32.exe".
5. In the Arguments edit box, type the location of ODBC.hlp. For example,
<PRE>   type "C:\Program Files\DevStudio\SharedIDE\Help\ODBC.hlp".
</PRE>6. Click Close.
7. Repeat for each Help file you wish to use.
<P>
<P><h3>Error in the Scribble MDI Drawing Application Documentation</h3>
 
<P>
In the topic "Create the Dialog Box," in the procedure, "To create the Pen
Widths dialog box," Step 3 suggests that you double-click the dialog box to
bring up the dialog box property page. To bring up the property page, right-
click the dialog box, and then click Properties.
<P>
<P><h3>The Properties Menu Item is Now Located on the View Menu</h3>
 
<P>
In the topics "Associating the Toolbar Button with a Command ID" and
"Adding a Tool Tip" in the Scribble MDI Drawing Application, you are
instructed to click Properties from the Edit menu. The Properties item is
now located on the View menu.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Oracle ODBC Driver is Missing From the "ODBC Driver List" Topic</h3>
 
<P>
The list of ODBC drivers, found in the "ODBC Driver List" topic, should
include the Microsoft Oracle ODBC driver.
<P>
<P><h3>HCW.EXE 4.01 Does Not Support Office 97</h3>
 
<P>
The version of Microsoft Help Workshop (HCW.exe) that is installed by
Visual C++ 5 does not support .rtf files created using Office '97. If you
are an Office '97 user creating .rtf files for use with the Microsoft Help
Workshop, you can do one of the following:
<P>
- Use Word '97 and save the file in Word 6.0 format. (Make sure
<PRE>  "Word6.0/95" is in the Save As Type field in the Word '97 Save As
  dialog box.)
</PRE>- Install version 4.02 of the Microsoft Help Workshop, located in the
<PRE>  \DevStudio\VC\Unsupported Tools\HCW directory. This directory is on the
  disc that includes "Microsoft Visual C++" on the label. (Disc 1 if you
  purchased Visual C++; Disc 3 if you purchased Visual Studio.)

</PRE><h3>Typographical Error in Circle Tutorial</h3>
 
<P>
In the topic "Creating the Basic Control," the first class name in the
table that describes the class templates created by ControlWizards is
incorrect. The correct class name is CCircApp.
<P>
<PRE>   Class      Files        Comments
   CCircApp   CIRC.H       Implements the main DLL source.
              CIRC.CPP     Typically, there is no need to modify this code.

</PRE><h3>Documentation Errors in ATL Tutorial</h3>
 
<P>
The ATL Tutorial contains the following two errors:

<UL><LI>Step 4 includes instructions for removing the DllMain entry point.
   Because the ATL COM AppWizard no longer sets DllMain as the entry
   point, this step is unnecessary.

<LI>In Step 6, the statement:
<P>
<PRE>   #include Polygon.h

   should be replaced by

   #include "Polygon.h"

</PRE></UL><h3>Missing Help Topic for "Ignore Export Library" Check Box</h3>
 
<P>
On the Link tab, General category, when a DLL project (/DLL is one of the
link options) is selected in the file tree, there is a new check box,
Ignore export library. The context-sensitive Help for this check box is not
available. The Help text for the Ignore export library check box is as
follows:
<P>
When the Ignore export library box is checked, the parent project will not
automatically attempt to link to the export library of the subproject.
Select this setting when building a resource-only DLL as a subproject of an
EXE.
<P>
<P><h3>Changes to ATL Stock Property Macros</h3>
 
<P>
The macro IMPLEMENT_SMARTPTR_STOCKPROP has been removed from ATL. The macro
IMPLEMENT_BOOL_STOCKPROP has been added and should be used for all stock
properties that are boolean values, such as the standard AUTOSIZE,
BORDERVISIBLE, ENABLED, TABSTOP, and VALID stock properties.
<P>
<P><h3>Changes to the MFC Reference Documentation</h3>
 
<P>
Three changes to the MFC Reference documentation are included below.

<OL><P><LI>Details aboutCOleDateTime
   If you create a COleDateTime object with a date less than 100, the
   date will be accepted, but subsequent calls to GetYear, GetMonth,
   GetDay, GetHour, GetMinute, and GetSecond will fail and return -1.
   Previously, you could use two-digit dates, but dates must be 100 or
   greater in VC++ 4.2.To avoid problems, specify a four-digit date.
   For example:
<P><PRE>      COleDateTime.mytime(1996,1,1,0,0,0);
</PRE>
<P><LI>A new override of GetHttpConnection was added:
   CHttpConnection* GetHttpConnection(LPCTSTR pstrServer, DWORD dwFlags,
   INTERNET_PORT nPort = INTERNET_INVALID_PORT_NUMBER, LPCTSTR
   pstrUserName = NULL, LPCTSTR pstrPassword = NULL);

<P><LI>The following replacement topic for CInternetSession::OpenURL:
<P>
   CInternetSession::OpenURL
<P>
   CStdioFile* OpenURL( LPCTSTR pstrURL, DWORD dwContext = 1,
<P>
   DWORD dwFlags = 0, LPCTSTR pstrHeaders = NULL, DWORD
<P>
   dwHeadersLength = 0 );
<P>
   Throw ( CInternetException );
<P>
</OL>Return Value
<P>
Returns a file handle for FTP, GOPHER, HTTP, and FILE-type Internet
services only. Returns NULL if parsing was unsuccessful. The pointer that
OpenURL returns depends on pszURL's type of service. The table below
illustrates the possible pointers OpenURL can return.
<P>
URL type Returns
<P>
file://CStdioFile*
<P>
<B>http://CHttpFile*</B>
<P>
gopher://CGopherFile*
<P>
<B>ftp://CInternetFile*</B>
<P>
Parameters
<P>
<PRE>pstrURL   A pointer to the name of the URL to begin reading. Only URLs
</PRE></OL>beginning with file:, ftp:, gopher:, or http: are supported. ASSERTS if
pszURL is NULL.
<P>
<PRE>dwContext   An application-defined value passed with the returned handle in
</PRE>callback.
<P>
<PRE>dwFlags   The flags describing how to handle this connection. The valid
</PRE>flags, which can be combined with the bitwise OR operator (|), are:

<UL><LI>INTERNET_FLAG_TRANSFER_ASCII   The file is transferred as a text file.
<LI>INTERNET_FLAG_TRANSFER_BINARY   The file is transferred as a binary
   file.
<LI>INTERNET_FLAG_RELOAD   Get the data from the wire even if it is locally
   cached.
<LI>INTERNET_FLAG_DONT_CACHE   Do not cache the data, either locally or in
   any gateways.
<LI>INTERNET_FLAG_SECURE   This flag is applicable to HTTP requests only.
   It requests secure transactions on the wire with Secure Sockets Layer
   or PCT.
<LI>INTERNET_OPEN_FLAG_USE_EXISTING_CONNECT   If possible, reuse the
   existing connections to the server for new requests generated by
   OpenURL instead of creating a new session for each connection request.
<LI>INTERNET_FLAG_PASSIVE   Used for an FTP site. Uses passive
   FTP semantics. Used with CInternetConnection of OpenURL.
<P>
</UL>pstrHeaders A pointer to a string containing the headers to be sent to the
HTTP server.
<P>
dwHeadersLength The length, in characters, of the additional headers. If
this is -1L and pstrHeaders is non-NULL, then pstrHeaders is assumed to be
zero terminated and the length is calculated.
<P>
Remarks
<P>
Call this member function to send the specified request to the HTTP server
and allow the client to specify additional RFC822, MIME, or HTTP headers to
send along with the request. OpenURL, which wraps the Win32 function
InternetOpenURL, allows only downloading, retrieving, and reading the data
from an Internet server. OpenURL allows no file manipulation on a remote
location, so it requires no CInternetConnection object. To use connection-
specific (that is, protocol-specific) functions, such as writing to a file,
you must open a session, then open a particular kind of connection, then
use that connection to open a file in the desired mode. See
CInternetConnection for more information about connection-specific
functions.
