The information in this article applies to:
<P>
<PRE>   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 2.0 and 2.1
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A project's Object Description Language (ODL) file is not updated when new
automation properties and methods are added using ClassWizard. The
project's ClassWizard (.clw) file has been deleted and rebuilt prior to the
occurrence of this behavior. All properties and methods added before the
rebuilding of the ClassWizard file are still correctly listed in the ODL
file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the .clw file is rebuilt by the development environment, the ODLFile=
keyword line is not added to the new file.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The ODLFile= entry must be manually added to the .clw file so that
ClassWizard can add properties and methods to the ODL file. The ODLFile=
entry can be added by using the development environment editor or Notepad.
<P>
Manually adding the ODLFile= entry will not automatically update the ODL
file to bring it back in synch with ClassWizard. Any properties and methods
that were added via ClassWizard while the ODLFile= entry was missing from
the .clw file must be either manually added to the ODL file or removed and
then added again by using the ClassWizard.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++
version 2.2 for Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
An example of the ODLFile= line can be found in the .clw file provided with
the AutoClik sample. In this sample, the [General Info] section of the
Autoclik.clw file includes the following line:
<P>
<PRE>   ODLFile=autoclik.odl

</PRE>ClassWizard uses this reference to a specific ODL to determine the file to
update when new properties and methods are added. When the .clw file is
rebuilt using the ClassWizard option from the development environment
Resource Editor, the ODLFile= reference line is not included in the newly
built .clw file. After the rebuild, ClassWizard does not issue a warning
when adding new properties and methods to the new .clw file even though the
changes are not reflected in the ODL file.
