<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The MFC browser library (MFC.BSC) that ships with Visual C++ is incomplete.
The browser cannot find some symbols in MFC (for example, References to
CDC::m_hDC).
<P>
There are two self-extracting files included in this article. They both
contain Mfc.bsc files.
<P>
Mfcbsc1.exe contains Mfc.bsc file created with Devstudio installed under
the root directory of a drive. If you have installed Devstudio under the
root directory of a drive, then download this file.
<P>
Mfcbsc2.exe contains Mfc.bsc file created with Devstudio installed under
Program Files directory. If you chose the default directory while
installing Devstudio, then download this file.
<P>
If you have installed Devstudio in a path that does not match any of the
above two, then download any one of the files and put it in the
&lt;Drive&gt;:\&lt;Devstudio directory path&gt;\vc\mfc\src directory. When you open the
browse file and search for a symbol, the browser will not be able to find
the sources. However, it will prompt you for the path and from then on it
should be able to find the sources. This happens every time you open the
browse file.
<P>
Copy the .exe to the &lt;drive&gt;:&lt;Devstudio directory path&gt;\vc\mfc\src and
execute it. It should extract mfc.bsc file in that directory.
<P>
The following files are available for download from the Microsoft
Software Library:

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Alternatively, you can rebuild the MFC browser library (MFC.BSC) on your
machine. First you must have the MFC source files installed.
<P>
Follow this procedure:

<OL><P><LI>Verify that you have around 400 megabytes of free disk space on the
   drive where Visual C++ is installed. This much space is required to
   build the browse information. 358 megabytes is used by the .SBR files.
   The .SBR files can be freed once the browser database has been built.
   Temp files require the additional space. Temp files are automatically
   deleted.

<P><LI>From a Command Prompt, run the Vcvars32.Bat which should be in the
   &lt;drive&gt;:&lt;DevStudio directory path&gt;\vc\bin to set the proper environment
   variables. Change to the &lt;drive&gt;:&lt;Devstudio directory path&gt;\Vc\Mfc\Src
   directory, and build the browse information by running the nmake on the
   makefile as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      nmake browseonly=1 no_pch=1 no_pdb=1 dll=2
</PRE><P>
   This creates NafxeWD.bsc file and a subdirectory called $DLLD.W with
   .SBR files.

<P><LI>Provided you do not plan to rebuild the browse database frequently,
   remove all files in the $DLLD.W directory, and then remove the directory
   itself. The intermediate .SBR files occupy roughly 358 megabytes of disk
   space and are not required to use the browser.

<P><LI>You can rename the new browse file to Mfc.bsc from NafxeWD.bsc.
<P>
</OL>To use the browser file, start Visual C++, and click Open on the File menu.
Choose the .BSC file that you just created. Click Tools, and then click
Source Browser. The Browser window appears and you can look up any of the
MFC functions or data variables.
