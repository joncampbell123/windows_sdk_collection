<P>
The following sample, Asyndown.exe demonstrates asynchronous download of
data in an MFC ActiveX control. MFC wraps this asynchronous download
process in the CAsyncMonikerFile class.
<P>
The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Software
Library:

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
An Asynchronous moniker provides a way to download data asynchronously over
a network. After a download is first requested, Asynchronous Monikers use a
callback interface to indicate that data is available. This data can then
be read with an Asynchronous Read operation.
<P>
A Read operation on an Asynchronous moniker returns immediately even if the
operation has not been completed. If there are only 10 bytes available and
Read is called with 1K, it does not block but returns with the 10 available
bytes at that point in time. It is the caller's responsibility to return
later and attempt to read more data when notified through the callback.
<P>
MFC wraps this asynchronous download process in the CAsyncMonikerFile
class. ActiveX controls can use the CDataPathProperty class, derived from
CAsyncMonikerFile, to help implement asynchronous control properties. This
sample demonstrates how to set up an asynchronous loop using timers to read
the data.
<P>
In the function CDataPathProperty::OnDataAvailable, a timer is set to
indicate that data is available. When the timer message is received, the
sample reads in blocks of 128 bytes and fills an edit control. If data is
not available when the timer message is handled, the timer is turned off.
OnDataAvailable turns on the timer if more data arrives later.
<P>
Please note that the timer duration is intentionally large and data blocks
are intentionally small to demonstrate the behavior even with small files.
<P>
You can test the control either by using the HTML page with the sample or
by inserting the control in a control container and setting the DataPath
property. The control is not signed so you need to set your security
settings appropriately if you want to test the control. Depending on your
security setting, you may still be warned that the control is not safe for
scripting.
