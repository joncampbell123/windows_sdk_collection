The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version 2.0, 4.0, 4.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following error message may be generated when disconnecting from a
network drive after running SETUP.EXE:
<P>
<PRE>    The device is being accessed by an active process.

    More help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 2404.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
SETUP.EXE is a 16-bit Windows-based application that spawns VCSETUP.EXE, a
32-bit Windows-based application. It was included so that error checking
could be done if it was running under 16-bit Windows, or under a different
processor under Windows NT.
<P>
To run a 16-bit application under Windows NT, the Windows-on-Windows (WOW)
layer is used. Once WOW, a 32-bit Windows NT-based application, is started,
it maintains a current directory. If the current directory is the network
drive, you can get the previous error message after setup has finished
executing.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You can disconnect from the network by either running another 16-bit
application that changes WOW's current directory, or by closing down WOW,
using PVIEW.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following information can be found by typing NET HELPMSG 2404:

<UL><LI>The device is being accessed by an active process.
<P>
<P>
   EXPLANATION

<LI>The drive letter you specified is the current drive of a session. You
   tried to delete a drive redirection (x:) while it is in use, possibly
   as your current drive.
<P>
   ACTION
<P>
   Be sure the drive you are trying to delete is not the current drive in
   any of your sessions.
