<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to identify the symptoms of file corruption
problems. At some point after installing one of the products listed above,
you may run into strange build errors that occur on simple projects or even
with some of the sample projects shipped with the products. The problem is
often not resolved until the product is completely removed from your system
and reinstalled. In other words, simply running the setup program again
without removing the product and its associated registry entries does not
resolve the problem.
<P>
The likely cause of these errors is that the build tool reporting the
error, or other files in your installation, have become corrupted.
Following are a few examples of scenarios that can occur:

<UL><LI>C1001 error from the compiler even on simple .CPP files that does
   not occur when compiling .C files. This is happening because the Visual
   C++ parser component (C1XX*.EXE) of the compiler is corrupted.

<LI>L1101 error in LAFXCWD.LIB even when building a 16-bit MFC application
   generated by AppWizard. This is happening because this MFC library
   file is corrupted.

<LI>LNK1141 error when building a DLL. This could be happening because the
   linker (LINK.EXE) is corrupted.

<LI>Internal link error during pass 1. This could be happening because the
   linker (LINK.EXE) or one of the libraries in your installation is
   corrupted.
<P>
</UL>These and other errors could also occur with the 32-bit versions of Visual
C++ if multiple versions exist on the same system.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To verify that the error is really occurring because of a corrupted file in
your installation, you can use the MS-DOS or Windows NT File Compare
program (Fc.exe) to compare the original files on the product CD-ROM and
the copies of the files that have been installed on your system. Use the
following Command line:
<P>
<PRE>   FC /b [drive1:][path1]filename1 [drive2:][path2]filename2

</PRE>The /B (binary) option tells the File Compare program to do a binary
comparison on the files.
<P>
If you decide to do a complete reinstallation of the product, here are the
general steps you should follow:

<OL><P><LI>Uninstall the product.

<P><LI>Delete the directory where Visual C++ resides:
<P>
   - \MSVC\ for Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.51, 1.52,
<P><PRE>     1.52b, and 1.52c.
</PRE><P>
   - \MSVC\ for Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 1.0.
<P>
   - \MSVC20\ for Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2.
<P>
   - \MSDEV\ for Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2.

<P><LI>Delete the registry keys (only in the 32-bit Editions):
<P>
   - For versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2: Search for "Visual C++."
<P>
   - For versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2: Search for "Developer."

<P><LI>Shut down and restart Windows.

<P><LI>Reinstall Visual C++.
