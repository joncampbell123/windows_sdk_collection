   32-bit Edition, version 2.0, 2.1, and 4.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When the same source file (or a copy with the same name in a different
directory) is included in both a DLL and its calling application, the
debugger can become confused about which module in memory to set
breakpoints in. For example, a breakpoint set in the source file belonging
to the DLL may be hit in the DLL or in the application's copy of the source
file, and the module in which the breakpoint is hit may change from one
debugging session to another.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The best solution is to not use source files that have the same name in the
DLL and in its calling application. If you can't avoid it, try using the
context operator to resolve the breakpoint conflict. To do this, specify
both the source file and the EXE or DLL name in the breakpoint location
field of the Breakpoints dialog box using this syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   {,source.cpp,target.exe} .line_number

   -or-

   {,source.cpp,target.dll} .line_number

</PRE>Here line_number is the actual decimal line number in the source code. You
may need to use full path names when specifying the source and the EXE or
DLL names.
<P>
NOTE: This workaround may not always be successful. If it doesn't work, you
must either rename one of the source file copies or live with the errant
breakpoint behavior.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For additional information on the purpose and use of the context operator,
refer to the "Using Breakpoints" section in the "Using the Debugger"
chapter of the Visual C++ Books Online "Visual C++ User's Guide."
Specifically, in Visual C++ 2.0, refer to the "General Syntax for
Breakpoint Locations" entry in the "Using Breakpoints" section; in
Visual C++ 4.0, refer to the "Advanced Breakpoint Syntax" entry of the
"Using the Breakpoints Dialog Box" in the "Using Breakpoints" section.
