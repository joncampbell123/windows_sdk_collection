<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Lstddx32 sample illustrates a technique for filling both an ordinary
list box control and the list box portion of a combo box control with
data, and using the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Dialog Data Exchange
(DDX) facility to return the selection.

<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A common misconception with regard to DDX is that assigning a value to a
DDX variable will cause that data to be loaded into a control. This does
in fact happen for edit controls, but not for list box controls. In order
to add items to a list box the dialog class must use the
CListBox::AddString() or CComboBox::AddString() functions. Doing this
involves several steps which are illustrated by this sample.
<P>
The sample itself was initially created as an MDI application using
AppWizard from Visual C++ version 1.0. AppStudio was then used to create a
dialog which contains OK and Cancel button plus an edit control
(IDC_EDIT1), a combo control (IDC_COMBO1), and a list box control
(IDC_LIST1). The Class Wizard was used to create a class CDialog1 based on
CDialog. The files dialog1.h and dialog1.cpp contain the code for this
class. Class Wizard was also used to add DDX member variables m_edit1,
m_combo1, and m_list1 to dialog1.h. A menu item was added to the view menu
(IDR_LIST_DTYPE) using AppStudio, and a message handler added which will
call the dialog when the menu item was selected.
<P>
The Readme.txt file included with the sample explains in more detail how
the list boxes are initialized and how data is passed between the calling
routine and the dialog procedure.
