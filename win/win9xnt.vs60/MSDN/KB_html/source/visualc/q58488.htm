<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
ANSI mandates that the \0x... character constant doesn't end until the
first nonhexadecimal character, regardless of how many characters that
may involve.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft C version 5.1 ends the constant at the third character or
just before the first nonhexadecimal character, regardless of whether
characters after the third were valid hexadecimal characters.
<P>
Therefore, while "abc\x34564gh" is represented in version 5.1 as shown
below
<P>
<PRE>   Character       a   b   c   E   6   4   g   h
   Hex            61  62  63  45  36  34  67  68
   Decimal        97  98  99  69  54  52 103 104

</PRE>note that the character after "c" is "\x345". Because this has to fit
in 1 byte, and the rules of C say that the low bits are preserved when
converting to a shorter type, "\x345" is equivalent to "\x45".
<P>
In Microsoft C version 6.0, the string is represented as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Character       a   b   c   d   g   h
   Hex            61  62  63  64  67  68
   Decimal        97  98  99 100 103 104

</PRE>Note that "\x34564" -- the character after the "c" -- is equivalent to
"\x64" for the same reason "\x345" was equivalent to "\x45" under the
old rules above. The hexadecimal constant includes all the characters
up to but not including the nonhexadecimal character "g" because of
the rule change described above. C 5.1 compiles such code without
warnings. C 6.0 issues the following warning if the character is too
large to fit in 1 byte:
<P>
<PRE>   C4139: '0x4564' : hex escape sequence is out of range

</PRE>C/C++ version 7.0 and Visual C/C++ version 1.0 and above will issue an
error similar to the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   C2022: '214372': too big for character

</PRE>The '214372' value is the decimal representation of the hexadecimal
value 0x34564.
<P>
The best workaround for this change is to end the string immediately
after the hex character, and restart it. For example, the string
"abc\x34""564gh" is interpreted by all versions of the compiler as
containing the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Character       a   b   c   4   5   6   4   g   h
   Hex            61  62  63  34  35  36  34  67  68
   Decimal        97  98  99  52  53  54  52 103 104

</PRE>Such a string works properly when compiled using any ANSI-compatible
compiler.
