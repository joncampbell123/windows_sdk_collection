In Microsoft products mentioned above, the way /Gt is used determines
which data items are moved out of the default data segment. /Gt alone
is the same as /Gt256, which means that ONLY data items of size 256 and
<PRE> greater get moved out. If you have a lot of data items smaller than
</PRE>that, that data will NOT get moved out. With /Gt256, the data left in
DGROUP plus the stack may still exceed 64K.
<P>
As the value on the /Gt switch becomes smaller, more and more data
gets pushed out. /Gt0 pushes all the data generated by your program
out. However, it also generates some constants in the logical segment
_CONST in DGROUP -- 2 bytes for each extern or uninitialized variable
moved. The following classes of variables generate a 2-byte segment
address in DGROUP for EACH variable of that class declared when /Gt0
is used:

<OL><P><LI>All extern declarations, such as "extern int i;"

<P><LI>All declarations without storage class that are not initialized,
   such as "int i;"
<P>
</OL>Initialized variables, such as "int i = 0;", provided that the sum of
their sizes is less than 64K, are treated as a group and generate only
one segment address in DGROUP per module. Therefore, the optimal
number for minimizing DGROUP space is /Gt3. /Gt3 is better than /Gt0
for uninitialized and extern variables because /Gt0 will move out 1-
and 2-byte data elements to the far heap, replacing them with 2-byte
segment addresses. Not only does this NOT save you space in DGROUP
V.S. /Gt3, but it increases the overall size of the executable V.S.
/Gt3, as you also have to pay 2 bytes in the far heap per data element
moved. Another reason to use /Gt3 over /Gt0 is that although the size
of DGROUP will remain the same, /Gt0 will cause character and integer
data elements to be addressed with far pointers, slowing execution.
With /Gt0, all that remains in DGROUP is the stack, several kilobytes
of variables associated with the run-time library, the near heap (from
which will be allocated some file buffers and the local copy of the
environment), and the 2-byte segment addresses for data items moved
out as needed.
