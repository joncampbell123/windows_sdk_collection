<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists fixes made to Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows in
version 1.52. This information can also be found in the What's New help
file that is available from Books Online or from the initial Setup dialog
box.

<P><h3>Bugs Fixed in Visual C++ 1.52</h3>
 
<P>
Visual C++ version 1.52 fixes a number of bugs from Visual C++ version 1.5.
These include bugs for hosting on Windows 95 and for double-byte character
set (DBCS) code. In addition to such bugs, the following bug fixes are of
particular interest to many developers:
<P>
<P><h3>Fixed Linker Bugs</h3>
 
<P>
CVPACK can cause L5000 problems in these three cases:

<UL><LI>When linking a large number of object modules and libraries with the /CO
   option for CodeView information. For more information, please see the
   following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../utilities/q102920.htm">Q102920</A></B>
<PRE>   TITLE     : FIX: Linker May Cause L5000 with CodeView Information

</PRE><LI>When a class has many data members, each with a long name. This could
   cause CVPACK to fault when trying to compact the type associated with
   the class.

<LI>When there are some faulty buffer limits. This could cause CVPACK to run
   out of types while emitting derived class type records after the pack.
   This could result in a general protection (GP) fault. For more
   information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
   Base:
<P>
   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../utilities/q102920.htm">Q102920</A></B>
<PRE>   TITLE     : FIX: Linker May Cause L5000 with CodeView Information

</PRE></UL><h3>Fixed Debugger Bugs</h3>
 
<P>
In C++ source files, passing an array as an argument to a function and then
trying to watch that array in the function caused the Visual Workbench
debugger to expand the array incorrectly. For more information, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../visualc/q112984.htm">Q112984</A></B>
<PRE>TITLE     : FIX: Debugger Expands Arrays Passed to Functions Incorrectly

</PRE>When you tried to expand a reference to an object in the watch or locals
window of Visual Workbench, the Visual Workbench debugger did not correctly
take the address of reference types when expanding this parameter type. For
more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
<P>
ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../visualc/q116463.htm">Q116463</A></B>
<PRE>TITLE     : FIX: Expansion of Object References Displays a Blank Line

</PRE><h3>Fixed Run-Time Library Bugs</h3>
 
<P>
Using the sin or cosl function in a DLL on a machine with no floating point
unit (FPU) causes problems such as these:

<UL><LI>Calling sin(PI/2) produced the wrong result.
<LI> Calling cosl(PI/2) caused a general protection (GP) fault.
<P>
</UL><h3>Fixed MFC Bugs</h3>
 
<P>
When you used a CLongBinary field variable, only the data located in the
first 64K was read from the binary field. A bug in the RFX_LongBinary
function prevented the CLongBinary object from receiving all of the field's
data when a field had more than 64K of information. For more information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../visualc/q140535.htm">Q140535</A></B>
<PRE>TITLE     : FIX: Only the First 64K Is Read from Binary Field

</PRE>Any call to COleServerDoc::XDataObject::SetData always returned the
HRESULT corresponding to the error SCODE E_OUTOFMEMORY. These calls now
return the code S_OK. For more information, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../visualc/q121522.htm">Q121522</A></B>
<PRE>TITLE     : FIX: SetData Always Returns E_OUTOFMEMORY

</PRE>After opening a file from a floppy drive (or any removable medium)
and removing the disk, Print Preview with Generic Text Only printer
selected failed. The common dialog code in class CPrintDialog loaded the
printer driver to get information. It looked for the printer driver in
the current directory -- in this case on the removed disk. MFC failed to
check the return value of a call to GetDefaults which returned an error in
this case.
<P>
A default OLE container application with OLE Automation enabled initialized
the m_pSelection data member in the wrong function. AppWizard initialized
the member to NULL in the view's nInitialUpdate member function rather than
in the view constructor. This led to an assertion failure in
COleClientItem::OnDraw when you attempted to create a container document
with another application. For example, this problem occurred when using the
Visual Basic CreateObject function. The member is now correctly initialized
in both places. This bug applies to both 16- and 32-bit versions.
<P>
COleDataSource::OnRenderData returned NOERROR instead of TRUE. Because the
function return type was prototyped as BOOL, NOERROR was interpreted as
FALSE. This bug applies to both 16- and 32-bit versions.
<P>
The EXCEPINFO structure was not correctly initialized for an OLE control.
Information already available about an exception -- in particular,
the control name and the name of the control's help file -- was
overwritten. This has been corrected so that the EXCEPINFO structure
is only filled if it is empty. This bug applies to both 16- and 32-
bit versions.
<P>
The wrong window wss determined to be the active window when the HIERSVR
sample application was embedded in Microsoft Excel. When you used Edit
Insert in Excel to insert a HIERSVR object, select the object, then choose
any command that opens a dialog box, the dialog box has the wrong parent.
The parent is in Excel, not HIERSVR. The m_pActiveWnd data member needed to
be set back to NULL once an object left the UI-active state. This was true
for both 16- and 32-bit Excel. This bug applies to both 16- and 32-bit
versions of Visual C++.
<P>
Class CSharedFile allocated global memory using an incorrect option. By
default, CSharedFile allocated GMEM_FIXED memory instead of GMEM_MOVEABLE
memory. This caused GlobalRealloc to fail and throw a memory exception even
though there was still enough memory. The default has been changed to avoid
this problem.
