<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the LoadLibrary() function in 16-bit Windows or in OS/2,
the operating system loads the specified dynamic-link library (DLL)
only once. Therefore, the DLL has the same address in every process.
However, dynamic loading of DLLs works differently in Windows NT.
<P>
The operating system loads a DLL separately for each process because
each application has its own address space in Windows NT; the address
space is shared in 16-bit Windows and in OS/2. Because the operating
system must map pages into the address space for each process, the DLL
may be loaded at different addresses in different processes. The
memory manager optimizes loading DLLs such that if two processes share
the same pages from the same DLL image, they share the same physical
memory.
<P>
Each DLL has a preferred base address, specified at link time. If the
address space range from the preferred base address to the base
address plus the image size is not available, then the operating
system loads the DLL somewhere else in memory and applies fixups to
its addresses. There is no method to specify the load address at load
time.
<P>
To summarize, the system performs the following steps at load time:

<OL><P><LI>Examines the image and determines its preferred base address and
   required size.

<P><LI>Finds the address space required and maps the image, copy-on-write,
   from the file.

<P><LI>Applies internal fixups if the image is not at its preferred base
   address.

<P><LI>Fixes up all dynamic link imports by placing the correct address
   for each imported function into the appropriate entry of the Import
   Address Table. This table stores 32-bit addresses contiguously; to
   store up to 1024 imported functions requires it to dirty only one
   page of memory.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The pages that contain code are shared, using a copy-on-write
protection scheme. Copy-on-write means that a page is read-only;
however, if a process writes to the page and access violation does not
occur. Instead, the memory manager makes a private copy of the page
for the application's use and allows the write to proceed. For
example, if two processes start from the same .EXE file, each process
initially has all pages mapped from the .EXE file copy-on-write. As
the two processes proceed to modify pages, each one receives a private
copy of the modified pages. The memory manager is free to optimize
unmodified pages and to map the same physical memory into the address
space of both processes. Modified pages are swapped to and from the
page file instead of the .EXE file.
<P>
Two types of fixups are available. The first is used for the address
of an imported function. According to the Portable Executable
specification, this type of fixup is stored in the Import Address
Table (IAT), an array of 32-bit function pointers, one for each
imported function. The IAT has its own page or pages because it is
always modified. A call to an imported function is actually an
indirect call through the appropriate entry in the IAT. When an image
is loaded at its preferred base address, imported function fixups are
the only fixups required.
<P>
Note that an optimization is available whereby each import library
exports a 32-bit number that corresponds with each function in
addition to any name or ordinal number. This serves as a "hint" to
speed the fixups performed at load time. If the hints in the
application and in the loaded DLL do not match, the loader performs a
binary search based on the function name.
<P>
The other fixup type is required for references to code or data in the
image when the image is loaded somewhere other than at its preferred
base address. When the memory manager removes a page from memory, it
checks to see of the page has been modified. If not, the page retains
its copy-on-write mapping and it can be discarded from memory.
Otherwise, it must be written to the page file so the modified page
can be recovered from the page file rather than from the executable
image file.
<P>
Even if an application calls LoadLibrary() for a DLL more than once,
the DLL entry point, DllEntry(), is called only once and only one
DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH entry is created. Similarly, if the application
calls FreeLibrary() more than once, DLL_PROCESS_DETACH occurs only for
the call in which the DLL reference count returns to zero.
<P>
Global instance data for the DLL is stored on a per-process basis
(only one data set per process). If it is necessary to store global
instance data for each LoadLibrary() call performed in one process,
consider using thread local storage (TLS) as an alternative. If you
use multiple threads of execution, TLS provides unique data storage
for each ThreadID value. This process requires very little overhead
for the DLL; it must only create a global TLS index at process
initialization. At thread initialization, use GlobalAlloc(),
HeapAlloc(), LocalAlloc(), functions in the C run-time library, or
another method to allocate a block of memory and call the
TlsSetValue() function to store a pointer to the memory using the
global TLS index value. Win32 internally stores each thread's pointer
indexed by TLS index and ThreadID to provide thread-specific storage.
