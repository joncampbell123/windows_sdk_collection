<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version 2.1
</UL> 
<P>
This article lists fixes made in version 2.1 to bugs that appeared in
Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version 2.0. This information can
also be found in the What's New help file available from Books Online or
from the initial Setup dialog box.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Bugs Fixed in Visual C++ 2.1</h3>
 
<P>
Visual C++ version 2.1 fixes several Visual C++ version 2.0 bugs. These
include bugs for hosting on Windows 95 and for double-byte character set
(DBCS) code. Many developers will find the bug fixes listed in this article
of particular interest.
<P>
<P><h3>Fixed Integrated Development Environment Bugs</h3>
 
<P>
- The thread priority is not displayed correctly. Visual C++ was using
<PRE>  ANSI_FIXED_FONT; this has been changed to SYSTEM_FIXED_FONT.

</PRE><LI>If you paste data from one window containing a document to another
   window containing the same document, the window into which you paste is
   refreshed incorrectly. This occurred in two cases: (a) when the second
   view of the document was created with the New Window command on the
   Window menu or (b) when the second view was in a splitter window.

<LI>Splitter windows in the Visual C++ source code editor exhibit incorrect
   behavior. If you split a source code window and edited one of the panes,
   the other window was repainted incorrectly.

<LI>Pasting a large bitmap from Microsoft Word version 6.0 (16 bit) into the
   Visual C++ version 2.0 bitmap editor results in a general protection
   (GP) fault. If you placed a bitmap on the clipboard from Word, opened
   the bitmap editor in Visual C++, and pasted the bitmap, a GP fault
   occurred in Visual C++. Visual C++ version 2.1 has been fixed to ignore
   the paste attempt, but even in that version, Word still cannot provide
   the bitmap.
<P>
</UL><h3>Fixed MFC Bugs</h3>
 

<UL><LI>An assertion failure occurs when using RFX_Text with a column of type
   SQL_VARCHAR that is wider than 255 bytes. Some drivers implement columns
   of type SQL_VARCHAR that allow more than 255 bytes, so in those cases,
   the MFC assertion would not be valid. For more information, please see
   the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../visualc/q120888.htm">Q120888</A></B>
<PRE>   TITLE     : FIX: Assertion Fails When Use RFX_Text() w/ SQL_VARCHAR
               Column

</PRE><LI>Calling MovePrev after you move past the end of a recordset or calling
   MoveNext after you move past the beginning of a recordset results in no
   action. You needed two MoveNext calls or two MovePrev calls to get to
   the first or last record of the recordset, respectively. Note that if
   your existing code calls either of these functions twice in a row to
   work around this problem, the code will now move an extra record.

<LI>MFC had a problem with the way the Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
   driver for Microsoft Access version 2.0 represented its Yes/No (bit)
   fields. The Microsoft Access driver mapped its Yes/No fields to the
   SQL_BINARY data type rather than SQL_BIT. This meant that MFC database
   programmers could not use BOOL for these fields in recordsets. This
   behavior was incompatible with the previous Microsoft Access driver
   version. Updated ODBC drivers now eliminate this problem.

<LI>In an application that does not use a CRecordView-derived class, MFC
   database code fails to update Null fields correctly. On a
   CRecordset::Edit call in an application not using a CRecordView, Edit
   failed to correctly update the status of fields marked Null to not Null
   and vice versa; it was necessary to explicitly set the status by calling
   the CRecordset member function SetFieldNull with the appropriate
   parameter. For more information, please see the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../visualc/q123652.htm">Q123652</A></B>
<PRE>   TITLE     : FIX: Update() Fails to Write Changed Text Field

</PRE><LI>OLE servers lost their toolbars when the container window was resized.
   If you resized the container's frame window to reduce its height, the
   server's toolbar disappeared and was replaced by the container's
   toolbar. As the frame window was made larger, the container's toolbar
   disappeared, but the server's toolbar did not reappear.

<LI>The pvarResult from COleDispatchDriver::InvokeHelper should be NULL when
   vtRet is VT_EMPTY. But a call to COleDispatchDriver::InvokeHelper caused
   the server to generate an error when the return type was VT_EMPTY. The
   nature of the error depended on the automation server. For example, the
   Microsoft WordBasic automation server caused the following error on some
   methods with a return type of void (_DEBUG build): "Assertion Failed
   Line 315, OLEDISP2.CPP." Using the debugger to examine the excepInfo
   structure showed that the btrDescription member contained this message:
   "Non Function called as function." For more information, please see the
   following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../visualc/q121218.htm">Q121218</A></B>
<PRE>   TITLE     : FIX: pvarResult Should Be NULL When vtRet==VT_EMPTY

</PRE><LI>The CMainView::DoPasteNative member function in the OCLIENT sample
   application failed to handle an error, which caused a failure. The
   function returned without throwing an exception when the pFile variable
   was NULL. This has been corrected to throw a CFileException.

<LI>A default OLE container application with OLE Automation enabled
   initialized the m_pSelection data member in the wrong function.
   AppWizard initialized the member to NULL in the view's nInitialUpdate
   member function rather than in the view constructor. This led to an
   assertion failure in COleClientItem::OnDraw when you attempted to create
   a container document with another application, as for example using
   Visual Basic's CreateObject function. The member is now correctly
   initialized in both places. (This bug applies to both 16- and 32-bit
   versions.)

<LI>The ANSI mapping layer in MFCANS32.DLL handled standard OLE aggregation
   incorrectly. The DLL incorrectly called AddRef where it should not have
   under aggregation rules. There was also a problem with how MFC wrapped
   the "inner IUnknown." For more information, see Technical Note 49 under
   MFC in Books Online.

<LI>COleDataSource::OnRenderData returned NOERROR instead of TRUE. Because
   the function return type is prototyped as BOOL, NOERROR is interpreted
   as FALSE. (This bug applies to both 16- and 32-bit versions.)

<LI>The EXCEPINFO structure is not correctly initialized for an OLE control.
   Information already available about an exception -- in particular, the
   control name and the name of the control's help file -- was overwritten.
   This has been corrected so that the EXCEPINFO structure is only filled
   if it is empty. (This bug applies to both 16- and 32-bit versions.)

<LI>When Microsoft Excel deactivated an in-place object whose frame window
   has a splitter that contained two or more views, the MFC application
   caused a general protection fault. The COleServerDoc::OnShowDocument
   function destroyed the frame window in this case, leading to the general
   protection fault. This applied only to SDI-based in-place servers.

<LI>The wrong window was determined to be the active window when the HIERSVR
   sample application was embedded in Microsoft Excel. When you used Edit
   Insert in Excel to insert a HIERSVR object, selected the object, then
   chose any command that opened a dialog box, the dialog box had the wrong
   parent. The parent was in Excel, not HIERSVR. The m_pActiveWnd data
   member needed to be set back to NULL once an object left the UI-active
   state. This was true for both 16- and 32-bit Excel. (This bug applies to
   both 16- and 32-bit versions of Visual C++.)

<LI>Removing FWS_ADDTOTITLE caused an incorrect SaveModified call. Removing
   the FWS_ADDTOTITLE style from a CMDIChildWnd-derived class caused
   SaveModified to be called when each view attached to the document was
   closed. This caused a problem in closing the frame window. For more
   information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
   Base:
<P>
   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../visualc/q99182.htm">Q99182</A></B>
<PRE>   TITLE     : How to Change an MFC-Based MDI Child Window's Frame Text

</PRE><LI>The CMDIFrameWnd caption was not updated when a maximized child window
   closed. Under certain circumstances, closing a maximized child window
   did not properly update the caption of the main frame window in a
   multiple document interface (MDI) application. This caused the main
   frame window caption to show a document name even with no documents
   open. The bug appeared when the child window was maximized and the main
   frame window was narrower than its menu bar, so the menu wrapped to the
   next line.

<LI>The command update handler for a menu item was not called if you added
   or removed the previous menu item during a command handler call. If you
   added or removed a menu item during a command handler call, the update
   handler was not called for the menu item immediately following the added
   or removed item. For example, menu items below the most-recently-used
   (MRU) list on the File menu could be affected by this problem.

<LI>Problems occurred when you used width specifiers in CString::Format. In
   the CString::Format member function, using a negative width specifier in
   a %s metacharacter that was larger than the actual length of the string
   being substituted led to an assertion failure in file: STREX.CPP, Line
   360. You might have a metacharacter like this if you wanted the string
   to be left-justified within the number of columns you specified as the
   width.

<LI>CString::Format resulted in a general protection (GP) fault if variable
   width or precision specifiers were used. Format did not correctly handle
   variable width or precision parameters, such as %*d, which caused an
   Access Violation.

<LI>The tab control didn't invalidate after adding a tab to a property
   sheet. If you added a CPropertyPage via CPropertySheet::AddPage while
   the CPropertySheet was displayed, the tab control did not update to
   reflect the change. The tab control needed to be invalidated. This is
   similar to the behavior of CTabControl::RemoveTab.

<LI>When the last control on a property page had the WS_TABSTOP style, but
   was hidden, tabbing from the next-to-last control jumped to the first
   control on the page. The expected behavior would be to go to the first
   control on the associated property sheet (usually below the property
   pages). Note that the correction for this behavior does not affect
   existing code.

<LI>An edit control in a property page did not get Return keys. A multiline
   edit control with the ES_WANTRETURN style set did not receive return-key
   messages (WM_KEYDOWN with VK_RETURN) when placed in a CPropertyPage
   object. If the parent CPropertySheet object contained a button with an
   ID that was IDOK, the dialog box was dismissed when the return key was
   pressed in the edit control. For more information, please see the
   following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../visualc/q125645.htm">Q125645</A></B>
<PRE>   TITLE     : FIX: Edit Control in Property Page Does Not Get Return Keys

</PRE><LI>Problems occurred after destroying a dockable CControlBar object. When
   the CControlBar object was destroyed, its destructor did not remove the
   control bar from an array of control bar pointers kept by MFC in a
   CDockBar object. In some situations, this led to an exception caused by
   an Access Violation in the function CObject::IsKindOf. For more
   information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
   Base:
<P>
   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../visualc/q125728.htm">Q125728</A></B>
<PRE>   TITLE     : FIX: Problems Occur After Destroying Dockable CControlBar

</PRE><LI>In applications that called CFrameWnd::LoadBarState, restoring the
   docking state resulted in a disabled toolbar. If you added code that
   called LoadBarState and your dockable toolbar did not have the style
   CBRS_DOCKMULTI, LoadBarState caused the toolbar to be disabled the next
   time you ran the application -- if in the previous session, you hid the
   toolbar while it was floating and closed the application. AppWizard
   applications do not set this style and do not call LoadBarState, so they
   did not encounter this problem.

<LI>While being loaded, an MFC _USRDLL could cause an assertion failure if
   the DLL filename had an extension of fewer than three characters. The
   assertion, which occurred in CWinApp::SetCurrentHandles, was incorrect.
   DLL filename extensions are not required to be three characters long,
   nor must they be "DLL" or any other specific string. However, some
   environments do require a specific extension, such as the "WLL"
   extension for Microsoft Word add-ins. This assertion was removed for MFC
   versions 3.1 and 2.52.

<LI>The implementation for the class CMap template could compare keys
   incorrectly. The CMap implementation needed to use CompareElements to
   compare keys. This correction allows greater flexibility in implementing
   the comparison function.

<LI>Memory could leak in a CMap object when the KEY parameter was of type
   CString. Removing all elements in the map resulted in deleting only the
   values stored in the map, not the keys used to look values up. The fix
   allows greater flexibility in implementing the comparison function.
<P>
</UL><h3>Fixed Compiler Bugs</h3>
 

<UL><LI>The compiler treated pointer types as the corresponding base type in
   template specializations. For example, given this template
   specialization:
<P>
<P><PRE>      template&lt;class T&gt; T dFriendFunc(Derived&lt;T&gt; *);
</PRE><P>
<PRE>   char* was treated as char, and int* was treated as int. The compiler did
   not deduce the template arguments correctly. This caused an error
   because two functions appeared to differ only in their return types.

</PRE><LI>Problems occurred when exceptions were thrown across DLL boundaries.
   Throwing an object that was exported resulted in an Access Violation.
   Visual C++ version 2.1 allows you to catch object defined in a DLL
   outside the context of the defining DLL. For more information, please
   wee the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../visualc/q122303.htm">Q122303</A></B>
<PRE>   TITLE     : BUG: __declspec(dllimport) Classes Are Not Caught Correctly

</PRE><LI>The Compiler returned no warning on an attempt to return a temporary
   variable from a function. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      int a = 5;
      return &amp;a;
</PRE><P>
   The compiler shipped with Visual C++ version 2.1 now issues a warning'
   for the return value.
<P>
</UL><h3>Fixed Linker Bugs</h3>
 

<UL><LI>LineNum information was incorrect when converting from 32-bit Object
   Module Format (OMF) to Common Object File Format (COFF). The linker
   incorrectly converted 32-bit OMF LINENUM records to COFF. This showed up
   in the debugger as incorrect line numbers; the conversion is now
   correct. For more information, please wee the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../masm/q117796.htm">Q117796</A></B>
<PRE>   TITLE     : PRB: Incorrect Debug Information in 32-bit Object Module

</PRE><LI>An error occurred in the incremental linker when processing large
   images but few relocations. This condition resulted in this message:
<P>
   ***** Linker INTERNAL ERROR during EmitRelocations *****
<P>
   The problem leading to this message has been corrected.
<P>
</UL><h3>Fixed Run-Time Library Bugs</h3>
 

<UL><LI>The tolower and toupper functions were not locale sensitive on the
   Intel platform. The functions incorrectly used the "C" locale regardless
   of what the locale was.

<LI>Using a pointer to a virtual base class object while catching an
   exception resulted in an Application Error when the derived class used
   multiple inheritance. This has been corrected.

<LI>An incorrect heap region size was set under Win32s. Win32s initially did
   not support reserved but uncommitted virtual memory. A code check in
   Visual C++ used to limit the maximum total size of the CRTL heap under
   Win32s. This check has been removed, so applications running under
   Win32s or Phar Lap TNT will be able to allocate approximately as much
   total memory as under Windows NT or Windows 95. The initial heap regions
   will be smaller under Win32s or Phar Lap TNT than under Windows NT or
   Windows 95.

<LI>The _ecvt function returned the wrong number of digits in the overflow
   case. If you called _ecvt asking for n digits and the function
   overflowed, it returned n+1 digits. For example, _ecvt returned 1000
   instead of 100. If your code expected three digits, it might use 000,
   the last three of the four digits returned, instead of 100.

<LI>There was a memory leak in the client DLLs of MSVCRT20.DLL. Suppose
   EXAMPLE.DLL was a client of MSVCRT20.DLL and a client .EXE loaded and
   unloaded EXAMPLE.DLL a number of times. The failure in Visual C++ to
   deallocate a small block of memory in MSVCRT20.DLL could lead to a
   memory leak.
<P>
</UL><h3>Fixed Resource Compiler Bugs</h3>
 

<UL><LI>The Resource Compiler required 16 megabytes of virtual memory on
   startup. This requirement forced you to close applications or increase
   the size of the Windows swap file to allow the resource compiler to
   load. A new version of the resource compiler reduces this requirement.
