The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 4.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to troubleshoot setup problems with Visual C++,
32-bit Edition, in Windows NT. Because most developers are more familiar
with troubleshooting 16-bit problems, this article also mentions 16-bit
methods that do not carry over to 32-bit setup troubleshooting.
<P>
Slight differences in a Visual C++ 5.0 or 4.0 setup versus Visual C++ 2.0
setup (such as the presence of an uninstall program) are noted here.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The majority of 32-bit setup problems can be broken down into two areas:

<UL><LI>Hardware failures, problems, or incompatibilities.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Bad or Corrupt installations.
<P>
</UL>Each area is discussed in detail later in this article.
<P>
Use the following general process to troubleshoot Visual C++ setup problems
in Windows NT:

<OL><P><LI>If you receive an error message from the setup program or some other
   component of Visual C++, try to search the Microsoft Knowledge Base for
   a list of known problems by using words from that error message. The
   Microsoft Knowledge Base (KB) is available on the services listed in the
   "References" section at the end of this article.
<P>
   The KB is a dynamic collection of articles. Significant new articles
   and updated information is added daily. A snap shot of the Visual C++
   4.0 Knowledge Base is available on the product CD-ROM compact disc
   itself through the integrated development environment.

<P><LI>After running setup, if Visual C++ will not run at all, test the
   hardware first by using ideas from the "Hardware Failures, Problems, or
   Incompatibilities" section of this article. Then try using ideas from
   the "Bad Software Installation" section of this article if necessary.

<P><LI>If Visual C++ starts but does not work correctly, first test the
   installation using the information in the "Bad Software Installation"
   section of this article. Then try the "Hardware Failures, Problems, or
   Incompatibilities" section of this article if necessary.
<P>
</OL><h2>HARDWARE FAILURES, PROBLEMS, OR INCOMPATIBILITIES</h2>
 
<P>
The problems you're experiencing may also show up in other applications.
However, even if you are not having trouble with other CD-ROM-based
applications, that does not necessarily mean that you won't have one of the
problem discussed in this section.
<P>
First, check the Event Log with the Event Log Viewer application located in
the Administrative Tools program group. The Event Log records a number of
actions that your Windows NT system performs, including many hardware and
software failures. Bad events are usually shown by a stop sign icon on the
right side of the list. By default, the list is sorted by date.
<P>
If you see a number of stop signs for the same service or device, that
sometimes indicates a hardware problem. Double-click the events to see if
they all hold the same or related messages that indicate hardware device
failures. Note, however, that even if there are no stop signs in the Event
List, you may still have a hardware problem that was not detected by
Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Process</h3>
 
<P>
Failures of the CD-ROM drive or hard disk system are the most frequently
encountered cause of setup problems. Check for possible causes in this
order:

<OL><P><LI>Check for a bad SCSI termination. Most SCSI drives require a SCSI bus
   terminator on the end of the SCSI cable. Event Log time-out events or a
   number of the same type of failures from the SCSI or disk drive device
   can be an indication that the SCSI bus has a missing or incorrect
   termination resistor.

<P><LI>Check to see if your hardware is on the Hardware Compatibility List
   (HCL). The HCL can be found in Help file format in the Support directory
   of the Windows NT distribution disk. Make sure all hardware drivers are
   correct and compatible with Windows NT. Check the HCL for your machine
   manufacturer, your hard disk maker, and your CD-ROM manufacturer. A
   number of IDE drives have been known to cause problems in Windows NT.
   Check the HCL or your dealer for the components in question. Microsoft
   specifically tested Windows NT with the devices on the HCL list, so
   hardware on the list is known to function correctly under Windows NT.
<P>
   Contacting the device controller manufacturer for updated drivers and/or
   firmware is always a good idea when incompatibilities are found, even
   for hardware not on the HCL list.
<P>
   You may also have other driver problems that only show up because of
   memory conflicts with the CD-ROM driver or some other driver. Windows NT
   is a symmetric multiprocessor operating system that can take advantage
   of multiple CPUs. Some drivers are not designed to run on multiprocessor
   computers. If you have a computer with more than one processor, check
   with the driver's manufacturer to be sure it will function properly.
   Visual C++ and the Visual C++ setup do not have any known problems
   running on multiprocessor machines.
<P>
   You may also have loaded the wrong driver when you installed Windows NT.
   If Windows NT did not automatically detect the hardware on your machine,
   make sure you loaded the right drivers for your hardware.

<P><LI>Check for bad sectors on your hard disk. Run Chkdsk from within a
   Windows NT MS-DOS command prompt. If you find errors, fix them with
   Chkdsk /f. To check for a media surface problem, use Chkdsk /r to do a
   surface scan of the drive in question.
<P>
   You may receive a message stating that the volume cannot be scanned
   because it is currently in use. Answer Yes to the question of whether
   you would like to schedule this drive for checking on the next system
   startup. In this case, Windows NT will perform the check and/or fix the
   next time you reboot. Shut down and restart the system to allow the
   check to occur.
<P>
   These commands check the integrity of the file system and check the hard
   disk surface itself for physical defects that may cause data loss.
   Chkdsk /r is the equivalent of the using the MS-DOS Scandisk program.
   Scandisk will not run under Windows NT or on an NTFS or HPFS drive while
   the machine is booted into MS-DOS.
<P>
   NOTE: This operation can take some time depending on the size of your
   hard disk.

<P><LI>Check for corrupted files on the hard disk. These problems are often
   caused by the problems listed in steps 1 through 3. However, corrupted
   files can also be caused by CD-ROM or hard disk drivers when the files
   are created during the CD-ROM to hard drive copying process. This
   corruption usually shows up when setup runs without errors but some
   component of Visual C++ will not run.
<P>
   For more complete information on troubleshooting CD-ROM problems in
   Windows or Windows NT, please see the following articles in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../zmiscellaneous/q94653.htm">Q94653</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Using FC.EXE to Verify CD-ROM File System Drivers

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q126380.htm">Q126380</A></B>
      TITLE     : Troubleshooting CD-ROM Problems in Windows NT

   Use the MS-DOS or Windows NT File Compare program (Fc.exe) to compare
   the files that have been copied from your CD-ROM drive to your hard
   drive as follows:

      FC /b [drive1:][path1]filename1 [drive2:][path2]filename2

   The /B (binary) switch tells the File Compare program to run a binary
   compare on the files. Comparing the files in the Bin subdirectory of the
   Visual C++ installation (\Msvc20\Bin or \MSDEV\BIN by default) with the
   Corresponding directory on the CD-ROM disc will generally tell you
   fairly quickly if you have a problem.

   Note that the Visual C++ version 5.0 installation binds most of the EXEs
   and DLLs for address fix up to achieve a faster startup of the Developer
   Studio shell. For this reason, file compare cannot be used to check for
   corrupted files in version 5.0.

   NOTE: There are two files (Msvcshl.dll and Spyxx.exe) in the Bin
   subdirectory that FC.exe will report as different. These two files are
   modified as part of the installation process, and are therefore expected
   to be different.

   If no errors are found in the Bin directory, check the entire Visual C++
   installation using Fc.exe if Visual C++ still won't run.

   If Fc.exe reports differences, be sure you have checked the problems
   listed in steps 1 through 3. If these do not apply, your CD-ROM driver
   is likely the cause. You have three choices at this point:

   a. To be absolutely sure, delete the Visual C++ directory on your hard
      drive and reinstall. Then use Fc.exe to check the installation again.
      If you still receive a report of differences try one of the following
      two choices.

   b. If there are only a few corrupted files, use the Xcopy command to
      copy the files from the CD-ROM disc to the destination location. Use
      the Fc.exe command to compare the files again.

   c. If you can, transfer the entire Msvc20 directory tree to a another
      installation location. If you are on a network and have sufficient
      hard drive space, use another computer with a working CD-ROM drive to
      copy the Msvc20 tree to the hard drive. Then share out the hard
      drive, and try to install the product from there. Use Xcopy /s to
      copy the Msvc20 tree from the CD-ROM disc to your hard drive. Type
      Xcopy /? at Windows NT command prompt for more information on using
      Xcopy. The directories for version 4.0 is MSDEV, and the directory
      for 5.0 is DEVSTUDIO. It may be advisable to copy the whole CD
      image instead because, there are other components which are installed
      for these two versions.

      Alternatively, you can share out the CD-ROM drive on the other
      machine and install from there.

      NOTE: You cannot install using a UNC connection with versions before
      Visual C++ 4.0.. You must connect to the hard drive using a NET USE
      command/File Manager/Explorer. For more information, please
      see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE><P><LI>Check for a bad CD-ROM compact disc. This is unlikely yet still
   possible. Verify that the CD-ROM compact disc is bad by doing one
   of the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Wipe the CD-ROM disc gently with a soft cloth to remove any smudges,
      dust, or fingerprints. Be careful not to scratch it. Wiping outward
      from the center is the recommended method for cleaning a CD-ROM disc.
      Any scratches produced will be radial and less likely to affect data
      transfers. Inspect the CD-ROM disc for deep scratches. These can also
      cause read errors. Often these errors will show up in the Event Log
      as read errors from the disk drive device.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If another machine with a different CD-ROM drive is available,
      install on that machine, and see if the installation works. If it
      does, you've verified that your CD-ROM disc is not the problem.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If you have another Visual C++ CD-ROM disc for the same Visual C++
      version, use Fc.exe to compare the two for possible differences. You
      could also install from this second CD-ROM disc. If everything
      installs and works, then it is probable that the first one is bad.
      Call Visual C++ Product Support at the number included in your
      documentation that comes with the product. Be sure to be prepared to
      repeat the tests that led you to the conclusion that your CD-ROM disc
      was bad.

<P><h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Process</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Check the Microsoft Knowledge Base for known problems before
   troubleshooting a problem that Microsoft has already tracked for you.
   The Microsoft Knowledge Base is available on the services listed in the
   "References" section at the end of this article.

<P><LI>Check for Visual C++ corrupted Registry entries. If you are not familiar
   with the Registry, be very careful following these instructions.
   Deleting the wrong registry keys can cause many more problems.
<P>
   Registry entries may be viewed or edited by using Regedt32.exe, which
   comes with Windows NT. The registry is a database designed to hold
   information about your entire Windows NT system. Visual C++ and other
   Microsoft applications store configuration information in this area. For
   version 2.0, you will find this information in the following key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Visual C++ 2.0
</PRE><P>
   The 2.1 and 2.2 updates still use this key. A new registry entry with
   all default values is generated the first time you run Visual C++ if
   there is no registry entry for it.
<P>
   For you to see this information, HKEY_CURRENT_USER must be the window in
   focus. The other keys (Software, Microsoft, and so on) are contained in
   a tree structure similar to the directory structure shown in File
   Manager. You can select a registry key by using the mouse. Double-click
   the key to open up any other branches below it.
<P>
   Visual C++ version 4.0 uses the following registry keys:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\InfoViewer
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Developer
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\InfoViewer
</PRE><P>
   For the standard version of 4.0, the registry keys are:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\DeveloperStd
      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\InfoViewer
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\DeveloperStd
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\InfoViewer
</PRE><P>
   For version 5.0, the registry keys are:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\DevStudio\5.0
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\DevStudio\5.0
      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\InfoViewer\5.0
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\ InfoViewer\5.0
</PRE><P>
   Other developer packages also use this these registry keys, so deleting
   the entire key may make other developer applications nonfunctional.
   It is best to use the Visual C++ uninstall program to remove version 4.0
   and 5.0 installation and registry information.
<P>
   Other developer packages also use this registry key, so deleting
   the entire key may make other developer applications nonfunctional.
   It best to use the Visual C++ uninstall program to remove version 4.0
   installation and registry information.
<P>
   NOTE: Before trying this step, be certain that you have the correct key
   selected (highlighted). If you delete another key, you may destroy
   valuable information that your system or another application needs to
   run.
<P>
   You can delete the Visual C++ registry tree by selecting it and then
   clicking Delete on the menu. When this key is removed, Visual C++ can
   still be run, but it may not have some of its parameters set properly.
<P>
   Running parts of the Visual C++ interface may restore some of the
   registry keys to their default values, but rerunning setup is the only
   way to fully restore the registry. If you just need the registry entries
   and/or program groups regenerated, it's best to run the 32-bit setup in
   the Msvc20 directory on the Visual C++ CD-ROM disc with the /F option.
   Running the global setup in the root directory of the CD-ROM disc will
   not pass the /F option on to any other spawned setups. The /F option is
   useful because the icon groups and registry entries are recreated but no
   files are actually be copied to the hard drive. Be careful to chose the
   same options that you chose when you did the original file copy
   installation, or Visual C++ may not work correctly. Go to the MSDEV
   directory for version 4.0 and the DEVSTUDIO directory for version 5.0.
<P>
   If the problem is not fixed by deleting just the registry entries, the
   next easiest step is to delete the entire Msvc20 or MSDEV or DEVSTUDIO
   directory tree and also delete the Visual C++ registry Key as noted
   above. Reinstall Visual C++ and test the installation again.
<P>
   Again, in Visual C++ 4.0 and 5.0, use the unistall feature to remove
   registry entries.

<P><LI>Check for other corrupted Registry entries. To test this possibility,
   create a new user account by clicking New User on the User Menu in the
   User Manager application; User Manager is usually in the Administrative
   Tools group icon. Then install Visual C++ when the new user is logged
   in. You can use setup with the /F option, but keep the limitations
   described previously in mind.
<P>
   If the software installs or runs correctly on the new account, the
   problem is most likely caused by bad registry entries on the old
   account. If the problem persists on the new account, the registry is
   probably not a factor.

<P><LI>Check for other bugs or problems with setup. Search using vc20setup,
   vc40setup, or vc50setup in the Microsoft Knowledge Base for a list of
   known issues with the 32-bit  Visual C++ setup program.  Then read the
   following section for other possible hints.
<P>
</OL><h2>OTHER TROUBLESHOOTING INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In 16-bit Windows, one of the first strategies to try in diagnosing setup
problems is starting the computer in a "clean boot" configuration, which
means all unnecessary commands are removed from the Config.sys and
Autoexec.bat files. For more information about this, please see the
following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win3x/q80448.htm">Q80448</A></B>
   TITLE     : What Is a Clean Boot for Windows 3.0?

</PRE></OL>Under Windows NT, a clean boot is not the same thing. The following
information was extracted from the Windows NT 3.5 Resource Kit
Documentation:
<P>
During system startup, Windows NT adds any Path, Prompt, and Set commands
from the C:\Autoexec.bat file to the Windows NT environment variables, and
then ignores the rest of the contents of C:\Autoexec.bat and C:\Config.sys.
If these files are not present when you install Windows NT, the Setup
program creates them. For a RISC-based computer, default Autoexec.nt and
Config.nt files are created. The path and other Windows NT environment
information are stored under the following Registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet
       \Control\Session Manager\Environment

</PRE>When an MS-DOS-based application is started, Windows NT executes files
specified in the application's .pif files or the Autoexec.nt and Config.nt
files in the SystemRoot\System32 directory. Any changes made in one of
these files take effect as soon as the file is saved and a new MS-DOS-based
application is started that uses that file. You do not need to restart your
system after changing the *.nt files.
<P>
<PRE>File                         Use in Windows NT
</PRE> 
<PRE>C:\Autoexec.bat              Path and environment variables added to
                             the Windows NT environment at system
                             startup.


C:\Config.sys                Not used by Windows NT.

Autoexec.nt and Config.nt    Files used every time an MS-DOS-based
                             application in SystemRoot\SYSTEM32 is run
                             with the _Default.pif. (Custom *.nt files
                             can be created and used when starting an
                             application from another .pif file.)

</PRE>You can use Windows NT Diagnostics to view the contents of the Autoexec.nt
files and the Config.nt files by clicking items on the File menu. You
can edit the contents of these files by using any text editor.
<P>
Commands in the Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files for starting applications
and initializing drivers are ignored in Windows NT.
<P>
It's important to note that different settings are used for MS-DOS-based
and 32-bit console applications. Cl.exe and Link.exe are 32-bit
DOS-extended applications, which means they load and run under Windows NT
as native (console) applications. Currently, the only MS-DOS process
invoked by the 32-bit edition of Visual C++ is the resource compiler
(Rc.exe).

</PRE>Note that the information that used to be stored in the Win.ini and
System.ini files has been replaced by registry entries, so making
modifications to these files will not affect Windows NT itself. However,
many 16-bit applications, including Visual C++ version 1.5x, still use
System.ini for configuration information.
