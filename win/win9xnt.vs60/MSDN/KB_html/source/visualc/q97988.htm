<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The AppWizard included with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An attempt to use the AppWizard provided with Microsoft Visual C++
version 1.0 to generate a new application on a Novell network may fail
and AppWizard may display the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Error Generating new app

</PRE>Most often, the error occurs when the AppWizard creates the README.TXT
file but the message can appear when AppWizard creates other files as
well.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
By default, Novell NetWare searches a user's path when it looks for a
data file to open. If a user has a file in a directory on the search
path that has the same name as a file that AppWizard attempts to
create, NetWare attempts to open the existing file rather than
creating a new file in the current directory. If the user does not
have the necessary rights to open the existing file for write access,
the open fails and the error message above is generated.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Perform one of the following four steps to work around this situation:

<UL><LI>Temporarily delete the search drive mapping that points to the
   directory that contains the file that causes this problem. The
   Novell MAP command modifies search drive mappings. See below for
   additional information on using the MAP command to delete a search
   drive mapping.

<LI>Use AppWizard to create the new application on a local drive rather
   than on a remote network drive. Once AppWizard has generated the
   files for the application, copy them to the remote drive on the
   server.
<P>
   In Visual Workbench (VWB), when you first open the copied project
   on the remote drive, VWB displays a message to indicate that the
   project was moved from the drive on which it was originally
   created.

<LI>Have the system administrator or a user with the necessary rights
   temporarily rename the file in the directory in the user's search
   path that causes this problem. After you generate the project, have
   the administrator return the file to its original name.

<LI>If the README.TXT file causes this behavior, you can disable
   generating that file. To do so, choose the Options button in App
   Wizard. In the Options dialog box, remove the selection from the
   Generate Source Comments option.

<LI>The README.TXT file that the AppWizard generates describes each
   file generated in a new project. The README.TXT file is not
   required to build the new project.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The NetWare MAP command can delete a search drive mapping. To see the
search drive mappings currently in effect, enter the following command
at the MS-DOS command prompt:
<P>
<PRE>    MAP

</PRE>MAP should display a list similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>    Drive  A:   maps to a local disk.
    Drive  B:   maps to a local disk.
    Drive  C:   maps to a local disk.
    Drive  D:   maps to a local disk.
    Drive  E:   maps to a local disk.
    Drive  F: = SERVER\SYS: \USER
          -----
    SEARCH1:  = c:\dos
    SEARCH2:  = Z:.  [SERVER\SYS:  \PUBLIC]
    SEARCH3:  = Y:.  [SERVER\SYS:  \LOGIN]
    SEARCH4:  = X:.  [SERVER\SYS:  \APPS\MSVC\BIN]
    SEARCH5:  = W:.  [SERVER\SYS:  \WINDOWS]

</PRE>To delete a search drive mapping, use the MAP command with the
following syntax:
<P>
<PRE>    MAP DEL SEARCH&lt;n&gt;:

</PRE>where &lt;n&gt; is the number of the search drive to delete. For example, to
delete search drive mapping two, use the following command:
<P>
<PRE>    MAP DEL SEARCH2:
</PRE> 
<PRE>Keywords          : kb16bitonly
Version           : 1.0 1.5</PRE>
