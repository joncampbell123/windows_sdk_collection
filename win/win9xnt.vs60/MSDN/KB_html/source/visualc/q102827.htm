<UL><LI>The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), included with:
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.51, 1.52

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The SPLIT sample demonstrates the following Foundation Class programming
concepts:

<OL><P><LI>A ReplaceView() function can be created which replaces a view in a
   CSplitterWnd pane with another. The function replaces a view but uses
   the same CDocument object. This function can be helpful if a programmer
   wants to keep the same frame window and document for a splitter pane and
   only wants to delete a view in a pane and replace it with another.

<P><LI>The CDocument variable m_bAutoDelete can be used to prevent the
   destruction of a CDocument object if all views of the document are
   destroyed.

<P><LI>The CWnd::PreCreateWindow() function can be used to prevent the main
   application from having a thick frame thus preventing the user from
   resizing the main application window.

<P><LI>By trapping the WM_SETCURSOR, WM_MOUSEMOVE, and WM_LBUTTONDOWN messages
   of a CSplitterWnd, you can fix the splitter bars in a splitter window so
   that they can't be moved by the user.

<P><LI>CSplitterWnd panes can contain regular CWnd objects and are not limited
   to the use of CViews. This sample places a dialog in the first pane.

<P><LI>The undocumented CWnd::CenterWindow() can be used to position windows at
   the center of the screen.

<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To understand what the sample does, first execute the program. You will see
a main application window with a splitter window (CSplitterWnd) in its
client area. A selection dialog will be displayed in the first pane and a
view will be displayed in the second pane.
<P>
Click on the "View 1" and "View 2" buttons. Notice that the view in the
second pane will switch from one to the other. The view is changing but
looking at the source you'll see that the document stays the same.
<P>
The sample project can be converted to a 32-bit Visual C++ 2.x project and
will successfully compile and execute once the following change has been
made:
<P>
On line 34 of SPLITTER.CPP, change:
<P>
<PRE>   ::SetWindowWord
   GWW_ID

</PRE>to:
<P>
<PRE>   ::SetWindowLong
   GWL_ID

</PRE>If you have comments or suggestions about how to improve this sample,
please send Microsoft a message to the MFC section of the MSLANG forum.
