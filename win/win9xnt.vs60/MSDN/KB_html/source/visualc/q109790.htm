The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) included with:
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0
    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.51, 1.52
    - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 4.0

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The CTimeSpan::GetDays function seems to incorrectly report that the number
of days between April 1 and May 1 is 29, instead of 30.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior of the CTimeSpan::GetDays function is by design. One day in
April is the start of Daylight Savings Time. On that day, there are only 23
hours, instead of the normal 24. Because of the way the CTimeSpan::GetDays
member function is implemented, a day with less than 24 hours is not a
complete day.
<P>
Because the time span is figured in seconds, the time span for a month is
the sum of all the seconds in a month. The definition of
CTimeSpan::GetDays() in AFX.INL (located in the MFC\INCLUDE sub-directory
of the Visual C++ installation directory)calculates the number of days by
dividing the value of the m_timeSpan member variable by the number of
seconds in a day. Thus, if one day in a 30-day month has 23 hours (which is
the case here), m_timeSpan will be short by 3600 seconds, and the result of
the division will be 29 (days), rather than 30. This is a characteristic of
integer division in C/C++ where the remainder is truncated.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two workarounds:

<UL><LI>If you are interested only in the precision of the number of days, add
   3600 seconds to the instance of CTimeSpan. This ensures that the April
   case is handled appropriately, and that other calculations will not be
   affected, as a characteristic of integer division. Adding 3600 seconds
   (one hour) to a CTimeSpan instance will not affect measurement in days
   even in the worst case of a time span being some multiple of 86400
   seconds (one day), because a day with one hour is not a full day.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use the TZ environment variable to control how time calculations are
   handled by MFC. The TZ environment variable can be set from the command
   line (such as in AUTOEXEC.BAT), or it can be set with the _putenv()
   function. The documentation for the TZ environment variable [in the
   online help or the "Run-Time Library Reference," under _tzset()], states
   that the default value of TZ is PST8PDT, which corresponds to the
   Pacific time zone.
<P>
   To work around the problem at hand, just set ONLY the tzn (three letter
   time zone) and hh (difference in hours between Universal Coordinated
   Time/Greenwich Mean Time) fields of the TZ variable. For example, if
   you are in the Eastern Time Zone, and set the TZ variable to EST5, then
   Daylight Savings Time would not be taken into account when doing CTime
   and CTimeSpan calculations.
<P>
   NOTE: You MUST set the TZ variable before doing ANY time calculations,
   including initialization of CTime objects. Try moving the _putenv() call
   in the following code to demonstrate this. A good place to set the TZ
   environment variable is in the application's InitInstance() function.
<P>
</UL><h3>Sample Code</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   void CDialogsApp::OnTimeDaysInApril()
   {
       // Set TZ environment variable.
       if (_putenv("TZ=PST8")==-1)
        // Can't set variable.
        AfxMessageBox("Unable to set TZ environment variable",MB_OK);
       else {
        // Variable set, show its effect!
        CTime t1(1993,4,1,0,0,0);   // April 1, 1993, 12:00:00 am
        CTime t2(1993,5,1,0,0,0);   // May 1, 1993, 12:00:00 am
        // Calculate time span.
        CTimeSpan ts = t2 - t1;
        LONG lNumDays=ts.GetDays();
        // Output message.
        char buffer[40];
        wsprintf(buffer,"Days in April: %ld",lNumDays);
        AfxMessageBox(buffer,MB_OK);
       }
   }
