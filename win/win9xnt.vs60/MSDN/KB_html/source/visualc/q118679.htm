SYMPTOMS
 
<P>
When you release dynamically allocated memory back to the system by using
the C++ delete operator in a QuickWin application, a memory leak occurs.
<P>
CAUSE
 
<P>
The run-time library provides four versions of the delete operator to
deallocate pointers that are near, far, huge, or based. The version that is
selected depends on the addressing mode of pointer. For example, if the
pointer is a near pointer, the near delete operator is called. If the
addressing mode of pointer does not reflect the version of the new operator
used to allocate the memory, the incorrect version of the delete operator
is called. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   Node __far *fpN;
   fpN = new Node __near;  // convert near to far
   delete fpn;             // far delete invoked for near object

</PRE>Here, the compiler chooses the inappropriate delete operator for the
pointer, which results in a run-time error.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem, explicitly cast the pointer to the addressing mode
you want:
<P>
<PRE>   delete (Node __near *)fpN;

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following sample code can be used to demonstrate the memory leak.
Replace the last two uncommented lines with the commented lines to see the
correct output.

<P><h3>Sample Code</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   /* Compile options needed: /Mq
   */

   #include &lt;malloc.h&gt;
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

   void main()
   {
      char * nearptr;
      char far * farptr;

      printf("\n");
      printf("Starting memory: %u\n",_memavl());

      nearptr = new char;
      farptr = new char __near; // new returns a near pointer
      printf("After memory allocated: memavl=%u\n",_memavl());

      delete nearptr; // the near delete gets called

      delete farptr;  // the far delete gets called for near memory
      printf("After memory is freed : memavl=%u\n",_memavl());

      //delete ( char __near *) farptr; // this will call the correct
   delete
      //printf("After memory is freed : memavl=%u\n",_memavl());
   }
