The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE), included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft C/C++ for MS-DOS, versions 7.0
    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.0 and 1.5
</UL></PRE>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There is a documentation error relating to the use of Windows
entry/exit code optimization switches for Microsoft C/C++ versions 7.0
and 8.0. The article below corrects this and provides additional
information about the use of the following switches:
<P>
<PRE>   /GA /GD /GEf /Gw /GW /Gq

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
With Microsoft C/C++ versions 7.0 and 8.0, the documentation for the
/Gw and /GW switches is incorrect in both the online help and the
"Microsoft C/C++ Environment and Tools" manual on page 522 and the
"Command Line User's Guide" manual starting on page 143. The section
on /Gw and /GW incorrectly states that /Gw works only on functions
explicitly marked as __export, while /GW works on those not marked as
__export. In fact, neither switch is affected by the presence or
absence of __export. Both switches only affect __far functions and
ignore __near functions.
<P>
The /GA and /GD functions do require that functions be explicitly
marked as __export if the switch is to affect them.
<P>
As stated in the documentation, /Gw, /GW, and /Gq should be used only
for programs that must run in real mode Windows. Because real mode is
not available under Windows 3.1, most programs should be built using
the /GA switch (/GD for DLLs).
<P>
Note: /Gq is for use only when absolute compatibility is needed with
the Microsoft C version 6.0 compiler /GW switch. The code generated is
slightly less efficient than that generated by the C 7.0 /GW switch.
<P>
If you are using the /GA or /GD switch, and your code does not
explicitly have the __export keyword for the callback functions, you
may use the /GEf switch to cause all far functions (coded as __far) to
be treated as exports (as though __export had been specified). If
__export is explicitly coded, these functions do not need to be
declared in the EXPORTS section of the definition file. It is
recommended that __export be explicitly coded when new code is
written.
<P>
The /GEf switch causes all functions to be treated as __export if used
under medium or large memory model. In this case, the only way to
control exporting is to explicitly code __export and not use /GEf.
