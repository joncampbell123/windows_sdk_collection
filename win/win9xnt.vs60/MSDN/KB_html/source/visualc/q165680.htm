<P><h3>Do Not Install Visual C++ 5.0 Over an Installation of Visual C++ 4.x</h3>
 
<P>
Installing Visual C++ 5.0 on top of Visual C++ 4.x will render the 4.x
tools unusable. Install Visual C++ 5.0 into a directory separate from your
Visual C++ 4.x installation. Visual C++ 5.0 can co-exist with a 4.x
installation, as long as both versions reside in different directories.
<P>
Protected-Mode CD-ROM Driver Required Under Windows 95 for Visual C++
Installation
 
<P>
To install Visual C++ 5.0 under Windows 95, you must be running a protected-
mode CD-ROM driver. You can verify this by checking the Device Manager. If
you are currently using a real-mode CD-ROM driver, contact your CD-ROM
drive manufacturer for an updated driver for Windows 95 before installing
Visual C++ 5.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Use Knowledge Base Articles to Solve Setup and Operating Problems</h3>
 
<P>
You can use the Knowledge Base articles in the MSDN documentation to
resolve known installation and operating problems. Select the Search
command from the Help menu and search for error message or related keywords
to find a problem description and resolution.
<P>
Knowledge Base articles, which are written by Microsoft Technical Support
Engineers, are available by connecting to <B><A href="http://">http://</A></B> www.microsoft.com/kb/.
Choose Visual C++ in the Choose a Microsoft product or technology drop-down
list. Enter the article number in the Enter a Search Phrase text box, then
click Begin Search.
<P>
<P><h3>Applications Built with OLEAUT32.LIB Require AXDIST.EXE and/or NT SP5</h3>
 
<P>
Visual C++ 5.0 ships with the latest OLEAUT32.LIB from the ActiveX SDK
which exposes entry points into the OLEAUT32.DLL which are not present in
the OLEAUT32.DLL that ships with the original NT and Windows 95 operating
systems. If you build an OLE-enabled application or component with Visual
C++ 5.0, and link with OLEAUT32.DLL, you will need to install the newer
OLEAUT32.DLL via the AXDist.exe applet located in the
DevStudio\VC\Redist\AXRedist directory on the Visual C++ 5.0 CD-Rom.
<P>
If you are targeting Windows NT 3.51, you will need to ensure that NT
Service Pack 5 is installed on the target machine.
<P>
NOTE: The Vcread.htm file incorrectly refers to SP5a for Windows NT 3.51.
It should state SP5 as the preceding topic does. SP5 for Windows NT 3.51 is
located on CD two of the Microsoft Visual C++ Enterprise CD set, or in the
\Winnt351.qfe\SP5a directory on CD four of the Microsoft Visual Studio 97
Enterprise CD set.
<P>
<P><h3>DAO Setup Requires OLEAUT32.dll 2.20.4054 or Later</h3>
 
<P>
The redistributable DAO Setup program that ships with Visual C++ will not
run successfully unless OLEAUT32.dll build 2.20.4045 or later is installed
and registered on the target computer. The newer version of OLEAUT32.dll
must be copied to the target machine's SYSTEM directory, and registered
with REGSVR32.exe. An up-to-date version of OLEAUT32.dll can be found on
the first disc of Visual C++, in the DevStudioVC\Redist directory.
<P>
<P><h3>Viewing "ANSI Character Code Chart" in InfoView Requires an English System</h3>
 
<P>
The character codes displayed in the "ANSI Character Code Chart" topic will
only display correctly if viewed on English systems using an "ANSI-
compatible" codepage.
<P>
<P><h3>Accessing Online Help Brings Up MSN Dialog Box</h3>
 
<P>
When accessing online help you may get a dialog box asking about your dial-
up connection for your online service provider. This occurs because
Internet Explorer, which has an option to automatically connect to the
online service, is used to display the online documentation. The best way
around this is to choose Cancel when asked to connect. You can disable
automatic dialup.
<P>
To turn off the automatic dialup:

<OL><P><LI>Right-click Interne Explorer to get the Context menu. Click Properties.
</OL>2. In the Properties dialog box, click the Connection tab.
3. In the Dialing group, uncheck the "Connect to the Internet as needed".
<PRE>   This will turn off the Auto dialup.
</PRE></OL>4. Click Apply and OK to close the dialog box.
<P>
Special Instructions for Installing Visual C++ 5.0 on Far East
Operating Systems
 
<P>
The Visual C++ installation does not copy over the localized versions of
RICHED32.DLL, GAPI32.DLL, and HLP95EN.DLL on machines running a DBCS
enabled Operating System. These 3 files are required by some of the ActiveX
Controls installed by Visual C++.
<P>
If you install this version of Visual C++ on a Far East Operating System,
be sure to copy these 3 files from the directory on the Visual C++ CD
indicated below into your System directory:
<P>
<PRE>   Chinese (PRC)     DevStudio\VC\Redist\Ocx\chs

   Chinese (Taiwan)  DevStudio\VC\Redist\Ocx\cht

   Japanese          DevStudio\VC\Redist\Ocx\jpn

   Korean            DevStudio\VC\Redist\Ocx\kor

</PRE><h3>ODBC Setup.exe is Not in REDIST Directory</h3>
 
<P>
In ODBC 3.0 several of the ODBC Installer functions have been removed, and
others have been redesigned. Therefore this Setup program would not work
with ODBC 3.0.
<P>
The Installer API has been changed to make it more platform independent.
For example, functions in the Installer API (such as SQLInstallODBC) that
duplicated the work of the Windows SDK Setup program have been removed. In
general, it is now the responsibility of the Setup program to copy files
during installation.
<P>
For more information about creating setup programs that install ODBC 3.0
components and drivers, please refer to Part 3 in the ODBC 3.0 Programmers
Reference. To access the ODBC 3.0 Programmers' Reference, open ODBC.hlp
which can be found in DevStudio\SharedIDE\Help.
