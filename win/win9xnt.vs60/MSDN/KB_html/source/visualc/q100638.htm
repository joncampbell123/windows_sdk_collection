The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1 and
   4.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
At present, these hardware platforms support developing Win32-based
applications: Intel 386 or later, MIPS R4000, DEC Alpha, and the Power PC.
The text below deals with the issues involved with developing applications
for all of these platforms simultaneously.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Due to the disparate nature of these platforms, binary compatibility is not
a viable option. Therefore, Win32 provides source code compatibility. You
can create a version of your application for each CPU by recompiling the
source code.
<P>
However, Visual C++ 32-bit Edition does not support cross-compiling between
these platforms at this time. Therefore, to develop applications for each
hardware platform, you must compile the code with the tools available for
each platform, such as Visual C++ for Intel, Visual C++ for MIPS, and
Visual C++ for Alpha.
<P>
NOTE: Visual C++ versions 2.x and 4.0 does have a Macintosh add-on that can
be used to port Win32-based applications to a native Macintosh 68K
platform. It is a cross- development platform, meaning that the tools are
hosted on a Windows NT machine on the Intel platform and target the
Macintosh.
<P>
Be careful not to confuse source compatibility across hardware platforms
(Intel, MIPS, Alpha, Power PC) with binary compatibility across application
execution environments (Win16, Win32). We supports binary compatibility
between application execution environments on the same hardware platform,
through emulation. For example, a 16-bit Windows-based application
developed for Intel hardware can run without modification on an Intel
machine running Windows NT and, with the appropriate Win32s dynamic-link
libraries (DLLs) and virtual devices (VxDs), a Win32-based application
developed for Intel hardware can run without modification on an Intel
machine running 16-bit Windows 3.1.
