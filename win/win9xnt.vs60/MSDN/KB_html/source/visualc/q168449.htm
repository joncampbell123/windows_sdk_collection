The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.2, 4.2b, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Loading Visual C++ 5.0 on a system that has Visual C++ 4.x installed will
cause numerous DLLs, OCXs, and other components to be overwritten. One set
of components that is updated are the data-bound controls.

<UL><LI>DBGrid
<LI>DBListBox
<LI>DBComboBox
<LI>Remote Data Control
<P>
</UL>Although it is possible to load Visual C++ 4.x and 5.0 on the same system
in different directories, Visual C++ 4.x will have trouble displaying the
data-bound controls properties.
<P>
Displaying the "All" Tab on Database Controls such as Microsoft Data Combo
and Microsoft Masked Edit Box shows &lt;Property unknown&gt; after having
installed Visual C++ 5.0. Normally, you will see Datasource, field
properties, etc.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Visual C++ 5.0 installs upgrades of the data-bound controls that have the
same file names as the versions that ship with Visual C++ 4.x.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you want to work with Visual C++ 4.2, replace the appropriate controls
in your system32 from the version 4.2 redist\ocx directory (in this case,
MSMASK32.OCX DBLIST32.OCX).
<P>
The Property Dialog Headings for these controls have also changed to
Microsoft DBCombo, version 5.0 and Microsoft Masked Edit Box version 5,
rather than Microsoft DBCombo and Microsoft Masked Edit Box. Creating a new
project exhibits the same problem. This makes is somewhat difficult to use
these controls.
<P>
There are three controls that have the same name as the previous version
and therefore overwrite the version that works with version 4.2:

<UL><LI>DBGrid32.ocx
<LI>DBList32.ocx
<LI>MSMask32.ocx
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
It is not possible to work with version 5.0 data-bound controls in
Visual C++ 4.x or with version 4.x data-bound controls in Visual C++ 5.0.
The data-bound controls have been changed in these two versions.
<P>
It is highly recommended that you chose between versions 4.2 or 5.0 when
working with database applications that use the data-bound controls.
<P>
Although this is problem in the design interface, the newer 5.0 controls
can be used by older 4.2 applications at run-time.
