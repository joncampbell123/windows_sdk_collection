The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An attempt to run the Visual C++ Setup program across a network from a
disk drive located on another machine may fail and Setup may generate
the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Internal Error: File list initialization failed.
   Choose OK to terminate Setup.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Setup queries the operating system to determine the type of device
from which Setup is running. Setup uses the GetDriveType() function in
the Microsoft Windows-based application programming interface (API). This
function returns three possible values, as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   DRIVE_REMOVABLE: disk can be removed from the drive.
   DRIVE_FIXED: disk cannot be removed from drive.
   DRIVE_REMOTE: network drive.

</PRE>If the disk drive is shared over a network, Windows reports it as a
remote drive rather than a removable drive. When Setup runs from a
remote drive it attempts to perform a network installation instead of
a floppy disk installation.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This situation usually occurs when the target machine does not have a
disk drive of the correct size. In this case, the attempt to remedy
the situation by sharing a disk drive across a network is not
effective. There are two methods to address this situation: copy the
contents of all of the distribution disks to a network drive and
install from the network (see below for more details) or contact
Microsoft to obtain the correct size disks for the target system.
<P>
Visual C++ is distributed only on CD-ROM or on 3.5-inch high- density
floppy disks. 5.25-inch high-density disks are available from
Microsoft Customer Service. The Visual C++ package includes an order
form for 5.25-inch disks. In the United States, you can contact
Customer Service by phone at (800) 426-9600. Outside the United
States, contact the Microsoft subsidiary or distributor that serves
your country. To locate your distributor, go to the Microsoft Web site
<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm</A></B>
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you have a network server available, you can copy the files from
the Visual C++ distribution disks onto the server and run Setup from
the server. If the target machine has only low-density floppy disk
drives, this is the only method available to install Visual C++ on
that machine.
<P>
To run Setup from a network drive, perform the following three steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a directory on the server for Visual C++.

<P><LI>For each distribution disk, perform the following three steps:
<P>
   a. Create a subdirectory for the disk. Name the subdirectory DISK1,
<P><PRE>      DISK2, and so on as appropriate.
</PRE><P>
   b. Copy each disk into its corresponding subdirectory. Because some
<P><PRE>      of the distribution disks contain subdirectories, use a program
      like the MS-DOS XCOPY utility to copy the disks and create the
      required subdirectories.
</PRE><P>
   c. Use the following MS-DOS commands to copy each distribution disk
<P><PRE>      to the server (substitute the disk number for &lt;n&gt; in the code
      below):
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         md disk&lt;n&gt;
         cd disk&lt;n&gt;
         {insert disk &lt;n&gt; in an appropriate disk drive}
         xcopy a:*.* /s
         cd ..

</PRE><LI>The Professional Edition of Visual C++ is distributed on 20 3.5-
   inch high-density disks. When the software is installed on the
   server, the parent Visual C++ directory should contain twenty
   subdirectories.

</UL><OL><P><LI>On the target machine, start Windows and run Setup from the DISK1
   subdirectory on the server.
