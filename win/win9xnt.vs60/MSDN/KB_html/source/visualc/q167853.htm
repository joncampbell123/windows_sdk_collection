<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you build a MFC application for the Power Macintosh, the following
error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   LNK1104 Cannot Find mfc42pd.lib  (debug)

</PRE>-or-
<P>
<PRE>   LNK1104 Cannot Find mfc42p.lib   (release)

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs when you are compiling a Visual C++ Mac MFC application.
The headers from MFC 4.2 are being pulled in instead of the headers from
MFC 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Run the "Visual C++ Cross Development Setup" application found in the
"Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0" program group. If the application does not exist
in the program group, launch the executable Setupmfc.exe. Setupmfc.exe can
be found in the \msdev\bin directory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Visual C++ Mac is not a subscription-based product. Visual C++ (x86) is
subscription based though. The last release of Visual C++ Mac was Visual
C++ Mac 4.0, which worked with Visual C++ 4.0 and MFC 4.0. There was an
update for Visual C++ Mac (4.0b) that included new libraries and code
fragments for Windows Portability Library. It did not contain any new MFC
features.
<P>
Therefore, Visual C++ Mac 4.0 and 4.0b are supposed to work with MFC 4.0.
When a newer version of Visual C++ is installed (4.1 or 4.2), and Visual
C++ Mac is installed, the settings for MSDEV have to be changed using
Setupmfc.exe.
<P>
Setupmfc.exe changes the settings for MSDEV and also some registry
settings. It creates the directory \msdev\Mfc40 with 'include' and 'src'
directories that contain the include and src files from the Visual C++ 4.0
MFC directory. Then, it modifies the registry so that the header and source
file settings for the Power Mac and 68k Mac targets (found on the
Directories tab under Options on the Tools menu) point to those new
directories.
<P>
It is a common mistake to insert the VC Mac 4.0 CD or VC++ 4.2 (x86) when
running Setupmfc.exe. Please remember to insert the original VC 4.0 (x86)
CD.
<P>
In some rare cases, it may be necessary to use the windows headers from
Visual C++ 4.0 as well. This has to be done manually by copying the
\msdev\include directory from Visual C++ 4.0 to your \msdev and renaming it
(for example, include40). Then make the appropriate changes on the
Directories tab under Options on the Tools menu as well for the PowerMac or
68k Mac targets.
<P>
The reference to mfc42pd.lib and mfc42p.lib is found in
\msdev\mfc\include\afx.h. These two files do not exist.
