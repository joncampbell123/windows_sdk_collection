<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It may appear that the C compiler searches the INCLUDE list in the
wrong order. While the search order for a file enclosed in brackets
(&lt;&gt;) is simple, the order for a file enclosed in double quotation
marks ("") is different and more complicated.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: Using double quotation marks around a complete path
specification causes the standard directories to NOT be searched.
<P>
As documented in the "Include Files" section of the Visual C++, 16-bit
edition, "Microsoft C Language Reference," and "The #include Directive"
section of the Visual C++, 32-bit edition, "Preprocessor Reference," the
search order for a statement like "#include &lt;file.h&gt;" is as follows:
<P>

<OL><P><LI>Any directories specified using the /I switch on the CL command
   line, from left to right.

<P><LI>Directories specified in the include environment variable, again
   from left to right.

<P><LI>If the file is not found in either of these steps, the following error
   is issued:
<P>
<P><PRE>      fatal error C1015:  cannot open include file 'file.h'
</PRE><P>
   The Microsoft C/C++ compiler included with Visual C++, 32-bit edition,
   will issue the following error:
<P>
<P><PRE>      fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'file.h': No such file
</PRE>   or directory
<P>
</OL>For the following example, only the "\path" directory on the current
default drive is searched:
<P>
<PRE>   #include "\path\file.h"

</PRE></OL>The standard directories are not searched. However, the search order
for
<P>
<PRE>   #include "file.h"

</PRE>is similar to the search order for
<P>
<PRE>   #include &lt;file.h&gt;

</PRE>except that "parent directories" are searched before directories
specified by the /I switch and before directories specified in the
INCLUDE environment variable.
<P>
The parent directory is the directory that contains the source
containing the #include directive. If #include files are nested, then
the parent directories are searched in reverse order of the nesting:
first parents, then grandparents, and so on.
<P>
For example, if source file GRANDMA.C contains
<P>
<PRE>   #include &lt;parent.h&gt;

</PRE>and PARENT.H contains
<P>
<PRE>   #include "child.h"

</PRE>the search for CHILD.H will take place in the following order:

<OL><P><LI>The parent directory--in this case, the directory in which PARENT.H
   was previously found.

<P><LI>If CHILD.H is not there, the directory that contains GRANDMA.C
   will be searched next.

<P><LI>If CHILD.H is still not found, the directories (if any) specified
   in /I switches on the CL command line will be searched in left-to-
   right order.

<P><LI>If CHILD.H is still not found, the directories (if any) specified
   by the INCLUDE environment variable will be searched in left-to-
   right order.

<P><LI>If CHILD.H was not found in any of these places, the compiler will issue
   the following error:
<P>
<P><PRE>      fatal error C1015:  cannot open include file 'child.h'
</PRE><P>
   The Microsoft C/C++ compiler included with Visual C++, 32-bit edition,
   will issue the following error:
<P>
<P><PRE>      fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'child.h': No such file
</PRE>   or directory
<P></OL>
