The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The ClassWizard included with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, version 1.0
    - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, version 1.0
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Invoking ClassWizard produces the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Out of memory. Unable to complete command

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The project .CLW file (containing Class Wizard information) may have
grown larger than 65530 bytes. This can occur if a project contains
many classes that have been created using Class Wizard.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two possible workarounds for this problem:

<UL><LI>Divide your project into multiple projects [that is, one project
   that builds a static library (.LIB file) containing the code that
   most likely won't change, and the other project that builds the
   .EXE and includes the library in the linker options].
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Delete the .CLW file and reconstruct the .CLW using only the source
   files that are significant. To build a new .CLW file, follow these
   steps:
<P>
   1. Delete the existing .CLW file.
<P>
   2. Load the project.
<P>
   3. Go to App Studio.
<P>
   4. Invoke ClassWizard by typing CTRL+W or choosing the Class Wizard
<P><PRE>      button.
</PRE><P>
   5. A message box will be displayed asking to rebuild the .CLW. Choose
<P><PRE>      Yes.
</PRE><P>
   6. A dialog box be displayed similar to the one shown on page 133
<P><PRE>      of the Visual C++ for Windows App Studio "User's Guide." The
      dialog box permits the user to select the source files that will
      be scanned by Class Wizard. By default, the dialog box selects
      all files. To minimize the amount of ClassWizard information
      that will be placed in the .CLW file, select only the source
      files that contain the classes for which you think you will need
      ClassWizard.
</PRE><P>
</UL>NOTE: Be cautious when deleting a .CLW file! First, you may lose
message filter information for classes. Message filters determine what
messages are displayed in the Messages list box in ClassWizard. To
change the message filter for a class, choose the Class Info button
and then select the appropriate filter from the Message Filter combo
box.
<P>
Second, the project will lose information that maps resources created
in App Studio to classes created in ClassWizard. For example, when a
developer invokes Class Wizard when a dialog box resource is present in
App Studio, ClassWizard keeps information in the .CLW file that tells
it which class is associated with that resource (information for the
class is displayed). If the .CLW file is deleted, the user may be
asked to select a class for the resource. This can cause a problem.
Consider the following scenario:

<OL><P><LI>A dialog box is created in App Studio.
</OL>2. The .CLW file is deleted.
3. The developer reconstructs the .CLW file.
4. An attempt is made to create a class for the dialog box.
<P>
When an attempt is made to create a class for the dialog box, a list
box appears on the screen asking which class is to be associated with
the dialog box rather than the Add Class dialog box. Because no class
has yet been created by ClassWizard, the list box is inappropriate. To
resolve the problem, go to the Visual Workbench instead and invoke
ClassWizard. Select Add Class from the ClassWizard dialog box. You
will then be permitted to create a class for the dialog box, as well
as specify the ID of the dialog box resource that will be associated
with the class.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++
for Windows version 1.5.
