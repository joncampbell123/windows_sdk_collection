<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In a Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) Windows-based application, it
is often useful to be able to get a pointer to the currently active
document or view from anywhere in the program. For example, being able to
access the current document from a dialog box is sometimes useful. This
article discusses the simplest methods for doing so, using the
relationships between MFC objects, and basic MFC architecture.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
One of the cases where you might need a pointer to the currently active
view or document is in a modal or modeless dialog box. Generally, a dialog
box should be created by the view class, because the view is what deals
with the application's user interface.
<P>
Because the view class is creating the dialog box, it can pass a pointer to
itself, or the active document [obtained with the GetActiveDocument()
function] to the dialog box. This could be done through the dialog box's
constructor or some other member function. For modal dialog boxes, the view
could also put data from the dialog box into the document when DoModal()
returns.
<P>
These methods are generally preferable to relying on generic functions to
return pointers to the currently active view or document.
<P>
To allow you to get a pointer to the currently active document from
anywhere in the program, add a static member function to your CDocument
derived class as follows:
<P>
Edit the document's header file as follows to add a static member function,
GetDoc():
<P>
<PRE>   // Document header file
   class CMyDoc : public CDocument
   {
      ...
      public:
      static CMyDoc * GetDoc();
      ...
   };

</PRE>For a single document interface (SDI) application, add the following code
to your SDI document's implementation file for CMyDoc::GetDoc():
<P>
<PRE>   // SDI document implementation file
   CMyDoc * CMyDoc::GetDoc()
   {
      CFrameWnd * pFrame = (CFrameWnd *)(AfxGetApp()-&gt;m_pMainWnd);
      return (CMyDoc *) pFrame-&gt;GetActiveDocument();
   }

</PRE>For a multiple document interface (MDI) application, the CMyDoc::GetDoc()
code should be the following:
<P>
<PRE>   CMyDoc * CMyDoc::GetDoc()
   {
      CMDIChildWnd * pChild =
          ((CMDIFrameWnd*)(AfxGetApp()-&gt;m_pMainWnd))-&gt;MDIGetActive();

      if ( !pChild )
          return NULL;

      CDocument * pDoc = pChild-&gt;GetActiveDocument();

      if ( !pDoc )
         return NULL;

      // Fail if doc is of wrong kind
      if ( ! pDoc-&gt;IsKindOf( RUNTIME_CLASS(CMyDoc) ) )
         return NULL;

      return (CMyDoc *) pDoc;
   }

</PRE>To allow you to get a pointer to the currently active view from anywhere in
the program, add a static member function to your CView derived class as
follows:
<P>
Edit the view's header file as follows to add a static member function,
GetView():
<P>
<PRE>   // View header file
   class CMyView
   {
      ...
      public:
      static CMyView * GetView();
      ...
   };

</PRE>For an SDI application, add the following code to your SDI view's
implementation file for CMyView::GetView():
<P>
<PRE>   // View implementation file
   CMyView * CMyView::GetView()
   {
      CFrameWnd * pFrame = (CFrameWnd *)(AfxGetApp()-&gt;m_pMainWnd);

      CView * pView = pFrame-&gt;GetActiveView();

      if ( !pView )
         return NULL;

      // Fail if view is of wrong kind
      // (this could occur with splitter windows, or additional
      // views on a single document
      if ( ! pView-&gt;IsKindOf( RUNTIME_CLASS(CMyView) ) )
         return NULL;

      return (CMyView *) pView;
   }

</PRE>For an MDI application, the CMyView::GetView() code should be the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   // MDI view implementation file
   CMyView * CMyView::GetView()
   {
      CMDIChildWnd * pChild =
          ((CMDIFrameWnd*)(AfxGetApp()-&gt;m_pMainWnd))-&gt;MDIGetActive();

      if ( !pChild )
          return NULL;

      CView * pView = pChild-&gt;GetActiveView();

      if ( !pView )
         return NULL;

      // Fail if view is of wrong kind
      if ( ! pView-&gt;IsKindOf( RUNTIME_CLASS(CMyView) ) )
         return NULL;

      return (CMyView *) pView;
   }

</PRE>Now, from anywhere in your program, where the document or view header files
have been included, you can call:
<P>
<PRE>   CMyDoc::GetDoc();

</PRE>-or-
<P>
<PRE>   CMyView::GetView();

</PRE>to get a pointer to the currently active document or view, respectively.
These functions return NULL if there is no active document or view.
<P>
Note that a pointer to the application's CDocument or CView derived class
is returned, not just a generic CDocument or CView pointer. This allows you
to access members specific to your new class. The MDI versions of these
functions, and the SDI version of the GetView() function, will use run-time
type checking to verify that the document or view is of the correct class.
