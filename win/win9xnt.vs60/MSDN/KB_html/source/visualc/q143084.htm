The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) included with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Two errors can occur when using the MFC DAO database classes in a DLL.
Depending upon the context of how you use the MFC DAO classes in the DLL,
you can receive an assertion on line 36 of the Daocore.cpp or you may
receive an access violation.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The root of the problem exists in how MFC is terminating DAO. MFC calls
AfxDaoTerm from the exit instance of CWinApp. This is fine for applications
but isn't a good thing to do for DLLs because ExitInstance() is called from
the DLL_PROCCESS_DETACH case. Use of OLE and specifically DAO should be
avoided in the ExitInstance() of a DLL.
<P>
Another problem with the MFC DAO code is that it stores the pointer to the
database engine on a global scope so that if one regular DLL that links to
MFC dynamically closes and calls AfxDaoTerm, it closes the database engine
for any other DLLs which use DAO and link dynamically to MFC.
<P>
The line 36 assertion is caused by the fact that an exception gets thrown
in AfxDaoTerm when trying to call Release() on the database engine. The
exception prohibits the setting of m_pDAOEngine pointer back to NULL.
Again, this problem occurs because MFC incorrectly calls DAO in
ExitInstance() of a DLL.
<P>
Here is the code in AfxDaoTerm():
<P>
<PRE>   // Clean up engine object if necessary
      if (pDaoState-&gt;m_pDAODBEngine != NULL)
      {
            pDaoState-&gt;m_pDAODBEngine-&gt;Release();
            pDaoState-&gt;m_pDAODBEngine = NULL;
      }

</PRE>You can see that if an exception occurs in Release(), the m_pDAODBEngine
pointer is not set to NULL. Thus, the assert on line 36 of Daocore.cpp will
occur:
<P>
<PRE>   ASSERT(m_pDAODBEngine == NULL);

</PRE>An access violation can occur if you perform the following sequence:

<OL><P><LI>Dynamically load DLL1 and use MFC DAO classes.
</OL>2. Dynamically load DLL2 and use MFC DAO classes.
3. Close DAO objects and unload DLL1.
4. Do something with DAO in DLL2.
<P>
This occurs because the DLL1 has already shut down the DAO components.
<P>
There may be other scenarios that can cause other access violations to
occur. For example, do not create global MFC DAO objects within a DLL. The
resolution section below doesn't address this problem because it is
something that should not be done.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around the problems with DAO in a DLL, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Link all DLLs using the static version of MFC, except in the case of
   an .ocx that requires the shared MFC DLL.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Construct and Open a CDaoWorkspace object in the calling application
   so that the DAO engine is initialized and terminated in the
   application rather than in the any of your DLLs.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use the dbDAO C++ classes provided with the DAO SDK, which is installed
   from the Visual C++ CD-ROM compact disc.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ 4.1.
