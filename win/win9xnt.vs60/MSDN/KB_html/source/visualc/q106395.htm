The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Visual Workbench included with:
   Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.0 and 1.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Printing may appear to take longer than necessary when started from
the Visual Workbench, particularly if the printer is a dot matrix
printer or something similar. This is because printing is handled by
the Windows operating system. Windows follows the
"what-you-see-is-what-you-get" (WYSIWYG) method and prints the
document in a slower graphics mode to reproduce the displayed font,
rather than using the fast, default printer font.
<P>
In most cases, printing in the same font in which the source code is
displayed in the Visual Workbench is not necessary. Use of the default
font can therefore greatly speed up the printing process, and this can
be accomplished even though the printing is handled by Windows. A
printer driver called "Generic / Text Only," which is available on the
Windows installation disks, provides text-only output, and therefore
will use the default printer font. Note that this requires text-only
capability in the printer; for example, some PostScript printers do
not have this capability.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To install this driver:

<OL><P><LI>Select the Control Panel icon and choose Printers.

<P><LI>Choose Add.

<P><LI>Select the "Generic / Text Only" entry from near the top of the
   "List of Printers," then choose Install .
<P>
   Windows will prompt you for the Install floppy disk that contains
   the appropriate driver, TTY.DRV.

<P><LI>Insert the Install floppy disk and choose OK.
<P>
   Windows will decompress the driver file and copy it to your hard
   drive.

<P><LI>Choose Connect if you need to specify a different port for the
   printer.
<P>
</OL>When printing is required from the Visual Workbench, choose Print from
the File menu. The dialog box that appears contains a list box that
displays the available printers. Select the "Generic / Text Only"
printer and choose OK. Output from the printer will appear using the
faster, default printer font.
<P>
This printer driver work bests with a dot matrix printer; using it
with a laser printer may require modifying the page or printer setup
because of the laser printer's different page length. Also, there is
little benefit in using the default font with a laser printer, because
a laser printer can print quickly with any font.
<P>
If further assistance is needed, the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide"
provides information on the printer installation process.
