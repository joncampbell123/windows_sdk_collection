<UL><LI>The Microsoft C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE) included with:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
There are three types of data pointers in Microsoft C: near, far, and
huge. Near pointers represent offsets within DGROUP (the default data
segment) and are stored in 2 bytes. Far and huge pointers contain both
a segment address/selector and an offset, and therefore take 4 bytes.
However, the arithmetic done on far and huge pointers is different.
Therefore, huge pointers should be used for an item that will cross a
segment boundary.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Although far and huge pointers are identical in format, the algorithms
used to do addressing calculations involving these pointers are very
different. Far pointers are assumed to point to a data item that does
not cross a segment boundary (in other words, the size of the item
must be less than 64K). As a result, the compiler ignores the segment
part of the pointer in all calculations except for "equals" and "not
equals" tests. This gives a considerable savings in execution time
(more than twice as fast) for these operations. In fact, calculations
involving far pointers are almost as fast as calculations involving
near pointers.
<P>
Huge pointers may point to items that are larger than 64K. The
addressing arithmetic works on both the segment and the offset. Huge
pointer arithmetic is therefore considerably slower than far
arithmetic, but it has the advantage of working when the data item is
larger than 64K.
<P>
When compiling with the huge memory model (/AH), all pointers are huge
pointers. If there are only a few items that need huge pointers, it
would be better to use a large memory model and explicitly declare
those items huge; otherwise, there is a considerable performance hit.
Use one of the following methods to declare an array of 75,000 chars:

<OL><P><LI>Declare a huge pointer and allocate memory with halloc:
<P>
<PRE>   char _huge *array;
   array = (char _huge *) halloc( 75000L, sizeof( char ) );

</PRE><P><LI>Explicitly declare a huge array:
<P>
<PRE>   char _huge *array[75000L]

</PRE></OL>Note that a capital L is placed at the end of an integral constant to
indicate that it should be interpreted as a long int rather than an
int.
<P>
Huge pointer arithmetic is not supported in the small and medium model
run-time libraries. In the compact and large model libraries, only the
following functions support huge pointer arithmetic:
<P>
<PRE>   bsearch        _fmemchr           _fmemmove        lfind
   fread          _fmemcmp           _fmemset         lsearch
   fwrite         _fmemcpy           halloc           memccpy
   _fmemccpy      _fmemicmp          hfree            memchr

</PRE>NOTE: The count parameter of many of these functions is of type size_t,
which is an unsigned int (65535). Although these functions can accept huge
pointers to objects in which the area being copied from and to can span a
segment boundary, the function still only supports copying 64K worth of
data at a time.
