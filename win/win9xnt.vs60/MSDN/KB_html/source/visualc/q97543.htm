The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++ for MS-DOS, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The text below presents information in Part 7 of the README.WRI file
distributed with Microsoft Visual C++ version 1.0. Setup installs
README.WRI in the MSVC\HELP directory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Debugging Applications That Use Toolbars</h3>
 
<P>
Certain video drivers contain INT 3 instructions, which were used for
debugging purposes during the development of the driver but were not
removed from the retail version. When a debugger is not running, these
INT 3 instructions are ignored. When a debugger is running (including
the Visual Workbench's integrated debugger and CodeView for Windows),
an INT 3 instruction is interpreted as a breakpoint, causing program
execution to stop. INT 3 instructions also interfere with the MS-Test
application, which interprets an INT 3 instruction as a GP fault.
<P>
The drawing code in the toolbars provided with the Microsoft
Foundation Class Library may cause certain video drivers to execute an
INT 3 instruction. If you encounter this problem when debugging a
program written with the Microsoft Foundation Class Library, you can
safely ignore the interruption and continue executing your program, or
you can change the INT 3 into a NOP instruction from within the
debugger and then continue.
<P>
<P><h3>Converting from MFC 1.0 to MFC 2.0</h3>
 
<P>
When recompiling MFC 1.0 applications for MFC 2.0, makefile and source
modifications may be needed. These changes are discussed in Technical
Note #19 in the MFCNOTES.HLP file accessed through the MFC Tech Notes
Winhelp icon in the Microsoft Visual C++ program group.
<P>
<P><h3>Migrating the WEP of a DLL to Foundation Class Library Version 2.0</h3>
 
<P>
In version 2.0 of the Foundation Class Libraries, the ExitInstance()
member function of your WinApp-derived class will be called from a
_WEP function provided by the Foundation Class Libraries (which in
turn is called by the C++ run-time library when Windows calls the
DLL's WEP). If you implemented a DLL using version 1.0 of the
Foundation Class Libraries, you had to explicitly implement the _WEP
function. To migrate your DLL from version 1.0 to version 2.0, you
need to move your code from the old _WEP function to an override of
the CWinApp::ExitInstance() function, and remove the old _WEP.
<P>
<P><h3>Using VBX Custom Controls</h3>
 
<P>
A large number of Visual Basic version 1.0 VBX custom controls have
been tested and verified to work with App Studio and MFC 2.0, but the
VBX you are using may not be one of them, especially if it is one not
widely distributed.
<P>
Important: If you experience any of the problems identified below,
please contact the developer of the VBX control to obtain information
about a possible update of the control that has been verified to
function with App Studio and MFC 2.0. Microsoft is actively working
with VBX control vendors to ensure that VBX controls work successfully
with App Studio and MFC 2.0.
<P>
Possible symptoms of a control that does not work with App Studio and
MFC 2.0 are:

<UL><LI>repaint problems (not painting, or painting too much)

<LI>setting property values not reflected in the control

<LI>inability to resize the control

<LI>control does not reflect tab order/grouping property accurately

<LI>control does not function under Test Mode

<LI>control cannot be properly initialized if programmatically created
   because it assumes that it is being loaded from a form

<LI>Unrecoverable Application Error

<LI>General Protection Fault

<LI>debug kernel Fatal Exit
<P>
</UL><h3>Debugging Dialogs or Form Views That Contain VBX Controls</h3>
 
<P>
When using the Visual Workbench debugger, if you set a breakpoint in a
function that directly or indirectly creates a VBX control, you may
get a message box stating, "The program is stopped in the debugger."
If this happens, you must choose OK in the message box before the
debugger will set focus on the breakpoint in your sources. You can
continue debugging at this point.
<P>
This unexpected message box is displayed only when you use the Visual
Workbench debugger in soft mode. This does not happen when you use the
Visual Workbench debugger in hard mode or when you use CodeView for
Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>No Debug Support for Small or Compact Model MFC Applications</h3>
 
<P>
You cannot build small or compact model debug MFC applications. The
additional debug code exceeds the small and compact model limits of
64K code even for the a trivial MFC application. You can build small
or compact model release applications using the release versions of
the small or compact model libraries. If you wish to ship a small or
compact model MFC application, use medium or large model
(respectively) for debug builds and small or compact model for the
final release build.
<P>
<P><h3>Using ClassWizard on the CHKBOOK Sample Program</h3>
 
<P>
The CCheckView class has two message handlers: OnEditCommitCheck() and
OnAmountNumChange(). If you examine the class using ClassWizard and
highlight OnEditCommitCheck() in the Member Functions list box, no
entry is highlighted in either the Object IDs list box or the Messages
list box. This is because CCheckView is derived from CFormView, and
ClassWizard treats CFormView-derived classes as dialog classes rather
than as view classes. As a result, ClassWizard lists only the controls
in the associated dialog template and the notification messages that
those controls can generate. (For example, ClassWizard highlights the
notification message handled by OnAmountNumChange() and the ID of the
control that generates that message.) To see what message is
highlighted by OnEditCommitCheck(), use App Studio to open CHKBOOK.RC
and edit the IDR_CHECKFRAME menu resource. Then invoke ClassWizard to
examine CCheckView.
<P>
For more information on how ClassWizard interacts with
CFormView-derived classes, see the items on CFormView in ERRATA.WRI.
