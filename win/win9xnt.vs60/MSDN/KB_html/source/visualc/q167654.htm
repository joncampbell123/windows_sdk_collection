<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains a list of Frequently Asked Questions and their
answers. All questions concern Visual C++ 5.0. Issues relating to the
Enterprise Edition only are located at the bottom of the article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
1.Q. Where can I find a listing of new features in Visual C++ 5.0?
<P>
A. For a listing of new features in Visual C++, please refer to the "What's
New" sections for the appropriate Visual C++ product. In addition, an
extensive readme (VCREAD.HTM) comes with Visual C++ 5.0. This has a wealth
of information on subjects like ATL, Enterprise development, compiler
issues and more, that we were unable to include in the online
documentation. Like VCREAD, READMEDT.HTM and ENVIRON.HTM are readme files
concerning the visual database tools and IDE issues.
<P>
2.Q. Where can I find InfoViewer FAQ issues?
<P>
A. Please see the Visual Studio FAQ at www.microsoft.com/vstudio.
<P>
3.Q. Why do I have to use Microsoft's Internet Explorer (IE) v3.0 with
Visual C++ 5.0?
<P>
A. The InfoViewer, which displays the online documentation, uses the
Internet Explorer control that is part of Internet Explorer 3.0. While this
is required for the InfoViewer, it does not mean you have to use Internet
Explorer as your default browser.
<P>
4.Q. Why are the installed binaries in the \program files\devstudio\
sharedide different than those on the CD?
<P>
A. When Visual C++ is installed, several of the executables are "bound"
using imagehlp API's to decrease load time.
<P>
5.Q. The VCREAD.HTM file says that you should not install over Visual C++
4.x, and later that they can coexist. Please explain.
<P>
A. Installing Visual C++ 5.0 into the directory used by Visual C++ 4.x
(\MSDEV) can lead to unpredictable behavior. One reason for this is that
the directory structure for Visual C++ 5.0 has radically changed. Visual
C++ 5.0 does not replace any of Visual C++ 4.x's registry entries or
program groups. So, according to your desktop, Visual C++ 4.x appears to
still be installed. Therefore, it appears that you can run Visual C++ 4.x.
However, it will not succeed. Instead, you should install Visual C++ 5.0
into a separate directory structure to ensure a clean install. You do not
need to uninstall Visual C++ 4.x prior to installing Visual C++ 5.0 since
the two can co-exist. Please see VCREAD for more detailed information. One
additional caveat that is not in the readme is that Visual C++ 5.0 includes
some of the same controls that were included in Visual C++ 4.x. These will
be overwritten if you choose to install the controls. The affected controls
are: DBGrid32.OCX, DSList32.OCX, MSComm32.OCX, MCI32.OCX, MSMask23.OCX, and
PicClp32.OCX.
<P>
6.Q. Why do I get a missing export or ordinal 6451 in MFC42.DLL when I
start MSDEV.EXE for the first time?
<P>
A. This happens when you use the MFC42.DLL that shipped with Visual C++
4.2. If you have not rebooted since installing Visual C++ 5.0, rebooting
solves the problem. It is also possible that an installation program for
another product can overwrite this DLL.
<P>
7.Q. Attempting to use some tools from newly created project, may generate
the following error:
<P>
<PRE>      The specified path is invalid.

</PRE>A. This error message occurs because the project has not generated the path
information for the tools. Build the project to work around this. In some
cases, closing and reopening the workspace may work around the problem.
<P>
8.Q. Why doesn't anything happen when I try to profile my application from
within Visual C++?
<P>
A. To work around this problem, add an environment variable to your path
that includes c:\program files\devstudio\vc\bin, presuming Visual C++ is
installed on your C: drive and that you have selected the default
installation options.
<P>
On Windows NT:
<P>
<PRE>   1. In the Control Panel, select the System applet.
   2. From the Environment tab, enter PATH in the Variable field.
   3. In the Value field, enter c:\program files\devstudio\vc\bin.
   4. Click OK.

</PRE>The next time you start Visual C++, the profiler will work correctly.
<P>
On Windows 95:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Open the Autoexec.bat file with an editor.
   2. Add the following line, making sure to include the quotation marks:

      set PATH= c:\"program files"\devstudio\vc\bin

   3. The environment variable will take effect when you reboot your
      computer.

</PRE>9.Q. Why isn't the ODBC 3.0 Programmers Reference included in the online
documentation?
<P>
A. We provide up-to-date .HLP files for the ODBC Programmers Reference on
the CD in the \DevStudio\SharedIDE\Help directory (See VCREAD.HTM for more
information).
<P>
10.Q. What is MIDL error MIDL2039?
<P>
A. This is a new MIDL error. Previously, MIDL permitted the (erroneous) use
of invalid types in OLE automation (or dual) interfaces. The set of types
that can be passed through an automation interface is much more restricted
than the set that can be passed in an arbitrary COM interface.
<P>
If the rest of the interface isn't using OLE automation data types (for
Example, an ULONG is typically not an OLE automation data type), the
following two examples can cause this error:
<P>
<PRE>   [
   object,
   uuid(CE2EDE50-8E6A-11D0-8C74-00C04FE0DFDF),
   dual,     &lt;&lt; implicit oleautomation
   helpstring("ISome Interface"),
   pointer_default(unique)
   ]

</PRE>-or-
<P>
<PRE>   [
   object,
   uuid(CE2EDE50-8E6A-11D0-8C74-00C04FE0DFDF),
   oleautomation,
   helpstring("ISome Interface"),
   pointer_default(unique)
   ]

</PRE>11.Q. From the command line, I go to my projects directory and there is no
.MAK file for my project. Why?
<P>
A. .MAK files are no longer automatically generated. You can manually
export MAK files from the Export Makefile selection in the Project Menu. In
addition, MAK files can be automatically exported each time the
modifications are saved. To do so, from the Tools menu select Options. In
the Options dialog box, click the Build tab and select the "Export makefile
when saving project file" check box.
<P>
12.Q. Will there be a release of Visual C++ 5.0 that targets the Macintosh
platform?
<P>
A. At this time, a Macintosh Cross-Development Edition is not planned for
Visual C++ 5.0. The latest version of Visual C++ Cross-Development Edition
that targets the Macintosh platform is version 4.0b. For more information
on Visual C++ Cross-Development Edition for the Macintosh, please see the
product documentation on <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualc/">http://www.microsoft.com/visualc/.</A></B>
<P>
13.Q. While installing Visual C++ 5.0 in Windows NT 4.0, I get the
following message:
<P>
<PRE>      Setup detects that you are not a member of the Administrator group,
      which is required for installing ODBC, ActiveXRPC debugging, Internet
      Explorer, and Just-in-Time debugging. Continue ?, Yes ,No "

</PRE>Does this mean that I will not be able to use Visual C++ if I continue?
<P>
A. Visual C++ version 5.0 installation in the Windows NT 4.0 operating
system requires that the user account have administrative privileges. This
is necessary for installing Internet Explorer and the other components
mentioned in the message above. Visual C++ uses Internet Explorer to access
the online documentation. If you continue the installation, you will be
deprived from using the listed components. Also, you will not be able to
insert any third party ActiveX Controls included in the package in your
application.
<P>
14.Q. Why isn't the put_Font or putref_Font method called when an ActiveX
control's Font property is changed by the ActiveX Control Pad?
<P>
A. The put_Font or putref_Font method is called only when you completely
replace your control's Font object with a new one. When you change the font
in the ActiveX Control Pad, get_Font is called to get a pointer to the Font
object for the ActiveX Control Pad. Changes made by the Control Pad are
made directly to that object. The ActiveX Control Pad does not create a new
Font object and assign it to your Font property.
<P>
The following example demonstrates a case where the font property is
changed without calling the put_Font or putref_Font method:
<P>
<PRE>      object CLASSID="clsid:E882D673-878E-11D0-B00C-000000000000"
                     id="FontTest1"&gt;
        /object&gt;
      object CLASSID="clsid:E882D673-878E-11D0-B00C-000000000000"
                     id="FontTest2"&gt;
        /object&gt;

      SCRIPT LANGUAGE="VBScript"&gt;

      !--
      Sub Window_OnLoad
         FontTest1.Font.Name = "times new roman"
         FontTest1.Font.Size = 16
         FontTest2.Font = FontTest1.Font
      End Sub
   --&gt;
   /SCRIPT&gt;

</PRE>15.Q. How do I get the &lt;PARAM&gt; tag to work with an ATL control?
<P>
A. You need to support the IPropertyBag interface for the HTML &lt;PARAM&gt; tag
to work with your ATL control. An implementation of this interface is
supplied in the IPropertyBagImpl class that comes with ATL 2.1. The CIRC
sample demonstrates how to support IPersistPropertyBag and add your
properties to the property map.
<P>
16.Q. What are the reasons an ATL server might fail to register?
<P>
A. The following are the top three reasons an ATL server might fail to
register:
<P>
<PRE>   1. You built your project with _WIN32_WINNT=0x400 (the default), and
      you are not running the ATL server under Windows NT 4.0 or you do not
      have an up-to-date version of OLEAUT32.DLL. To solve this problem,
      run DUMPBIN /EXPORTS OLEAUT32.DLL and search for UnregisterTypelib.
      If it is not there, then your server cannot run. Remove this #define
      statement from STDAFX.H if you want to run the ATL server under
      Windows 95 or older versions of Windows NT. Note that the #define
      _WIN32_WINNT=0x400 could be anywhere, even in the Build settings.
      Alternatively, you can use LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress so that you
      can run optimally under both Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0. The
      OLEAUT32.DLL that ships with the Internet Explorer 3.x is up to date.

   2. You built your project as MinSize or Debug and ATL.DLL is not
      properly installed on the system. The correct version of ATL.DLL must
      be copied and registered by REGSVR32. There are Windows NT and
      Windows 95 versions of ATL.DLL. The Windows 95 version runs under
      Windows NT. However, since it does not use the UNICODE APIs, it is
      slightly less efficient. Unless you build your project as
      MinDependency, you need to install the correct version of ATL.DLL and
      run REGSVR32 on it before you install your server.

   3. You built your project as UNICODE and you cannot run it under
      Windows 95.

</PRE>Following are the steps to troubleshoot:
<P>
<PRE>   1. For a DLL server, run REGSVR32 in the debugger.
   2. Open the Project Settings dialog box and click the Debug tab.
   3. In the Executable for debug session text box, enter the full
      path to REGSVR32.EXE, such as C:\SHAREDIDE\BIN\REGSVR32.EXE.
   4. In the Program arguments text box, specify the full path to
      your DLL, such as C:\MYPROJECTS\FOO\DEBUG\FOO.DLL.
   5. Set a breakpoint at DllRegisterServer and start stepping.

</PRE>For an EXE server, run it in the debugger and specify /REGSVR as its
command-line argument.
<P>
17.Q. What causes linker error LNK2001 during Release MinDependency builds
of ATL projects?
<P>
A. This can happen when the C Run-Time (CRT) startup code is required for
some CRT functions. You can either remove all references to the CRT
functions or remove the _ATL_MIN_CRT preprocessor definition from your
compiler settings.
<P>
Some CRT functions can be used without the CRT startup code, for example,
functions with the mem prefix. The following require the CRT startup code:

<UL><LI>String comparison routines
<LI>Global objects with constructors
<LI>Exception handling
<P>
</UL>In Visual C++ 5.0, statically linking the startup code adds about 25K to
your image. If size is an issue for your control, you may be able to avoid
linking in the startup code.
<P>
To find out what is causing the problem:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Open the Project Settings dialog box, click the Link tab, and
      click Input in the Category box.
   2. Type LIBCMT.LIB in the Ignore libraries text box.
   3. Do a build.
   4. You get a list of unresolved externals. This list contains
      the CRT routines you are using. Look for the routines that you
      think may require the startup code.
   5. Turn on the /VERBOSE linker option.
   6. From the resulting linker output, you can find a list of routines
      that require the CRT startup code.
   7. If you need the startup code, remove the _ATL_MIN_CRT definition
      from the Project Settings. You can also dynamically link to CRT.
      This reduces your image size but requires MSVCRT.DLL.

</PRE>When you are building as MinSize, the default option is to statically link
to CRT and use _ATL_MIN_CRT. This gives a smaller image size than
dynamically linking to CRT, at least when the startup code is avoided and
the CRT APIs used by AppWizard are used.
<P>
18.Q. In ATL projects, how do I update the CLSID registry key under a
version-independent ProgID?
<P>
A. Creating the CLSID under a version-independent ProgID fails when you
pass this ProgID with only a CurVer key. To make it work, you need to add
the CLSID key under the version-independent ProgID.
<P>
If you have the following in your .RGS file:
<P>
<PRE>   TriBrowseObj.TriBrowseObj.1 = s 'TriBrowseObj Class'
   {
   CLSID = s '{3452E30B-8B87-11D0-A671-00A0C903977C}'
   }

   TriBrowseObj.TriBrowseObj = s 'TriBrowseObj Class'
   {
   CurVer = s 'TriBrowseObj.TriBrowseObj.1'
   }

</PRE>you must change it to:
<P>
<PRE>   TriBrowseObj.TriBrowseObj.1 = s 'TriBrowseObj Class'
   {
   CLSID = s '{3452E30B-8B87-11D0-A671-00A0C903977C}'
   }

   TriBrowseObj.TriBrowseObj = s 'TriBrowseObj Class'
   {
   CLSID = s '{3452E30B-8B87-11D0-A671-00A0C903977C}'
   CurVer = s 'TriBrowseObj.TriBrowseObj.1'
   }

</PRE>You also need to modify the wizard template (.RGS) in the following
directory:

<UL><LI>For Visual C++ 4.x: \MSDEV\TEMPLATE\ATL
<LI>For Visual C++ 5.0: \DEVSTUDIO\SHAREDIDE\TEMPLATE\ATL
<P>
</UL>Change the CONTROL.RGS file and any other .RGS files that are wrong. The
following statements:
<P>
<PRE>   [!ProgID] = s '[!TypeName]'
   {
   CLSID = s '{[!ObjectGUID]}'
   [!if=(InsertableEnabled, "TRUE")]
   [!endif]
   }

   [!VersionIndependentProgID] = s '[!TypeName]'
   {
   CurVer = s '[!ProgID]'
   }

</PRE>should be changed to:
<P>
<PRE>   [!ProgID] = s '[!TypeName]'
   {
   CLSID = s '{[!ObjectGUID]}'
   [!if=(InsertableEnabled, "TRUE")]
   'Insertable'
   [!endif]
   }

   [!VersionIndependentProgID] = s '[!TypeName]'
   {
   CLSID = s '{[!ObjectGUID]}'
   CurVer = s '[!ProgID]'
   }

</PRE>19.Q. What are the known problems with the ATL 2.0 Object Wizard?
<P>
A. The ATL 2.0 Object Wizard might not be present in the Component Gallery.
The ATL 2.0 Object Wizard is not installed by the main ATL 2.0 setup
program (ATLINST.EXE). It requires a separate setup program. You need to
download and run the ATL 2.0 Object Wizard Technology Preview (OBJINST.EXE)
from the ATL Web page. There is a separate ZIP file for Windows NT 3.51.
<P>
The ATL 2.0 Object Wizard may crash if an older version of OLEAUT32.DLL is
installed on the system. Make sure the version of OLEAUT32.DLL is at least
2.20.4049. The latest version is available for download at the Internet
Explorer 3.x web site.

<PRE>20. Q. Can I use a scripting language other than VBScript for macros?

</PRE>A. No, VBScript is the only scripting language Developer Studio supports
for macro recording and editing.

<PRE>21. Q. How can I debug a VBScript macro?

</PRE>A. You can use the PrintToOutputWindow method and the MsgBox command to
display debugging messages while the macro is running. Currently, macros
cannot be debugged using the Developer Studio debugger.

<PRE>22. Q. Can a macro handle a Developer Studio event?

</PRE>A. Yes, you just need to create a VBScript procedure with the name of the
object and event you want to handle. Refer to the Events section of the
Developer Studio Objects Reference for the correct syntax for each event.
As an example, if you wanted to handle the WindowActivate event that occurs
when a window is activated, your procedure would look similar to the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   sub Application_WindowActivate(theWindow)
      ' Insert code to handle the event here
   end sub

23. Q. How can I turn off VBScript error dialogs, so my macro can run
</PRE>without user intervention even if it encounters errors?
<P>
A. You can use the VBScript "On Error Resume Next" statement. Put this
statement on the line preceding any statements where an error may occur. An
example of this is before a call to the Documents.Open method where the
file you are attempting to open may not exist. If you put in the On Error
statement, and the file cannot be found, no error dialog will be displayed,
and the macro will continue running.

<PRE>24. Q. Is it possible to control docking windows like Project, Watch,
</PRE>Output through the object model?
<P>
A. No, these windows are not available in the Windows collection. However,
you can display messages in the Output window with the PrintToOutputWindow
method.

<PRE>25. Q. I see that there is a DevStudio Add-in Wizard and it produces a
</PRE>Visual C++ project. Can add-ins be developed with other programming
languages?
<P>
A. Yes, add-ins can be created in any language that supports exposing COM
interfaces, including languages other than Visual C++, like Visual Basic,
and Visual J++. To find out more about developing add-ins, and for sample
add-ins, refer to the Developer Studio Add-ins documentation.

<PRE>26. Q. Where can I get more answers to Developer Studio Automation
</PRE>questions?
<P>
A. Refer to the "How Do I ..." and "Frequently Asked Questions" sections of
the "Automating Tasks in Developer Studio" section of the User's Guide.
<P>
<P><h3>Visual C++ Enterprise Edition FAQ</h3>
 
<P>
1.Q. Can I use the Microsoft Visual Database Tools with any ODBC
datasource?
<P>
A. Yes, with varying degrees of functionality.

<UL><LI>Any ODBC datasource -- open and edit tables, create and
   execute queries
<LI>SQL Server 6.0 and Oracle 7.2 or 7.3 -- open and edit tables,
   create and execute queries, edit stored procedures and triggers
<LI>SQL Server 6.5 -- open and edit tables, create and execute queries,
   edit stored procedures and triggers, debug stored procedures and
   triggers, design databases
<P>
</UL>2.Q. Can I debug Oracle databases?
<P>
A. No, this would require changes to the Oracle Database Server. SQL
Debugging works only with SQL Server 6.5 on Intel platforms.
<P>
3.Q. Can I debug with Visual C++ Enterprise Edition 4.2 and Visual C++
Enterprise Edition 5.0 at the same time?
<P>
A. Yes, Visual C++ Enterprise Edition 5.0 SQL Debugging was designed to co-
exist with Visual C++ Enterprise Edition 4.2 SQL Debugging.
<P>
4.Q. Why does Automation manager start up when I use SQL Debugging, but not
shut down when I close Visual C++?
<P>
A. Automation manager is started automatically by Visual C++ when it is
first needed. Visual C++ does not shut it down because Automation Manager
doesn't provide an API to determine if other applications are using it. You
can safely shut it down when it displays that no connections are in use.
<P>
5.Q. How do I start SQL debugging in Visual C++ Enterprise Edition?
<P>
A. Please refer to the Hello World sample in the Visual C++ Enterprise
Edition 5.0 documentation.
<P>
6.Q. What software do I need installed to start SQL Debugging?
<P>
A. Client Side:

<UL><LI>Visual C++ Enterprise Edition 5.0
<LI>Win95 or NT 4.0
<P>
</UL>Server Side:

<UL><LI>Visual C++ Enterprise Edition 5.0 server side components from
   Visual C++ Enterprise Edition Server setup found on the second
   Visual C++ Enterprise Edition CD
<LI>SQL Server 6.5 and Service Pack 2 found on the second Visual C++
   Enterprise Edition CD
<LI>Windows NT 4.0 or Windows NT 3.51 + Service Pack 5.0a, SP5 found
   on the second Visual C++ Enterprise Edition CD
<P>
</UL>NOTE: You can install everything on one machine and do "local debugging,"
or you can install SQL Server on a separate machine and do "remote
debugging."
