<P>
A TreeView control is one capable of displaying items in a tree-like
hierarchical fashion. The control supports drag-and-drop. When an item is
dragged to the top or bottom of the control, the control does not
automatically scroll vertically.
<P>
Treescrl.exe shows how to add scrolling functionality to a tree control
during drag-and-drop.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
TREESCRL uses the CTreeView view class that encapsulates the functionality
of a view and a tree control. The sample's drag-and-drop functionality is
similar to the one demonstrated in CMNCTRLS, a sample shipped with the
Visual C++ product. When TREESCRL is built and run, an SDI window with a
CTreeView comes up. When you grab a tree control item (parent or child),
and drag it above/below the top/bottom of the view window, the tree control
starts scrolling upward/downward.
<P>
The idea behind TREESCRL is to install a timer when a drag-and-drop
operation starts. In the handler for the WM_TIMER message, it is first
determined if scrolling is needed. If it is, then the appropriate scroll
message is sent to the control. When the drag-and-drop operation
terminates, the timer is killed. The sample shows how to draw the drag
image and how to select the drop site during the dragging phase.
<P>
The tree control can scroll in different modes. During the drag phase, when
the mouse cursor is close to the top or the bottom border of the view,
scrolling is slow. The control scrolls at this slow speed when the
horizontal distance between the mouse and the corresponding view border
(top/bottom) is less than the width of a horizontal scrollbar. Scrolling
speeds up when the mouse is taken further away from either border.
<P>
SLOWSCROLL_FREQUENCY is a macro symbol in the view's .cpp file. This symbol
determines the relative speeds of normal and slow scrolling. Normal
scrolling occurs approximately every 75 milliseconds (the frequency of the
timer). In the sample, SLOWSCROLL_FREQUENCY is defined to be three (3),
which means slow scrolling is three times slower than normal scrolling. To
change the slow scrolling speed, modify this value to a positive integer.
