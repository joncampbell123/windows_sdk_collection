<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) included with:
   Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 2.1, 2.2, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A multi-threaded application that uses MFC's socket classes encounters a
message box or debug output line that contains an error message similar to
the following:
<P>
For Visual C++ 2.x:
<P>
<PRE>   Assertion failed - &lt;app name&gt;:File sockcore.cpp, Line 837

</PRE>For Visual C++ 4.0:
<P>
<PRE>   Assertion failed - &lt;app name&gt;:File sockcore.cpp, Line 1041

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Most frequently, this problem is due to the sharing of CSocket objects
between multiple threads.
<P>
A CSocket object should be used only in the context of a single thread
because the SOCKET handle encapsulated by a CAsyncSocket object is stored
in a per-thread handle map. (CSocket is derived from CAsyncSocket.) Other
information is stored on a per-thread basis, including a hidden
notification window that MFC uses for socket notifications.
<P>
The assertion failure line, which can be found in Sockcore.cpp in the
\Msvc20\Mfc\Src directory, is:
<P>
<PRE>   ASSERT(pThreadState-&gt;m_hSocketWindow != NULL);

</PRE>This assertion failure occurs because the CSocket object was either created
or accepted in the context of another thread. The socket notification
window was created in a different thread, and the m_hSocketWindow for the
current thread is NULL, thus the assertion failure.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
As already mentioned, a CAsyncSocket object should be used only in the
context of a single thread. If you need to switch the thread that is
accessing a SOCKET connection with another thread, then you should use a
separate CAsyncSocket object in each thread, and use the Detach and Attach
functions to attach the CAsyncSocket object to the SOCKET handle in the
thread that is about to use the socket. Use this sequence:

<OL><P><LI>Use Detach() to detach the CAsyncSocket object from the SOCKET handle in
   the thread that is currently using the CAsyncSocket object.

<P><LI>Use Attach() to attach a different CAsyncSocket object to the SOCKET
   handle while in the context of the MFC UI thread in which you wish to
   begin accessing the SOCKET connection.
<P>
</OL>The code shown in the "Code Sample" section of this article shows how to
handle the moment when a listening socket accepts a connection request and
then begins a new thread to handle the new connection.
<P>
NOTE: One concern often arises that socket notification messages might be
lost between the time the call to Detach() is made and the subsequent call
to Attach() is made. This is not a concern because of the way socket
notifications are handled. The implementation of CAsyncSocket::Attach()
makes a call to WSAAsyncSelect to enable notifications. As mentioned in the
documentation for WSAAsyncSelect, if any socket noficiations were already
pending for the SOCKET, they will be re-posted.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To Accept a socket in the context of one thread and then begin using it in
the context of another thread, you need to be sure to detach the
CAsyncSocket object in the first thread and attach a different CAsyncSocket
object in the second thread. The following code snippet shows how to do it.
<P>
<P><h3>Code Sample</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>// ...
</PRE></OL>class CSockThread : public CWinThread
{
<PRE>// ... Other function and member declarations
</PRE>protected:
<PRE>  CSocket m_sConnected;
</PRE>};
<P>
SOCKET hConnected;
<P>
BOOL CSockThread::InitInstance()
{
<PRE>  // Attach the socket object to the socket handle
  // in the context of this thread.
  //
  m_sConnected.Attach(hConnected);

  return TRUE;
</PRE>}
<P>
<PRE>// This listening socket has been constructed
// in the primary thread.
//
void CListeningSocket::OnAccept(int nErrorCode)
</PRE>{
<PRE>  // This CSocket object is used just temporarily
  // to Accept the incoming connection.
  //
  CSocket sConnected;
  Accept(sConnected);

  // Detach the newly accepted socket and save
  // the SOCKET handle
  hConnected = sConnected.Detach();

  // After Detaching it, it should no longer be
  // used in the context of this thread

  // Start the other thread
  AfxBeginThread(RUNTIME_CLASS(CSockThread));
</PRE>}

<P>
MFC Technical Note #2 - Although this technical note does not directly
address the CAsyncSocket class, it does discuss the mapping of handles to
objects. The relationship between a SOCKET handle and a CAsyncSocket object
is maintained in much the same way.
