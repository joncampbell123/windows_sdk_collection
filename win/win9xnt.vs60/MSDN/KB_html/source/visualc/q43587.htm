The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The C Run-time (CRT), included with:

<P><PRE>    - Microsoft C for MS-DOS, versions 5.1, 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0ax

<P>
The following are possible reasons that _setvideomode() might fail
when attempting to set a video mode:

<UL><LI>Some of the older IBM EGA (enhanced graphics adapter) cards only
   have 64K of video memory. As such, they cannot display the
   640 x 350, 16 (_ERES16COLOR) color EGA mode. However,
   lower resolution modes may work correctly because they don't
   require that much memory.

<LI>There are EGA cards that have DIP switch settings to set the card
   into high or low resolution modes. Some BIOS ignore these DIP
   switches and set the mode to high resolution. However, the
   _setvideomode() function does its own checking and may honor the
   DIP switch settings depending on the particular card. Setting the
   DIP switches properly for the high resolution modes should resolve
   the problem.

<LI>The video card may not support the requested mode. If the card does
   not support the mode, then _setvideomode() cannot set it into that
   mode.

<LI>Many VGA cards have nonstandard extended modes that are unique to
   those cards. _setvideomode() supports only standard video modes,
   and thus does not recognize the extended modes.

<LI>In C/C++ versions 7.0 and later some high resolution VGA modes are
   supported, but only if the correct VESA driver is loaded. This
   driver is a TSR program that must be loaded from the MS-DOS prompt
   before the program that sets the video mode is run.
