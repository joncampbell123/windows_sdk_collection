The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE) included with:
   - Microsoft C/C++ for MS-DOS, version 7.0
   - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.51, 1.52
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 4.0, 5.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
With both C and C++, the return statement terminates the function currently
executing and returns control back to its caller. However, the C and C++
languages differ slightly in their requirement that all paths of control
through a function return a value of the correct type.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The return statement has the form:
<P>
<PRE>   return [expression];

</PRE>The expression portion of the statement is optional. If an expression
is not specified, the return statement becomes equivalent to:
<P>
<PRE>   return void;

</PRE>Also, reaching the } (right curly brace) that terminates a function is
equivalent to executing a return statement without an expression.
<P>
The C++ language requires that all possible control paths through a
function return a value that is the same type as the return type specified
by the function prototype. If this is not the case, a fatal error is
generated by the compiler. The C language is not as strict in this
requirement. In C, if a control path ends in a return statement that
returns a value that is of a different type than that specified in the
function prototype, a warning may be generated but compilation will
continue.
<P>
Section r.6.6.3 of the C++ reference manual provided as a subsection of the
second edition of "The C++ Programming Language" by Bjarne Stroustrup
states:
<P>
<PRE>   A return statement without an expression can be used only in
   functions that do not return a value, that is, a function with the
   return value type void, a constructor, or a destructor. A return
   statement with an expression can be used only in functions
   returning a value; the value of the expression is returned to the
   caller of the function. ... Flowing off the end of a function is
   equivalent to a return with no value; this is illegal in a value-
   returning function.

</PRE>However, Section 3.6.6.4 of the ANSI specification for the C programming
language states the following:
<P>
<PRE>   If a return statement without an expression is executed, and the
   value of the function call is used by the caller, the behavior is
   undefined.

</PRE>If the sample code given below is compiled as a C++ file (.CPP), the
following error is generated by the compiler:
<P>
<PRE>   error C2202: 'Func' : not all control paths return a value

</PRE>However, if the same code is compiled as a C file (.C), compilation
completes without any warnings or errors.
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Code</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   /* Compile options needed: /c /W4
   */

   int Func ( int );

   int Func ( int nParam )
   {
        if ( nParam )
             return 1;
        else
             ;
   }

</PRE>The C++ compiler generates the C2202 error because it is possible for the
execution path of the function Func to flow off the end of the function if
nParam is equal to 0 (zero). Because encountering the } is equivalent to a
return statement with no expression, or a return type of void, the compiler
generates the error because this type does not match the return type of int
specified in the function prototype.
<P>
However, the C compiler sees that there is a return statement present that
does return the correct type. Because of this, the compiler does not issue
a warning. If no return statement is present at all, the C compiler
generates the warning:
<P>
<PRE>   warning C4035: 'Func' : no return value

</PRE>Compilation completes but any function that relies on the return value from
the function Func will be reading possibly invalid data.
<P>
With Microsoft C++, the only exception to the requirement that every
execution path in a C++ file return a value of the correct type is the
main() function.
<P>
If the sample code given below is compiled as a C++ file (.CPP), the
following warning is generated by the compiler:
<P>
<PRE>   warning C4508: 'main' : function should return a value; 'void'
                           return type assumed

</PRE>If the same code is compiled as a C file (.C), the following warning is
generated:
<P>
<PRE>   warning C4035: 'main' : no return value

</PRE>In both cases, compilation will complete.
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Code</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   /* Compile options needed: /c /W3
   */

   int main ( void );

   int main ( void )
   {
   }
</PRE>
