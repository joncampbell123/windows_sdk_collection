The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 5.0
   for the following platform:
   - Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Developer Studio does not detect changes to project files located on remote
computers when those project files are modified by an external source on a
remote computer. This occurs when Developer Studio is running on Windows
95. It may also occur on Windows NT when the remote files are on network
servers that are not running Windows.
<P>
There are two ways this problem manifests:

<OL><P><LI>If a remote file is open in Developer Studio and is modified by an
   external source, Developer Studio should notify the user that the file
   has been changed outside of the source editor and prompt the user to
   reload the file. However, there is no notification.

<P><LI>If a remote file is modified by an external source on a remote computer
   and a build is launched, Developer Studio does not detect it. It will
   not recompile the file or do whatever build step is necessary to rebuild
   files that are dependent on the remote file.
<P>
</OL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The problem occurs on networked systems that do not support the file change
notification functions defined in the Win32 API.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around problem 1, you need to reload the file manually.
<P>
To work around problem 2, you need to do a Rebuild All of the project,
rather than a Build.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
