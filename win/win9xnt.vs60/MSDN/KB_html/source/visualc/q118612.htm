<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you store an object in an archive by calling Serialize() directly, the
schema number for the object is not stored. As a result, if an older
version of an object with an older schema number is read using a later
version of the object, a CArchiveExeception is not produced. Instead, the
object reads the data that was written in the older format, using code that
reads the newer format; this often fails, causing the application to crash.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
MFC objects that use the DECLARE_SERIAL and IMPLEMENT_SERIAL macros have
schema numbers that indicate the "version" of the object. An MFC archive
maintains a list of objects and their schema numbers. When an object is
stored by means of the insertion operator (&lt;&lt;) or the WriteObject()
function, the schema number is also stored. Then, when the object is
retrieved using the extraction operator (&gt;&gt;) or the ReadObject() function,
the schema number from the archive is compared with the schema number of
the object in the application. If they are different, a CArchiveException
is produced.
<P>
When an object is stored by calling the Serialize() function of the object
directly, the schema number is not stored. When an older version of an
object is read back into the archive, Serialize() simply attempts to read
the data from the archive using the newer code for the object. If the data
format of the object has changed, the object is filled with bad data and
most likely causes the application to crash.
<P>
One way to avoid this problem is to use the insertion and extraction
operators, or ReadObject() and WriteObject(), whenever you serialize an
object. However, there are cases where you cannot do this and need to call
Serialize() directly. When you archive an object using the insertion and
extraction operators, or ReadObject() and WriteObject(), MFC dynamically
creates the object when it is loaded. If the memory for your object is
already allocated when you are ready to load the object, you will not want
MFC to create a new object, so you need to call Serialize() directly.
<P>
If you need to store an object by calling Serialize() directly, then you
may want to have your object contain its own version number in its
Serialize() function. While you are loading the object, check this number
to verify that the versions are the same.
