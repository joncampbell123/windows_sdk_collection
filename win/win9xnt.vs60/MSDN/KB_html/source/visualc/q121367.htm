<LI>Arrays Expanded Incorrectly and Values Displayed Are Wrong

<LI>Watch on Struct Member Gives CXX0030 If Offset &gt;= 32K (C++ only)
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Watch on Global Const Variable Gives CXX0030 or "Cannot watch variable"</h3>
 
<P>
When debugging a C++ program, watching a global const variable in the Watch
window of Codeview or the Watch window of Visual Workbench IDE Debugger
yields the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   CXX0030: Error: expression cannot be evaluated

</PRE>Using the QuickWatch tool button in Visual Workbench IDE Debugger gives a
dialog box that says:
<P>
<PRE>    Cannot watch 'variable'.

</PRE>This is by design but is under review for future releases of Microsoft
debug products. In Microsoft C++, storage of global constants is optimized
for the purpose of saving space, so no debugging information is generated.
<P>
For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../visualc/q115347.htm">Q115347</A></B>
   TITLE     : PRB: Debugger Cannot Watch Global Constants in C++ Programs

</PRE><h3>Watch on Base Class Member Gives CXX0030 or -??? * = {...}</h3>
 
<P>
An attempt to place a watch on a base class member variable within a
derived class may fail. Microsoft Codeview for MS-DOS, Codeview for
Windows, and the Visual Workbench IDE debugger may display one of the
following messages in the Watch or Locals window:
<P>
<PRE>   CXX0030: Error: expression cannot be evaluated

      -or-

   -??? * = {...}  which expands into the CXX0030 message

      -or-

   Just blank lines

</PRE>If you get these error messages, add a default constructor for the base
class. For information on this problem, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../visualc/q102212.htm">Q102212</A></B>
   TITLE     : BUG: Visual C++ Debugger Unable to Watch Base Class Members

</PRE>IMPORTANT NOTE: If you get blank lines when expanding a member variable of
a base class within a derived class, put a watch (or a Quick Watch) on the
entire derived class object. Then expand it to see the base class members.
This is often the case with base class member variables that are CStrings,
and occurs even when there is a default constructor.
<P>
<P><h3>CV1255 or "Unable to expand expression"</h3>
 
<P>
If forward class references are added to STDAFX.H and a project is compiled
with /Zi /Yu"stdafx.h", attempts to expand objects (of the type forward
referenced in STDAFX.H) in the locals or watch window do nothing. Instead,
the status bar states "Unable to expand expression" in 32-bit Visual C++
or "CV1255:Error: no data members" in 16-bit Visual C++.
<P>
If the forward references are removed from STDAFX.H, the objects can be
expanded. The problem can also be corrected by rebuilding the project using
either /YX or /Yc /Yd. In spite of the fact that the manuals state that /Yd
is obsolete when used with /Zi, this is actually not the case.
<P>

Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : BUG: CXX0033 Error in OMF Type from Forward Class
               Declaration

</PRE><h3>Watch on Structure Data Member Produces Incorrect Result</h3>
 
<P>
Setting a watch on a data member of a structure whose tag name is the same
as the struct variable name produces an incorrect result. This problem
occurs with C++ programs in the Visual Workbench IDE Debugger for Windows,
Codeview for Windows, and Codeview for MS-DOS. It also occurs with C
programs in the Visual Workbench Debugger for Windows NT and Codeview for
Win32s.
<P>
For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../visualc/q106394.htm">Q106394</A></B>
   TITLE     : BUG: Struct Data Member Incorrectly Displayed in Watch
               Window

</PRE><h3>Can't View Data When Watching or Quick Watching a Static Data Variable</h3>
 
<P>
When trying to watch or quick watch a static data variable in the context
of a static member function, or a static data member in a class, you may
not be able to view the data. If this is the case, you can refer to the
static data by prefixing it with the class name (for example,
CLASS::staticdata).
<P>
When trying to watch or quick watch a DLL exported static data member from
the debug session of the .EXE, you may not be able to view the data. This
is due to a bug in the debugger. The only workaround is to watch the data
member in the DLL debug session using the syntax suggested above.
<P>
<P><h3>Expansion of *Reference* to an Object May Consist of Only a Blank Line</h3>
 
<P>
When trying to expand a reference to an object in the Watch or Locals
window, the expansion may consist of only a blank line. This is due to a
bug in both CodeView and the Visual C++ IDE debugger (16-bit version only).
To work around the problem, cast the reference (in the watch window) as a
pointer to the class. For example, if you are trying to expand a reference
defined as "CRect &amp;rect," in the watch window, type "(CRect*)rect" (without
the quotation marks). Then expand it.
<P>
<P><h3>CV1255 When Trying to Watch Elements Of a Structure (MASM 6.10a)</h3>
 
<P>
Using MASM version 6.10a, if you create a program with a structure and use
the OPTION OLDSTRUCTS directive, you may get the error: CV1255 when trying
to watch elements of the structure. There is no workaround for this version
other than not using the OLDSTRUCTS option.
<P>
<P><h3>Array Expanded Incorrectly and Values Displayed Are Wrong</h3>
 
<P>
In C++ source files, passing an array as an argument to a function and then
trying to watch that array in the function causes CodeView and the Visual
WorkBench Debugger (16-bit) to expand the array incorrectly.
<P>
To work around the problem, declare the function argument as a pointer
rather than an array. For example, change a declaration which uses array
syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   void Function( int Array[5] )

</PRE>to a declaration which uses pointer syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   void Function( int * Array )

</PRE>For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../visualc/q112984.htm">Q112984</A></B>
   TITLE     : BUG: Debugger Expands Arrays Passed to Functions Incorrectly

</PRE><h3>Watch on Struct Member Gives CXX0030 If Offset &gt;= 32K (C++ only)</h3>
 
<P>
If a C++ application has a global struct containing member arrays that
exceed 32K total, expanding a member of the struct in the watch window will
give CXX0030 if the starting address of the member is over 0x7FFF from the
beginning of the struct. This is a bug in Visual C++ version 1.5x (16-bit).
<P>
The following code reproduces the problem:
<P>
<PRE>   // struc32k.CPP &lt;- MUST use C++ compiler
   struct test
   {
     char a[16384];
     char b[16384];     // if changed to b[16383],
     char c[10000];     // expanding c works correctly
   } teststruct;

   void main( void )
   {
    teststruct.c[0] = 'A';   // break here, set watch on teststruct,
                             // expand c
   }

</PRE>NOTE: There are no problems if this is a .C file.
