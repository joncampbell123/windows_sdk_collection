The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) version 3.0, included with
   Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version 2.0 4.0 4.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
While the Microsoft Foundations Classes versions 3.0 and later that ship
with Visual C++ versions 2.0 and later do support multiple threads, only
one external thread may be attached to a _USRDLL.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
_USRDLLs are MFC DLLs that are built as stand-alone DLLs. They can be used
with non-MFC applications. They are not closely tied to the application
that calls them and contain their own CWinApp derived class.
<P>
During the initialization of a _USRDLL, MFC allocates per-thread local data
using Thread Local Storage (TLS). Because this is done only during the
DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, only data for the attaching thread is allocated. MFC
_USRDLLs do not handle the DLL_THREAD_ATTACH case where additional threads
are created, or existing threads other than the one that originally
attached to the DLL.
<P>
Because most MFC 3.0 objects end up using TLS, accessing most MFC objects
from a secondary thread created outside the _USRDLL will cause access
violations. This is because each thread that uses MFC must be started with
AfxBeginThread so that this TLS data can be initialized.
<P>
This is a change from MFC version 2.0 that shipped with Visual C++ version
1.0 for Windows NT, where no TLS data was used by MFC. It was possible in
MFC version 2.0 to access _USRDLLs with multiple threads, as long as only
one thread accessed the DLL at a time. (This could be accomplished by using
EnterCriticalSection() or a semaphore.)
<P>
It is still possible to access the _USRDLL from multiple threads created in
the application if only one thread accesses the _USRDLL at a time and each
thread loads and unloads the _USRDLL. TLS data will be created for the
current thread each time the DLL is loaded.
<P>
Threads created inside the _USRDLL by creating CWinThread derived objects
will correctly create TLS data for those threads and work correctly.
<P>
_AFXDLL, which is closely tied to the executable, does not have these
restrictions.
