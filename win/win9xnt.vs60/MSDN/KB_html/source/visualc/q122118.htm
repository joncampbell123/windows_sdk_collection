The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The integrated debugger included with:
   Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, version 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 4.0, 5.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
During debugging it is common to find bugs and make minor code changes as
you continue debugging. However, editing source code while in the middle of
a debugging session may cause new or existing "Break At Location"
breakpoints to become misaligned with their corresponding instructions.
("Break At Location" is the default type if the breakpoints are set using
the toolbar button in the Visual C++ development environment.)
<P>
If, after editing, the source file remains the same in terms of line
positions, then breakpoints will appear as expected. However, if the source
file changes in terms of line positions, new breakpoint indicators (the red
dots) will shift position with respect to their corresponding instruction
by the number of lines added or deleted before each breakpoint.
<P>
Alternately, the red dot breakpoint indicators for pre-existing breakpoints
will follow their corresponding instructions during editing, but after the
rebuild warning, the program execution continues and the pre-existing
breakpoints are hit, the yellow current instruction pointer will be out of
sync with the corresponding instruction by the number of lines added or
deleted before each breakpoint.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The debugger does not track line number changes during editing, so it does
not update new breakpoint and the current instruction pointer indicators
accordingly.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
