The Information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.5, 1.51, 1.52
<LI>Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 2.0, 2.1, 4.0, 5.0
<LI>Microsoft FORTRAN Powerstation for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a
<LI>Microsoft FORTRAN Powerstation for Windows NT, versions 1.0, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
NOTE: This is assumed to apply, but has not been tested on Visual C++
versions 1.5x, 2.x, 4.x, or 5.0.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Hard drives that hold more than 528 MB and that use a CMD chipset interface
to an IDE controller cause Visual C++ and Fortran Powerstation to hang when
using 32-bit disk access.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
CMD supplies a driver for their IDE interface that conflicts with the
development environment when using 32-bit disk access. This has been
confirmed with Visual C++ version 1.5 and is believed to affect
other versions.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Obtain a later driver from the CMD electronic bulletin board service (BBS)
at (714) 454-1134, and turn off 32-bit access while using Visual C++. A
later version of the driver will fix the problem completely. Please check
the bulletin board for availability of later drivers.
<P>
If this does not solve the problem, the only option is to reformat in
a configuration that is less than or equal to 528 MB of storage space on
your hard disk.
<P>
NOTE: 1024 cylinders = 528 MB.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This problem originally surfaced on an HP Quantum LP5540A drive that was
formatted to 540 MB. Both HP and CMD have verified that this is a problem
with CMD's driver.
<P>
NOTE: This has not been tested on Visual C++ versions 1.51, 1.52, 2.0, or
2.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You probably have a CMD chip set if one of the following is true:

<OL><P><LI>You have the following in the SYSTEM.INI:
<P>
   Device = CMD640X.386
   Device = CMDINT13.386
<P>
   -or-

<P><LI>You have the following in the CONFIG.SYS:
<P>
   Device = 640X.SYS [or 640X2.SYS -  it depends on BIOS version]
<P></OL>
