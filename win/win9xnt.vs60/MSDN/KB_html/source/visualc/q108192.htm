<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses Microsoft's policy regarding the redistributable
files included with Visual C++ for Windows, version 1.0. This text is
taken from Section 6 of the Microsoft License Agreement included with
every Visual C++ version 1.0 product.
<P>
The Microsoft License Agreement states:
<P>
"REDISTRIBUTABLE COMPONENTS. Microsoft grants you a non-exclusive
royalty-free right to use and modify the source code version of those
portions of the SOFTWARE which are identified in the documentation as
the Sample Code("SAMPLE CODE") and the Microsoft Foundation Classes
("MFC"). You may not distribute the SAMPLE CODE or MFC, or any
modified version of the SAMPLE CODE or MFC, in the source code form.
Microsoft grants you a non-exclusive royalty-free right to reproduce
and distribute the object code version of those portions of the
SOFTWARE designated as
<P>

</PRE>(the "REDISTRIBUTABLES"); the SAMPLE CODE; MFC; and those portions of
the SOFTWARE which are identified in the documentation as the VBX controls
("VBX") provided that you: (a) distribute the REDISTRIBUTABLES, SAMPLE
CODE, MFC and VBX object code only in conjunction with and as a part of
your software application product which adds significant and primary
functionality; (b) do not use Microsoft's name, logo, or trademarks to
market your software application product; and (c) agree to indemnify,
hold harmless, and defend Microsoft from and against any claims or
lawsuits, including attorney's fees, that arise or result from the use
or distribution of your software application product. You may not
distribute the REDISTRIBUTABLES, MFC or VBX object code as part of any
software product that can be used to create other software product(s)
which use VBX controls. The SAMPLE CODE is limited to those files which
are located in the MSVC\SAMPLES and MSVC\MFC\SAMPLES subdirectories
which are created after the SOFTWARE is installed, using the default
settings in the Setup program, on a hard disk. "
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the VC++ 1.5 package, there is a REDIST.WRI file in the \\MSCV\REDIST
directory that indicates which files are redistributable. In addition, the
text of the .WRI file points the user to the License Agreement for the
terms under which redistribution may occur.
