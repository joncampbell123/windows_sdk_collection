<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This sample illustrates how to pass a socket connection between threads in
an MFC application. The sample consists of two projects, the Server and the
Client. The server creates a new thread for each connection to communicate
with the client.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Server</h3>
 
<P>
The server illustrates using sockets in multiple threads in an MFC
application. The server listens for connections. When a new connection is
requested, the server accepts the connection and then creates the thread to
handle the connection. When the server receives a message, it reverses the
message and sends it back to the client.
<P>
In MFC when you have a new connection it is necessary to accept the
connection in the thread that the listening socket is in. The Accept call
requires that you pass in a CAsyncSocket object. MFC then sets up
everything correctly so that the connection can be handle in the thread. If
you want to handle this connection in a different thread, just passing the
MFC object to the thread will not work correctly. To correctly set up
everything for the connection to be handled in a different thread, the
following steps are required:

<OL><P><LI>Detach the socket handle from the CAsyncSocket object in the thread
   where the connection was accepted.

<P><LI>Pass the socket handle to the thread.

<P><LI>In the thread, attach this handle to a CAsyncSocket derived object.
<P>
</OL>The Attach call in the thread sets up everything correctly for the socket
notifications to be sent to the thread you want to handle the connection.
<P>
The following code from the Server project illustrates this:
<P>
OnAccept for the listening socket.
<P>
<PRE>   void CListensoc::OnAccept(int nErrorCode)
   {
      // New connection is being established

      CSocket soc;

      // Accept the connection using a temp CSocket object.
      Accept(soc);

      // Create a thread to handle the connection.
      // The thread is created suspended so that we can
      // set variables in CConnectThread before it starts executing.
      CConnectThread* pThread =
         (CConnectThread*)AfxBeginThread(
            RUNTIME_CLASS(CConnectThread),
            THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL,
            0,
            CREATE_SUSPENDED);
   ...
      // Pass the socket to the thread by passing the socket handle.
      // You cannot pass a CSocket object across threads.
      pThread-&gt;m_hSocket = soc.Detach();

      // Now start the thread.
      pThread-&gt;ResumeThread();

      CAsyncSocket::OnAccept(nErrorCode);
   }


</PRE></OL>InitInstance of the thread.
<P>
<PRE>   BOOL CConnectThread::InitInstance()
   {
   ...
      // Attach the socket handle to a CSocket object.
      // This makes sure that the socket notifications are sent
      // to this thread.
      m_socket.Attach(m_hSocket);
   ...
   }

</PRE>The above code makes sure that the socket is set up correctly in the
secondary thread.
<P>
<P><h3>Client</h3>
 
<P>
The client accepts a host name to connect to. Once the connection is made,
the client allows you to send messages to the server. The client then
displays the message returned from the server.
<P>
The server listens on port 9000. The client tries to connect to this port
on the specified host.
<P>
The projects were created with Visual C++ version 5.0. However the code in
the samples should apply to the versions of MFC mentioned above.
