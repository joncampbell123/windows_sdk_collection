The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) included with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.1b, 4.2,
<P><PRE>     4.2b, 5.0
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides some guidelines for using DAO in regular DLLs. In
general, avoid performing any DAO construction, destruction, or operations
inside the DLL's InitInstance or ExitInstance functions. Otherwise, you
might see the following assertions:
<P>
<PRE>   Assertion failed in DAOCORE.CPP, line 36  (in Visual C++ 4.0)
   Assertion failed in APPCORE.CPP, line 585 (in Visual C++ 4.1)

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
All MFC/DAO objects in the DLL must be destroyed before the call to
AfxDaoTerm. Be careful about the scope of local and global DAO objects.
For example, the following code causes an assert:
<P>
<PRE>   SomeExportedFunc( .. )
   {
      // Only call for regular MFC DLL's
      #ifndef _AFXDLL
      AFX_MANAGE_STATE(AfxGetStaticModuleState());
      #endif

      CDaoDatabase db;
      db.Open(..);
      db.Close();
      AfxDaoTerm();
   }

</PRE>Because the DAO object db is a local variable, it remains in scope until
SomeExportedFunc returns. The call to AfxDaoTerm causes an assertion
because DAO terminates while db still has scope. Similarly, a global DAO
object has scope throughout the life of the DLL, so a call to AfxDaoTerm
also results in an assertion.
<P>
To ensure that your MFC/DAO objects are destroyed before calling
AfxDaoTerm, avoid global objects and create local objects dynamically by
using the new operator as in this example:
<P>
<PRE>   SomeExportedFunc( .. )
   {
      // Only call for regular MFC DLL's
      #ifndef _AFXDLL
      AFX_MANAGE_STATE(AfxGetStaticModuleState());
      #endif

      CDaoDatabase *DB = new CDaoDatabase;
      pDB-&gt;Open(..);

      // do something

      pDB-&gt;Close();

      // Destroy the object with delete
      delete pDB;

      // can now safely terminate DAO
      AfxDaoTerm();
   }

</PRE>A variation is to export special creation and termination functions as in
the following example. The advantage of this method is that DAO is running
and connections remain open during the life of the DLL. The disadvantage is
that the user of the DLL is responsible for explicitly calling these
special functions.
<P>
<PRE>   SomeExportedInitializeDAO( .. )
   {
      // Only call for regular MFC DLL's
      #ifndef _AFXDLL
      AFX_MANAGE_STATE(AfxGetStaticModuleState());
      #endif

      m_pDB = new CDaoDatabase;
      m_pDB-&gt;Open(..);
   }

</PRE>Then, to terminate MFC/DAO:
<P>
<PRE>   SomeExportedDestroyObjectsAndTerminateDAO( .. )
   {
      // Only call for regular MFC DLL's
      #ifndef _AFXDLL
      AFX_MANAGE_STATE(AfxGetStaticModuleState());
      #endif

     m_pDB-&gt;Close();
     delete m_pDB;
     AfxDaoTerm();
   }

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design. MFC/DAO objects need to be created after
CWinApp::InitInstance and destroyed before terminating DAO. By default,
MFC attempts to terminate DAO within CWinApp::ExitInstance.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The AfxDaoTerm helper function terminates the DAO database engine. In
applications, AfxDaoTerm is called automatically, but in DLLs, it must be
explicitly invoked before the DLL's ExitInstance function.
<P>
Here are some general guidelines to follow:

<UL><LI>Create any MFC/DAO objects after the DLL's InitInstance function. For
   additional information, please see the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../visualc/q147629.htm">Q147629</A></B>
<PRE>   TITLE     : PRB: Problems If ODBC or DAO in DLL's InitInstance or
               DLLMain

</PRE><LI>Destroy these objects before calling AfxDaoTerm.

<LI>Call AfxDaoTerm before calling the DLL's ExitInstance function.
<P>
</UL>Because the AfxDaoTerm helper function terminates the database engine, it
must be called after all MFC/DAO objects have been destroyed.
<P>
<P><h3>AfxDaoInit</h3>
 
<P>
This function initializes the DAO database engine. In most cases, you don't
need to call AfxDaoInit because the application calls it when it is needed.
AfxDaoInit is called during the construction of the first MFC/DAO object.
<P>
<P><h3>AfxDaoTerm</h3>
 
<P>
This function terminates the DAO database engine. Typically, this function
only needs to be called in a DLL; an application automatically calls
AfxDaTerm when it is needed.
<P>
When DAO is initialized, MFC will set the m_lpfnDaoTerm pointer in the
CWinApp class to point to AfxDaoTerm(). When CWinApp::ExitInstance is
invoked, by default it invokes the value of m_lpfnDaoTerm if it is set.
<P>
In a Regular DLL, you need to call AfxDaoTerm() before the default
ExitInstance is invoked because ExitInstance is invoked by DllMain. Visual
C++ 4.0 had a documented bug where the .exe's ExitInstance would shut down
DAO, causing an assertion when the Regular DLL's ExitInstance was called.
