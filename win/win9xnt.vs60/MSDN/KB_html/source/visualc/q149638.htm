The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) included with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 4.0, 4.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An MFC application that statically links to the MFC library may cause
strange problems when it's run under Win32s.
<P>
One known problem with static MFC applications in Win32s occurs when one
static MFC application is started and then two instances of another MFC
application that dynamically links to MFC in the Shared Library (Mfc40.dll)
are run. The second instance of the Shared Lib MFC application will fail
and return this message:
<P>
<PRE>   Win32s - Error. Initialization of dynamic link library failed.
   The process is terminating abnormally.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The static MFC library uses the static version of the C Run-Time Library.
However, the static version of the C Run-Time Library was not designed to
be used in Win32s.
<P>
Visual C++ versions 4.2 and later do not support building Win32s
applications.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Change the build settings for the application linking to MFC in the static
library to use MFC in the Shared Library (Mfc40.dll).
<P>
There are special versions of the Mfc40.dll and Msvcrt40.dll for running
under the Win32s platform that can be found in the \Win32s\Redist directory
on the Visual C++ 4.0 CD-ROM. These two DLLs will need to be distributed
with the new application.
