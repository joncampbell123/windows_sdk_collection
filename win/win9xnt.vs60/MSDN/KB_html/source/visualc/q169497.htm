<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to install DAO components, the following error message may
appear:
<P>
<PRE>   Another application is currently using JET file,
   close all applications and continue.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message can have one of following causes:

<UL><LI>Another application has opened one of the DAO/Jet DLL's. When a DLL is
   loaded in memory, Windows treats the file on the disk it was loaded from
   as read-only. This is by design.

<LI>The read-only attribute of the file that is being updated has been
   turned on.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve the first problem, if one of the DLL's that DAO is trying to
update is loaded in memory, then shut down all of your applications and
tell the setup program to continue. It is a good idea to perform a setup
with all applications shut down for this very reason.
<P>
The second problem is not as obvious because the setup program cannot
distinguish between a file with a read-only attribute set and a file that
is currently loaded into memory. The setup program will not identify the
specific file(s) that have read-only turned on.
<P>
Having the read-only flag set for DLL's is usually used as a low-level
virus protection, but it can also hamper the operation of programs using
those DLL's or attempting to upgrade them. From a DOS command prompt, go to
the Windows directory and type:
<P>
<PRE>   attrib -r *.* /s

</PRE>You may encounter some files that cannot be set as read-only. As long as
they are not EXE's or DLL's, it is not a problem.
<P>
You may also want to go to the \Program Files\Common Files directory and
perform the same procedure because DAO/Jet and other shared components are
often installed there as well.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
