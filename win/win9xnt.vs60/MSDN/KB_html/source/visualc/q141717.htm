The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) included with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 4.2b, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The DAOTable sample (DAOTBL.EXE) demonstrates how to use the MFC DAO
classes to create the following common database objects: databases,
tables, queries, fields, and indexes. This dialog-based application maps
the properties of these objects to controls the user can set or view. The
program source code is organized so that most database interaction is
isolated from the user interface code to ease finding examples of how to
use MFC DAO.
<P>
In addition to demonstrating the use of the MFC DAO classes, this sample
can be a useful tool for creating simple Microsoft Access databases. You
can create .mdb files from scratch, create and delete tables and queries,
add and delete fields and indexes in the tables, and modify existing
queries.
<P>
The following files contain the code that performs the database
operations. Additional files in the project provide the user interface and
high level database manipulation.
<P>
<PRE>   QUERYDEF.CPP, .H -- functions to create and use queries
   TABLEDEF.CPP, .H -- functions to create and use tables
   FIELD.CPP, .H    -- functions to create and use fields
   INDEX.CPP, .H    -- functions to create and use indexes
   DATABASE.CPP, .H -- functions to create and use databases

</PRE>To use this code and the MFC DAO classes, you must have Visual C++ 4.0 or
later.
<P>
NOTE: Beginning with Visual C++ 4.1, the DAOTable sample is included with
the Visual C++ CD.
<P>
<P><h3>Special Note for Visual C++ 4.1 Users</h3>
 
<P>
The DAOTABLE sample that shipped with Visual C++ 4.1 contains a bug that
will prevent you from creating fields that are of any type other than
text. To correct this problem, you can download the fixed sample as
directed below or make the following correction to the ADDTBDLG.CPP file:
<P>
Replace this line:
<P>
<PRE>   m_FI.m_bAllowZeroLength = TRUE;

</PRE>with this line:
<P>
<PRE>   m_FI.m_bAllowZeroLength = FALSE;

</PRE>This change will disable a workaround that was necessary to avoid a bug in
Visual C++ 4.0. In the download files (DAOTBL.EXE), the workaround code is
conditionally compiled depending on which version you are using to build
the sample. If you do not make the correction given in this section and
you run the application using the Visual C++ 4.1 DLLs, the following
exception will be thrown when you try to create nontext fields:
<P>
<PRE>   Couldn't create field--Exception: Invalid Operation.

<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The MFC DAO classes provide a way to directly use the Microsoft Jet
Database Engine. Although Visual C++ wizards automatically generate code
that will create and open recordsets for you based on implicitly created
database and workspace objects, the code they provide does not demonstrate
creating and manipulating MFC DAO objects directly. With MFC DAO classes,
you can create the majority of DAO objects and set their properties.
<P>
This sample demonstrates using the MFC DAO classes to create and use the
following DAO objects: databases, tables, queries, fields, and indexes.
Exception handling with both MFC exception macros and the C++ exception
mechanism is also shown. Further, DAO exceptions are put to use in
detecting the existence of objects in the DAO collections.
<P>
Listed below are all the files in the project (except those that are
common to all Visual C++ projects). Each file is shown with the type of
components it contains and a brief description.
