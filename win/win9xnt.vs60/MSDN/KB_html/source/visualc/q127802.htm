The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The integrated debugger included with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 2.0, 2.1, 4.0, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you choose Cancel when asked for the location of a source file while
debugging, you will not get another chance to map the disassembly code to
its corresponding source file.
<P>
For example, suppose that you have moved a source file belonging to the
debug version of a program to some other directory. When you step into that
code in the debugger, you will get a dialog box asking where the source
file is located. If you then choose to Cancel that dialog box, a
Disassembly window will be opened for the source. If you continue debugging
and later step through the code that causes the same source file to be
opened again, Visual C++ will automatically open up the Disassembly window
and will not ask again for the source location.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In trying to prevent asking the user for a file's location over and over
again, Visual C++ does not display the dialog box again if you chose Cancel
the first time. If you subsequently decide that you really do want to see
the source for a file, you must follow the steps listed below in the
Resolution section.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior:

<OL><P><LI>Close the Disassembly window.

<P><LI>Open the source file in an editor window.

<P><LI>Step into the code generated by that source, or double-click the
   current frame (the top) of the call stack. In Visual C++ 2.x, the
   Call Stack window can be opened by selecting Debug | Call Stack from
   the Visual Workbench main menu. In Visual C++ 4.0, the Call Stack
   window can be opened by choosing Call Stack from the View menu. This
   step reestablishes the source link.
<P>
</OL>Thereafter, the debugger will not open the Disassembly window for code
generated from that source, but will open the source file itself. You may
reopen the Disassembly window if you wish, and it will be properly mapped
to the open copy of the source file. If that source file is later closed
and then needs to be reopened in the editor, you will once again be asked
for the location of the file.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
