The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.51, 1.52
<LI>Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 4.0, 5.0
<LI>Fortran PowerStation for MS-DOS, Versions 1.0, 1.0a
<LI>Fortran PowerStation 32 for NT, version 1.0, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When building a project using one of the products mentioned above, one or
more of the following problems may occur:

<UL><LI>The Visual Workbench may return "0 error(s), 0 warning(s)", but no
   executable is produced.

<LI>From the command line, the linker may return "Run-Time Error R6000 -
   Stack Overflow."

<LI>The machine may hang during a build from the command line.
<P>
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A 386DX or 386SX computer was upgraded using the Cyrix "LC" family of
processors in place of the required processor from the Cyrix "RX" family.
<P>
For the 486DRX family, an early lot number had a bad mask that exhibits a
similar problem. It can be identified by the number on the top of the chip,
under the heat sink. The bad lot will be xx1###x where x is a letter and #
is a number. About 50% of these chips also fail due to the same timing
conditions as those above.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Cyrix builds CPUs for both OEMs and end users that plug into 386DX and
386SX sockets. The end user CPU family is labeled 486DRx or 486SRx, while
the OEM family of microprocessors is labeled 486DLC or 486SLC. The RX or
end user family of microprocessors differs from the LC or OEM family as
follows:

<UL><LI>The RX family does not require any BIOS or hardware modifications to
   existing 386 systems as does the LC family.

<LI>The RX family has integrated cache coherency logic built on the chip,
   unlike the LC family.

<LI>The Cyrix LC family is clearly marked "FOR OEM USE ONLY" to avoid end
   user confusion. This processor family should not be used in
   unmodified existing motherboard designs.
<P>
</UL>These fundamental differences in the chip family architecture allow Cyrix
to provide OEMs with a low cost, simple board and BIOS modification
solution to build 486 systems using the LC family, while giving end users a
distinct cost effective upgrade solution with the RX family.
<P>
Using an LC family processor in a system is not safe unless the necessary
hardware and BIOS modifications have been made in the design of the
motherboard. These changes, although not difficult for an OEM to make, are
not possible for an end user. Therefore, Cyrix does not support end users
who upgrade their 386DX or SX systems using the LC family of processors.
The following problems can occur when using the LC family of processors as
an upgrade to a 386 system:

<UL><LI>Loss of data on DMA devices such as SCSI or ESDI drives due to lack
   of cache coherency circuitry.

<LI>General I/O timing errors due to the I/O system being too slow for
   the LC family.
<P>
</UL>Because of this, problems can surface when using Microsoft development
tools that write to disk, such as Microsoft LINK.
<P>
End users who have upgraded using the LC family of processors should
return the LC processor and purchase an RX family processor. If further
information is needed, Cyrix can be contacted at (214) 968-8387.
