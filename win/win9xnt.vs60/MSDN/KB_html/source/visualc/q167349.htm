The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to create a new class derived from a generic class using
Insert.New Class wizard in the IDE, you may get the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   The New Class Wizard could not find the appropriate header file(s) to
   include for the base class(es) CTestClass. If you choose to derive
   from the class(es) anyway, you may need to manually add the
   appropriate header file(s) to C:\Temp\CTestClassDerived.h

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The New Class Wizard can not derive classes from the classes that are only
in the external dependencies. That is, if the base class' header file,
where the base class is declared, is not included in the project, the
wizard cannot add the header to the derived class' header file.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve the problem, you can do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Close the message box and derive the class anyway. Add the base class
   header file manually to the derived class' header file.
<P>
</UL>-or-

<UL><LI>Add the base class header file to the project. This can be done through
   the Project.Add to Project.Files menu in the IDE. After doing this, you
   should be able to derive the class without any warning messages.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following procedures can be used to reproduce the problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>UsE the AppWizard to generate a generic MFC application.

<P><LI>Create a header file named CTestClass.h in which you declare a base
   class. Make sure CTestClass.h is not added to the project.

<P><LI>Create a C++ source file named CTestClass.cpp in which you define all
   the member functions in the base class. You can add CTestClass.cpp to
   the project if you choose to.

<P><LI>If you did include CTestClass.cpp to the project in step 3, add it to
   the project now.

<P><LI>Derive a class from CTestClass. You can do so by choosing
   Insert.New Class menu in the IDE. In the "Class type:" choose "Generic
   Class". Name the derived class CTestClassDerived. Enter CTestClass as
   the class name for the "Derived From" text.

<P><LI>Click OK to save the derivation and exit the New Class dialog box.

<P><LI>You should get the error message box mentioned above before the dialog
   box is closed.
