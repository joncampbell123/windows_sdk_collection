The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Visual C++ version 1.0 for Windows has the following system
requirements:

<UL><LI>Personal computer with a 386 or higher processor running MS-DOS
   version 5.0 or later and Windows version 3.1 or later in 386
   enhanced mode.

<LI>4 megabytes (MB) of available memory (8 MB recommended).

<LI>One 3.5-inch high density diskette drive or a CD-ROM drive.

<LI>A hard disk with 25 MB available for minimum installation (50 MB for
   maximum installation).

<LI>A VGA or higher-resolution monitor.
<P>
</UL>- Microsoft mouse or compatible pointing device.
<P>
The Visual Workbench "User's Guide" incorrectly lists some of these
requirements on page 5. For example, it states that only 6 MB is
recommended and that either a 5.25-inch or a 3.5-inch high-density
floppy disk drive is needed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
While 5.25-inch high density disks are not in the package, they are
available upon request. Customers needing them should contact
Microsoft Customer Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
The hard disk requirements listed on the package are for a minimal
installation. A minimal installation needs about 25 MB (no help files,
samples, extra tools, and so forth). The professional edition default
installation requires approximately 38 MB, with 51 MB to 65 MB needed
for a maximum installation. For the Standard Edition, a default
installation takes about 33 MB, with 37 MB for a maximum installation.
The CD-ROM version can be installed to a hard disk, or the compiler be
can run from the CD with about 5 MB of tools installed on the hard
disk.
<P>
"Available memory" does not refer to the total amount of memory on a
machine, but rather to how much of that memory is actually free.
Generally, machines with less than 8 MB of total RAM need a Windows
swap file to increase the available memory. On most machines with less
memory, for example 4 MB total, if SMARTDRV and Windows are running
you may have only 1-2 MB actually available unless you have a swap
file.
<P>
To determine the amount of available memory, select Help from Program
Manager and choose About Program Manager. The memory available must be
at least 3 MB for Setup to run and at least 5 MB or more for building
any applications.
<P>
A small swap file may allow Setup to run. However, it needs to be
larger to compile most programs. For example, the Microsoft Foundation
Classes (MFC) sample SUPERPAD may need a 4-5 MB swap file to compile
depending on how much other available memory there is. On machines
with more memory, a swap file improves performance and may be
necessary if other memory resident software is running, or if a RAM
disk or EMS memory is allocated.
<P>
To view or modify the memory used for the Windows swap file, select
Control Panel, choose 386 Enhanced Options and then Virtual Memory.
See your Windows manual for more information on swap files.
