<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
With the release of MFC ODBC in Visual C++ 4.2, you can use both MFC and
the MFC ODBC classes within the multithreaded environment of an NT
Service. Neither the MFC DAO classes nor DAO SDK are thread-safe because
the underlying Jet engine is not thread-safe and cannot be used in an NT
Service.
<P>
The techniques presented here are valid for any multithreaded environment
with the MFC ODBC classes, not just an NT Service.
<P>
The remainder of this article explores the following three areas relating
to use of MFC-based Database classes within an NT Service:

<UL><LI>How an NT Service works
<LI>How to use MFC ODBC in a multithreaded environment
<LI>Why MFC DAO or DAO SDK cannot be used in a multithreaded environment
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>How an NT Service Works</h3>
 
<P>
An NT Service consists of code that is roughly similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   VOID WINAPI Main( VOID )
   {
       ...

       if (!StartServiceCtrlDispatcher(...))
           AddToMessageLog(TEXT("StartServiceCtrlDispatcher failed."));

       ...
   }

</PRE>When a service is started, the Service Control Manager waits for the
primary thread of the service to invoke a call to
StartServiceCtrlDispatcher(). This call triggers the creation of a named
pipe whose purpose is to provide a communication channel between the
service and the Service Control Manager. The primary thread acts as a
control dispatcher for the service. The service receives control requests
from the Service Control Manager via the control handler (callback
function). In addition, the StartServiceCtrlDispatcher() invokes a
secondary thread that contains the entry point of the service as specified
by the SERVICE_TABLE_ENTRY structure. If the StartServceCtrlDispatcher()
call succeeds, the StartServiceCtrlDispatcher() call in the primary thread
does not return until all running services in the process have terminated.
<P>
Any attempt to use database classes within a running service must not only
be thread-safe, but they must also be able to operate in the secondary
thread.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Use MFC ODBC in a Multithreaded Environment</h3>
 
<P>
With the release of Visual C++ 4.2, both MFC and the MFC ODBC database code
is safe to use in a multithreaded environment. However, you should keep
the following points in mind:

<UL><LI>Use an ODBC Driver That Is Thread-Safe.
<P>
   The multithreading support for the ODBC classes has some limitations.
   Because these classes wrap the ODBC API, they are restricted to the
   multithreading support of the components on which they are built. For
   example, there are many ODBC drivers that are not thread-safe;
   therefore, the MFC ODBC classes are not thread-safe if you use them with
   one of these drivers. You should verify whether your particular driver
   is thread-safe, as well as any components it uses.

<LI>Use a Global Instance of CCriticalSection to Provide Synchronization
   when Using MFC ODBC Classes.
<P>
   While the MFC ODBC classes are thread-safe, it is the programmers job to
   ensure synchronization of the handle state. The safest way to do this is
   to use a CCriticalSection object, and Lock any methods that manipulate a
   handle in either CRecordset or CDatabase--in particular any method that
   modifies the CRecordset::m_hStmt member.

<LI>Avoid Using MFC ODBC Globally or Across Multiple Threads.
<P>
   When creating a multithreaded application, you should be very careful
   in using multiple threads to manipulate the same object. For example,
   using the same CRecordset object in two threads may cause problems when
   retrieving data; a fetch operation in one thread may overwrite the data
   fetched in the other thread.
<P>
   A global Database object, even protected by a global instance of
   CCriticalSection, may not be safe.

<LI>Use a System DSN for Your ODBC DataSource.
<P>
   Any ODBC DataSource used by the MFC ODBC classes within an NT Service
   must be a System DSN. Without a System DSN you see the following error
   when trying to open the data source:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Data source name not found and no default driver specified
      State:IM002,Native:0,Origin:[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager]
</PRE><P>
   The process for creating a System DSN is identical to creating a regular
   data source. Open the 32-bit ODBC Administrator (in the Control Panel)
   and click the button that says "System DSN" to create or modify your
   System DataSources.
<P>
   See the KB article listed in the REFERENCES section below for details.

<LI>It May Be Necessary to Impersonate a Valid NTUser.
<P>
   When using an ISAPI dynamic-link library (DLL) to get to a data source
   that is not on the same machine as the ISAPI DLL. For example, an ISAPI
   DLL using MFC ODBC to manipulate data on a SQL Server that is on a
   different machine requires a valid NT Domain userid and password.
   Otherwise, the NT machine running SQL Server does not allow the ISAPI
   DLL to make the connection.
<P>
   Win32 provides several functions allowing you to login with a valid
   userid and password, letting the ISAPI DLL "impersonate" a valid user.
<P>
   See the two KB articles listed in the REFERENCES section below for
   details.

<LI>Using MFC ODBC in a NT Service Is Just Like Using MFC ODBC in a
   Console Application.
<P>
   An NT Service is similar to a console application in that it does not
   offer the standard windows Message Pump. The MFC ODBC classes, with
   Visual C++ 4.2, have been written to be more friendly to console
   applications. But there are some issues you need to be aware of.
<P>
   See the KB article listed in the REFERENCES section below for details.
<P>
</UL>Why MFC DAO or DAO SDK Cannot Be Used in a Multithreaded Environment
 
<P>
DAO version 3.x is a single-threaded inproc server and was originally
written for Access 1.x and 2.0 and Visual Basic 3.0--both of which are
single-threaded. This means that clients (MFC DAO or DAO SDK) can
use DAO via custom interfaces only from the first thread in the process
that initialized COM—that is, 'primary' thread.
<P>
If the client has already initialized COM in the primary thread and then
calls CoCreateInstance in the secondary thread asking for the IDAODBEngine
interface, CoCreateInstance fails. This fails because COM sees that DAO is
not marked as apartment or free threaded in the registry, calls
DllGetClassObject from the primary thread, gets the IDAODBEngine interface,
tries to marshal it back to the secondary thread, and fails.
<P>
See the KB article listed in the REFERENCES section below for details.
