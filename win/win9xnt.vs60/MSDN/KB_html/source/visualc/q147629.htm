The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) included with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you use ODBC or DAO in the InitInstance or DLLMain functions of a DLL,
your application may fail with an "Access Violation" or display some other
unanticipated behavior. This can occur when you use the MFC Database
Classes (ODBC-based or DAO-based), the ODBC API, or the dbDao classes
provided with the DAO SDK.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The reason for this behavior is that ODBC drivers, DAO, or any of their
underlying components may spawn multiple threads. Creating threads during
initialization of a Win32 DLL can leave Windows in an undefined state.
<P>
When a Win32 DLL is loaded, Windows calls the DLL's DllMain function with a
reason for calling of DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH.
<P>
When a new thread is created in Win32, each DLL in the process space will
have its DllMain function called by Windows. Windows signals that a new
thread has been created by passing a reason for calling of
DLL_THREAD_ATTACH.
<P>
For a regular DLL that uses MFC, MFC supplies a DllMain that calls
InitInstance. If you call a function in InitInstance that directly or
indirectly creates one or more threads, you may experience unexpected
behavior. This is because your application is within the context of DllMain
(in InitInstance) with a DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH call, and creating a thread
will result in Windows needing to call your DllMain again with a
DLL_THREAD_ATTACH. The behavior resulting from this action is undefined.
<P>
If you are writing an extension DLL, you must supply your own
implementation of the DllMain function. If you directly or indirectly
create threads within this DllMain function, you will also experience this
problem.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Do not create threads explicitly or implicitly within the context of
DllMain.
<P>
Provide a function in your DLL for complex initialization that you can call
outside of the scope of DllMain.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Currently the behavior described in this article is exhibited when using
the Microsoft Access version 3 ODBC driver, using the ODBC SDK, or using
MFC ODBC-based database classes. It can also occur when instantiating
instances of MFC DAO-based database classes or the dbDao classes.
<P>
This behavior is not limited to a specific ODBC driver, DAO, or ODBC in
general. You may experience this type of behavior with any API that creates
threads.
<P>
If you suspect that this might be the cause of failure in your application,
you can verify it by putting a breakpoint in the DllMain function and
examining how many times it is called and by examining the dwReason
parameter that is passed to it. If this is a regular DLL that uses MFC, set
the breakpoint in MFC's DllMain function.
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Code</h3>
 
<P>
The following code is for MFC ODBC-based database classes but applies
equally well to MFC DAO-based database classes, or the dbDao classes.
<P>
<PRE>   // This code should reproduce the problem for a regular DLL that uses
   // MFC.

   BOOL CMyDllApp::InitInstance()
   {
     CDatabase db;
     if(db.Open("MyDataSource")) //Open Microsoft Access 3 ODBC datasource
       db.Close();
     ...
   }

   // To fix the problem, put the code in your own initialize function
   // that you call explicitly from your application.

   BOOL CMyDllApp::MyInitFunction()
   {
     CDatabase db;
     if(db.Open("MyDataSource")) //Open an Access 3 ODBC datasource
       db.Close();
     ...
   }
