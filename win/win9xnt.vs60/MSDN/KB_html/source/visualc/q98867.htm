<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) included with:
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, version 1.0
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Under some circumstances, an application created with Microsoft
Foundation Classes version 2.0 allocates temporary objects on the
application heap and does not delete them. While the memory
diagnostics in the debugging version of the Foundation Classes
libraries do not detect this memory leak, the error is apparent when
Heap Walker is used to monitor the heap.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A HANDLE is attached to both a permanent object and a temporary
object. When the HANDLE is detached from the permanent object, it is
also detached from the temporary object. Consequently, the temporary
object is never destroyed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Do not remove the HANDLE from the temporary map when it is detached.
To do so, remove one line of code from the WINHAND.CPP source file. In
Visual C++, remove line 158 which reads as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   m_temporaryMap.RemoveKey((MAPTYPE)h);

</PRE>It is also necessary to change the arguments to some ASSERT macros to
prevent detaching a temporary object from causing an assertion failure. It
is not necessary to Detach a temporary object because it generally serves
no useful purpose. However, because Microsoft Foundation Class Libraries
version 1.0 support this practice, version 2.0 supports it as well. In
WINHAND.CPP, change lines 145 and 173 from
<P>
<PRE>   ASSERT(ph[0] == h);

</PRE>to:
<P>
<PRE>   ASSERT(ph[0] == h || ph[0] == NULL);

</PRE>After making these changes, rebuild the Microsoft Foundation Class
Libraries using the MAKEFILE in the library source directory (by default,
C:\MSVC\MFC\SRC). The MAKEFILE supports building all variations of the
Foundation Class Libraries. For more information on using the MAKEFILE,
please refer to the comments at the beginning of the MAKEFILE.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft
Foundation Class Libraries version 2.0 for Windows. This problem was
corrected in the MFC libraries version 2.5, which ships with Microsoft
VC++ version 1.5.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Foundation Class Libraries maintain two maps for each HANDLE used
in the Microsoft Windows environment. The Libraries maintain four map
pairs, for HDCs, HGDIOBJECTs, HMENUs, and HWNDs. For each handle type,
the Libraries maintain two separate maps: a temporary map and a
permanent map. When the Library maps a HANDLE to a C++ object, it
checks the permanent map first and then checks the temporary map.
<P>
Under some circumstances, a HANDLE appears in both maps. A serious
memory leak occurs when a HANDLE is Detached (or unmapped) from its
permanent C++ object. This removes the HANDLE from both maps even
though the temporary object is not destroyed. Because the temporary
C++ object is not present in the temporary map when the
CWinApp::OnIdle() function attempts to delete all temporary objects,
the temporary C++ object remains in memory. For example, the following
code example causes a memory leak that involves one temporary CDC
object:
<P>
<PRE>   CDC* pDC = CDC::FromHandle(hDC); // creates temporary object
   CDC dc;
   dc.Attach(hDC); // now in permanent map as well
   dc.Detach(hDC); // removed from temp and permanent map
   // pDC is never deleted

</PRE>Even though the code sequence above is rare, it occurs quite often
processing objects in the CFrameWnd class. CFrameWnd processes a
WM_ERASEBKGND message in an OnEraseBkgnd handler. Windows sends
WM_ERASEBKGND before it sends the WM_PAINT message. The Library
creates a temporary object in the OnEraseBkgnd handler. When the
application receives the WM_PAINT message, it creates a permanent
CPaintDC object on the stack. This creates a situation similar to that
above except that the temporary and permanent objects result from
processing different messages.
<P>
Because CWinApp::OnIdle() is not called between the WM_ERASEBKGND
message and WM_PAINT messages, the temporary object created processing
the WM_ERASEBKGND message is not removed.
<P>
This problem does not generally affect applications created in
AppWizard because CFrameWnd objects in an application that uses CView
child windows do not receive WM_PAINT messages under normal
circumstances.
