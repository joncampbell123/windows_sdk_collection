The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you convert a Visual C++ 4.x project, the following error messages may
appear:
<P>
On Windows NT 4.0:
<P>
<PRE>    MSDEV.EXE - Application Error
    The instruction at :0x00000004" referenced memory at "0x00000004". The
    memory could not be read.

</PRE>After selecting OK you may get the following error:
<P>
<PRE>    MSDEV.EXE - Application Error
    The instruction at :0x5f402181" referenced memory at "0x00000004". The
    memory could not be read.

</PRE>On Windows 95:
<P>
<PRE>    This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
    Details shows:
      MSDEV caused an invalid page fault in module &lt;unknown&gt; at
      00de:00000009

</PRE>After selecting OK you get the following error:
<P>
<PRE>    This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
    Details shows:
      MSDEV caused an invalid page fault in module &lt;unknown&gt; at
      0137:5f402181

</PRE>-or-
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   Details shows:
     MSDEV caused an invalid page fault in module SSSCC.DLL at
     0137:48248c18.

</PRE>Note that in both cases the address in the first message may vary, but the
second one will be consistent.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are two cases that will reproduce this problem:
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1</h3>
 
<P>
Projects that are missing a top-level project in the directory where the
.MDP and .MAK files are located crash.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 2</h3>
 
<P>
Projects for which the .MDP and .MAK files have been renamed and have a
subdirectory with the same name as the upper-level original project.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Case 1</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In Visual C++ 4.0, create a workspace called Test of the Application
   type.

<P><LI>Insert a top-level project called Top of any type.

<P><LI>Using the Build|Configurations menu, remove the Test project and then
   close the project.

<P><LI>In Visual C++ 5.0, open the Test workspace's Test.mdp file. Visual C++
   5.0 converts the project. MSDEV crashes and the error messages noted
   above appear.
<P>
</OL><h3>Resolution for Case 1</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Under the Test directory which was created for the Test workspace there
   is a "Top" subdirectory. Rename this the "Top" subdirectory to "x" (any
   name is acceptable).

<P><LI>In Visual C++ 5.0, open the Test workspace's Test.mdp file. Visual C++
   5.0 converts the project.

<P><LI>Rename the "x" subdirectory to the original name and the project will
   work as expected.
<P>
</OL>In the general case, you may have several projects. Renaming any one of the
subdirectories as shown above will work around this bug.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Case 2</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In Visual C++ 4.0, create a workspace called Test of the Application
   type. It should be located in the Test directory.

<P><LI>Insert a subproject of any type called Sub.

<P><LI>Close the workspace.

<P><LI>In the Test directory, rename Test.m?? to foo.*

<P><LI>Create a subdirectory called Test\Test.

<P><LI>In Visual C++ 5.0 open foo.mdp. MSDEV crashes and the error messages
   noted above appear.
<P>
</OL><h3>Resolution of Case 2</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Rename the Test\Test subdirectory to Test\[anything].

<P><LI>Convert the project using Visual C++ 5.0. Now you can restore the
   subdirectory name to Test\Test.
<P>
</OL>Please note that for case 2 the upper-level directory name is of no
consequence. What is important is that there is a subdirectory with the
same name as the original project name.
<P>
These scenarios apply to all versions of Visual C++ 4.x.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
