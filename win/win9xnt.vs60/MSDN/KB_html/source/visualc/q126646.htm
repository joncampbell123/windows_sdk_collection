The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft C/C++ Compiler (CL.EXE) included with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, versions 2.0, 2.1, 4.0, 4.1,
<P><PRE>     4.2, 5.0
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When compiling an MFC application using the single-threaded run-time
library, you receive the following two unresolved external error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   nafxcwd.lib(thrdcore.obj) : error LNK2001:
    unresolved external symbol "__beginthreadex"
   nafxcwd.lib(thrdcore.obj) : error LNK2001:
    unresolved external symbol "__endthreadex"

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Starting with version 3.0, all MFC classes are "thread safe" and require
the multi-threaded run-time libraries to link successfully. Many people
try to use the single-threaded run-time libraries because they assume these
libraries are needed to enable the application to run in Win32s. This
is not the case. MFC versions 3.0 and later will use a single thread, so as
long as you are not creating additional threads in the application, the
application will run under Win32s.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid these unresolved external errors, do not set the Project Settings
to Single-Threaded for an MFC version 3.0 or later application. This
setting can be changed by doing the following:
<P>
On Visual C 2.x and 5.0:

<OL><P><LI>Select the PROJECT menu (and continue Steps 2 through 5 below).
<P>
</OL>On Visual C 4.x:

<OL><P><LI>Select the Build menu.

<P><LI>Select the SETTINGS... option.

<P><LI>Select the tab, C/C++.

<P><LI>Select CODE GENERATION on the Category list box.

<P><LI>Finally, make a selection other than SINGLE-THREADED on the Use Run Time
   Library list box.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For Win32s, MFC versions 3.0 and later do not create additional threads.
However, the MFC does make use of Thread Local Storage (TLS) in the
multithreaded libraries to provide per-process data in DLLs that are used
by multiple applications under Win32s.
<P>
In the Project Settings dialog box, if you select the run-time library
option to link "Multithreaded using DLL," you can take advantage of using
the shared DLL, MSVCRTx0.DLL (where "x" represents the major version of
Visual C++). There are separate versions of MSVCRTx0.DLL for Windows NT and
Win32s that cannot be interchanged. "Multithreaded using DLL" is required
when building an AFXDLL.
<P>
Linking to the multithreaded libraries may cause multiple defined symbol
errors. This usually occurs when the application uses user-created or
third-party static libraries that were created as single-threaded.
<P>
The best solution in this case is to rebuild the static libraries to use
the same library options as MFC (either /MT or /MD, depending on which MFC
lib is used).
<P>
In this case, you may be able to use /NOD:LIBC.LIB. However, if the static
library accesses any static global C Run-Time data such as _errno or stdin,
you will get unresolved externals on these symbols.
<P>
One solution which will always work is to isolate the single-threaded code
into a DLL, and call it, protected by semaphores, from the multithreaded
MFC code.
