<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes issues you may encounter when using the Internet
Mail service for Microsoft Outlook 97 with various Internet Service
Providers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>SMTP Submissions Not Working With IBM.NET</h3>
 
<P>
If you send a message that contains a line with only a period, all text
below that line is lost. This problem is with IBM.NET's SMTP server. This
problem occurs using Outlook, Outlook Express, Internet Mail and News,
Netscape Communicator, and Eudora. If you use Telnet to send RFC-821
compliant text directly to the IBM.NET SMTP server, the server fails to
process the text correctly.
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot Download Mail from USA.NET</h3>
 
<P>
You may not be able to download Internet mail from USA.NET. The USA.NET
server used a Line Feed (LF) character rather than a Carriage Return Line
Feed (CRLF) character to terminate message lines. The POP server
specification states that lines are terminated with CRLF characters. This
problem has been corrected.
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot Download Mail From WIN.NET</h3>
 
<P>
You may not be able to download Internet mail from WIN.NET. This problem is
based on customer reports. This problem has been corrected.
<P>

independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
