<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Microsoft Outlook 97, you may receive one of the following
error messages:
<P>
<PRE>  Outlook caused an Invalid Page Fault in Module OLE32.DLL

  The instruction at &lt;xxxxxxxxxx&gt; referenced memory at &lt;xxxx:xxxx&gt;. The
  memory could not be written.

  An Application Error has occurred in Outlook.exe.

  Stack Overflow.

  Could not start processing services.

  Invalid Stack Fault in OLE32.DLL

</PRE>Note: the last error message can occur when opening Outlook or when opening
any office application that that has journaling enabled.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if one of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The Office item log file Offitems.log is damaged.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>The Outlook item log file OUTITEMS.LOG is damaged.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To troubleshoot this error, attempt to isolate the problem to corruption in
a specific log file. The Outlook journal log files  are stored in
c:\windows or c:\winnt; if you have installed Windows to another location
search for them in that location.
<P>
To check for corruption in the log file, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Rename the Offitems.log file, (to Offitems.old for example).

<P><LI>Restart Outlook and wait at least 30 seconds for the error to appear.

<P><LI>If the error does not appear, the problem has been isolated.

<P><LI>If the error reappears, then rename the Outitems.log file.

<P><LI>Restart Outlook and wait at least 30 seconds for the error to appear.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The log files store Journal information on the create, open, close and save
events for any file in Office 97 (Offitems.log) or any Outlook item such as
mail, appointments, or tasks (Outitems.log). If renaming the log files
allows Outlook to start successfully, Outlook regenerates the log files.
However, any journal information contained in the original log file will be
lost.
<P>
