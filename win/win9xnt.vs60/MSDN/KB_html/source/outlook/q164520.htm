The information in this article applies to:

<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to convert files from Lotus Organizer to
Microsoft Outlook 97 and some of the problems you may encounter.
<P>
Organizer is manufactured by Lotus, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To import an Organizer file into Outlook, you must have the Organizer
program installed on your computer. You must also install the Lotus
Organizer Converters that come with Outlook. These converters are not
installed when you choose Typical Installation during setup.
<P>
To install the Organizer Converter Files:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button point to Settings and click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Click Add/Remove Programs.

<P><LI>Click Microsoft Office 97 or Microsoft Outlook 97 and click Add/Remove.

<P><LI>In the Setup dialog box, click Add/Remove.

<P><LI>Click Microsoft Outlook and click Change Options.

<P><LI>Click the check box next to Lotus Organizer Converters  to select it,
   click OK, and then Continue.
<P>
</OL>Two different Outlook Converters are supplied for different versions of
Organizer, one for versions 1.0 and 1.1 and one for version 2.1. It is
important that you choose the proper converter for the version of the file
being converted.
<P>
NOTE: Neither of these supplied converters supports Lotus Organizer 2.0
files. Organizer 2.0 files can be exported as comma delimited text files
and imported into Outlook. Organizer 97 (3.0) files can be saved in version
2.1 format, and then imported into Outlook. Also, a product named
IntelliSync for Windows CE, can be used for direct-connect synchronization
between a Windows CE based handheld PC using Organizer 97 and another PC
using Outlook.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Import an Organizer File</h3>
 
<P>
To import an Organizer file, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, Click Import and Export.

<P><LI>Click "Import from Schedule+ or another program or file," and click
   Next.

<P><LI>Click Lotus Organizer 1.0, 1.1, or Lotus Organizer 2.1, and click Next.

<P><LI>Type the Organizer file name in the File to import window, and click
   Next.

<P><LI>Click Import "&lt;filename&gt;" into "&lt;foldername&gt;" and click Map Custom
   Fields (where &lt; name&gt; is the file or folder name you want to use).

<P><LI>Map "&lt;Organizer fieldname&gt;" to "&lt;Outlook fieldname&gt;" and click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Manually Map Organizer Fields to Outlook Fields</h3>
 
<P>
Most fields will automatically map from Organizer fields to the proper
Outlook fields. However, it is very important that you verify the mapping
to assure each Organizer field is mapped to the appropriate Outlook field.
<P>
For those Organizer entries containing more than one category, only the
first category in the list will be imported to Outlook.
<P>
<P><h3>Calls Not Imported</h3>
 
<P>
Organizer Call entries are not imported to Outlook.
<P>
<P><h3>Notes Not Imported</h3>
 
<P>
Organizer note entries are not imported to Outlook.
<P>
<P><h3>Planner Entries</h3>
 
<P>
Organizer Planner entries are imported as Appointments in Outlook's
Calendar. Those spanning multiple days are imported as recurring
appointments.
<P>
<P><h3>Repeated Events</h3>
 
<P>
Organizer Repeated Events are imported as a series of individual events in
Outlook.
