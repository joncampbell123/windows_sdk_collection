<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to sort your Tasks by Company in Microsoft Outlook 97, you
receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   The field "Company" that you want to sort by is not shown in the view.
   Do you want to show it?

</PRE>If you click Yes, an unpopulated Company field is added to your Tasks list,
even if you already have the Company field displayed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Outlook does not sort by multi-value fields.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You can group your Tasks by multi-value fields. Use one of the following
methods to group by Company.

<OL><P><LI>On the View menu, point to Current View, then click Detailed List.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Group By.

<P><LI>In the Group items by box, click Company.
<P>
   NOTE: If the field you want is not in the Group Items By box, click a
   different field set in the Select Available Fields From box.

<P><LI>Click Ascending or Descending for the sort order of the group headings.

<P><LI>To show the field you are grouping items by, select the Show Field in
   View check box.

<P><LI>To group by subgroups, select a field in the Then By box.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Click the toolbar button, Group By Box. An area appears directly
   above the tasks.

<P><LI>Drag the column heading you want to group items by into the Group By
   Box.

   the Group By Box. Use the double-arrow marker to position the column
   headings before or after other headings in the Group By Box.
