The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Outlook 97, when you delete items from a Mailbox folder of
another user where you have deletion privileges, the deleted items go into
your Deleted Items folder rather than that of the mailbox owner.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Outlook version 8.02 provides a Windows registry setting to switch the
destination of deleted items to the mailbox owner's Deleted Items folder.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook 97 for
Windows. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Outlook 97 version 8.02
for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open a mailbox to which you have access privileges.

<P><LI>Open a folder to which you have delete privileges.

<P><LI>Delete an item.
<P>
</OL>RESULT: the deleted item goes into your Deleted Items folder, rather than
that of the mailbox owner. This is true even if you have full rights to the
other user's Deleted Items folder.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Switch the Destination of Deleted Items</h3>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
before you edit the registry.

<P><LI>Right-click on the DelegateWastebasketStyle key and click Modify. If the
   Key is not present, see NOTE below.

<P><LI>Change the Value data in the "Edit DWORD Value" dialog box to one of the
   following values:
<P>
<P><PRE>      8 (stores deleted items in your folder)
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      4 (stores deleted items in the mailbox owner's folder)
</PRE>
<P><LI>Exit the Registry Editor.

<P><LI>Restart Outlook.
