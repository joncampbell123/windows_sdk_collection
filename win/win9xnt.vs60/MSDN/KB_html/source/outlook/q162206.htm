The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Personal Folders are folders that you create to store mail messages on your
local hard disk or on another server. You add a main Personal Folders as a
service to the User Profile and give it a file name. Personal Folders have
a .PST extension. For MSMail Post Offices, a Personal Folders is set up
automatically because the Inbox and Outlook folders have to reside there.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Personal Folders file contains folders, messages, forms, and files. You
work with a Personal Folders file as you would with any other file, and you
can save, copy, and move a .pst file to another location on your hard disk,
a floppy disk, or a server. You can also designate a Personal Folders file
as the delivery location for your incoming messages.
<P>
To set the delivery location, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Services.

<P><LI>In the Services dialog box, click the Delivery tab.

<P><LI>In the "Deliver new mail to the following location box," click where you
   want to send and receive messages.
<P>
   If you set up a computer to use Remote Mail, you must click the name of
   a personal folder file. If you set up a computer to use offline
   folders, you must click the name of your Microsoft Exchange Server
   mailbox.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Quit and restart Outlook.
<P>
</OL><h3>Backing Up Your Personal Folders File</h3>

</OL><h3>Backing Up Outlook Folders</h3>
 
<P>
Outlook folders, such as Calendar, Contacts, Journal, Tasks, and e-mail
message folders are components of the Personal Folders file. This procedure
will back up an individual Outlook folder in a different Personal Folders
(.pst) file. Follow these steps to individually back up your Calendar,
Contacts, Tasks, Journal, or mail folders:

<OL><P><LI>On the Outlook File menu, click Import And Export to open the Import
   And Export Wizard.

<P><LI>In the "Choose an action to perform" list, click to select "Export to
   a personal folder file (.pst)," and then click Next.

<P><LI>In the "Select the folder to export from" list, click to select the
   Outlook item folder you want to back up. For example, select your
   Contacts folder to back up your Contacts in a different .pst file.

<P><LI>Click Next.

<P><LI>In the "Save exported file as" box, type the path and file name of
   a destination .pst file or click Browse and select a destination .pst
   file.

<P><LI>Under Options, click the button corresponding with how you want
   duplicate items treated, and click Finish.
<P>
</OL><h3>Exporting Outlook Folders to Another File Format</h3>
 
<P>
Follow these steps to export your Outlook folders to a different file
format:

<OL><P><LI>On the Outlook File menu, click Import And Export to open the Import
   And Export Wizard.

<P><LI>In the "Choose an action to perform" list, click to select "Export to
   a file," and click Next.

<P><LI>In the "Select the folder to export from" list, click to select the
   Outlook item folder you want to export. For example, select your
   Contacts folder to export your Contacts in a different file format.

<P><LI>Click Next.

<P><LI>In the "Create a file of type" list, click to select the export file
   format, and click Next.

<P><LI>In the "Save exported file as" box type a path and file name, or click
   Browse to select a destination file.

<P><LI>Click Next.

<P><LI>Click "Map Custom Fields" if you want to control how fields export;
   otherwise, click Finish to start the export.
<P>

does not allow for advanced workgroup information sharing. This
functionality is available only when the default delivery is set
to the exchange server mailbox.
