The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Outlook 97 when you create a "New Contact from Same Company" from a
contact that contains a fax number, your Outlook Address Book may not
include the new contact fax information.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, open the new contact, re-enter the fax number,
save and close the new contact.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook 97.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Outlook 97 when you choose to create a "New Contact from Same Company,"
or "Save and New in Company" for an existing contact, one of the following
situations result:

<UL><LI>The new contact inherits the old contact's fax number, but the new
   contact's e-mail address field is blank. If you do not enter a new
   e-mail address and you save the new contact with a new name, the contact
   is not present in the Outlook Address Book.

<LI>The new contact inherits the old contact's fax number, but the new
   contact's e-mail address field is blank. If you enter a new e-mail
   address and save this new contact, there is no new entry in the Outlook
   Address Book for this new contact's fax number, but there is an entry
   for the new contact's e-mail address.
<P>
</UL>Normally the Outlook Address Book includes entries for a contact with
either a fax number or an e-mail address or both. When you create a "New
Contact from Same Company," the new contact inherits the fax number as
expected, but the Outlook Address Book does not list the new contact's fax
number.
