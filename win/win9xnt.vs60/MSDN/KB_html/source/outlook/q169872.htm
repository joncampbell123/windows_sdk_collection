The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Outlook 97, you can schedule the use of resources such as
conference rooms and AV equipment by defining an e-mail account for each
resource. To reserve these resources you invite them to meetings and
activities just like individuals. These resources can be set up to
automatically accept or reject scheduling requests, or you can assign a
delegate to handle these decisions. If you want to centralize booking of
several resources you can assign a single delegate to multiple resource
accounts.
<P>
This article describes how to set up a resource account and how to set up a
delegate account to control one or more resources.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you want to centralize booking of several resources, you can assign a
single delegate to multiple resource accounts and then configure the
delegate to respond to meeting requests automatically. All meeting requests
sent to the resource accounts are forwarded to the delegate for processing.
The advantage to this method is that only one computer is required to
handle multiple resources. For example, you can set up a dedicated
computer, with Outlook logged on to the delegate account, to handle the
booking of several conference rooms at once.
<P>
<P><h3>Delegate Account Setup</h3>
 
<P>
You must create an e-mail account for the delegate. You can create a
dedicated delegate account, or you can use an existing user account. For
example, you may use a receptionist's e-mail account for booking all
conference rooms in a building.
<P>
<P><h3>Configure the Delegate Account</h3>
 
<P>
To configure the delegate account, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Open the delegate account in Outlook.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click Advanced Scheduling on the Calendar tab.

<P><LI>Click to select the desired options under, "Processing of meeting
   requests."

<P><LI>Click OK and OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Resource Account Setup</h3>
 
<P>
To set up a resource in Outlook, first create an e-mail account for each
resource just as you would for a workgroup member. Assign a descriptive
name to the resource such as, "Room 101." If a delegate is assigned to a
resource, you can configure the resource account so that meeting requests
go directly to the delegate.
<P>
<P><h3>Configure the Resource Account</h3>
 
<P>
To configure the resource account, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Open the new resource account in Outlook.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click Advanced Scheduling on the Calendar tab.

<P><LI>Click to select the desired options under, "Processing of meeting
   requests."

<P><LI>Click OK to close the Advanced Scheduling dialog.

<P><LI>On the Delegates tab, click Add to add the name of the
   delegate account.

<P><LI>In the Delegate Permission box, click Editor in the Calendar
   list and click to select, "Delegate receives copies of
   meeting-related messages sent to me" and then click OK.

<P><LI>On the Delegates tab, click to select, "Send meeting requests and
   responses only to my delegate, not to me" and then click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Automatic Booking of Resource Requests</h3>
 
<P>
To enable automatic booking of resource requests do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Open the delegate account in Outlook.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>On the E-mail tab, click to select "Process requests and responses on
   arrival."

<P><LI>On the Calendar tab click Advanced Scheduling.

<P><LI>Under "Processing of meeting requests," select the options you want to
   use. Select all three options for complete automatic booking of
   all meeting requests orwarded to the delegate. The delegate account
   must remain logged on for automatic booking of resources.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the new resource and delegate options
to update on the Microsoft Exchange server. The local computer must remain
idle for approximately 30 seconds to allow the processing to occur.
