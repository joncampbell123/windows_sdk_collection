The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to back up data created in Outlook including e-
mail messages, contacts, appointments, tasks, notes, and journal entries.
Outlook stores its data in Messaging Application Programming Interface
(MAPI) folders. MAPI folders can be stored in a file on your hard drive
called a Personal Folder file, or if you are using Outlook with Exchange
Server, the data can be stored in a mailbox on the server.
<P>
This article covers the following topics:

<UL><LI>Making a backup copy of a Personal Folder file

<LI>Importing or Exporting Personal Folder data

<LI>How To Back Up Data Using Outlook with Microsoft Exchange Server
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Making a Backup Copy of a Personal Folder File (.PST file)</h3>
 
<P>
If you are not using Outlook with Microsoft Exchange Server, Outlook will
store all of its data in a Personal Folder file. If you want to back up or
export a particular folder such as Contacts or Calendar, use the steps in
the section: Importing/Exporting Personal Folder Data.
<P>
Use the following steps to back up the entire Personal Folder file:

<OL><P><LI>Close any mail-related programs such as Outlook, Microsoft Exchange,
   or Windows Messaging.

<P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control
   Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the Mail and Fax icon. If you do not have Microsoft Fax
   installed, you will see a Mail icon.

<P><LI>Click the Personal Folders service you want to back up. By default
   this service is called "Personal Folders", however, it may have been
   named something else. If the service has been named something else,
   you can determine what a service is by selecting the service from the
   list of services and clicking Properties. On the dialog box that
</OL>appears,
<PRE>   the title bar will say "Personal Folders" if the service is a Personal
   Folders service.  After reading the title bar, click Cancel. Use this
   method to check the type of any service you are unfamiliar with.

   You may have more than one Personal Folders service in your profile
   and if so, each set of personal folders must be backed up separately.

   If there are no Personal Folders services in your profile and you have
   been able to store information such as e-mail, contacts, or
   appointments in Outlook, then your information is most likely being
   stored in a mailbox on a Microsoft Exchange Server.  If this is the
   case, see the section titled, Backing Up Data When Using Outlook with
   Microsoft Exchange Server.

   If there are no personal folders in the list of services and you are
   not storing information in a Microsoft Exchange Server mailbox,
   Outlook can only be used for browsing files and the features in
   Outlook that store data can not be used.  If this is the case, there
   is no data to back up.

</PRE><P><LI>Click Properties and make a note of the path and file name listed in on
</OL>the
<PRE>   Properties dialog box.

   NOTE: You can possibly reduce the size of a Personal Folder file by
   clicking Compact Now. This is especially useful if you plan
   to back up the Personal Folder file to a floppy disk.

</PRE><P><LI>Click OK, then click OK again to close the Properties dialog box.

<P><LI>Make a copy of the file you noted is step 5 using the Windows 95
   Explorer or the My Computer icon. For more information on copying
   files in Windows 95, click the Start button, then click Help. On the
   Index tab, type "copying, files" to view the related topics.
<P>
</OL>If you ever need to restore a Personal Folder file, simply copy the backup
copy of the file you created with the above steps to the same folder and
name you noted in step 5.
<P>
<P><h3>Exporting Personal Folder Data</h3>
 
<P>
Use the following steps to export an individual folder such as Contacts
or Calendar to its own personal folder file:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, Click Import and Export.

<P><LI>Click "Export to a personal folder file", then click Next.

<P><LI>Click the folder you want to export and click Next.

<P><LI>In "Save exported file as", type the name of the file to
   which the data will be exported.

<P><LI>Click Finish.
<P>
</OL><h3>Importing Personal Folder Data</h3>
 
<P>
Use the following steps to import a personal folder file into Outlook:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, Click Import and Export.

<P><LI>Click "Import from a personal folder file", then click Next.

<P><LI>Type the path and name of the personal folder file you want to import,
   then click Next.

<P><LI>Click the folder into which the data will be imported.

<P><LI>Click Finish.
<P>
</OL><h3>Backing Up Data Using Outlook with Microsoft Exchange Server</h3>
 
<P>
If Outlook is being used with Microsoft Exchange Server you can choose to
have Outlook store information on the Microsoft Exchange Server or in a
set of Personal Folders on your hard drive. Use the following steps to
determine where Outlook currently stores its data:

<OL><P><LI>In Outlook, on the Tools menu, click Services.

<P><LI>Click the Delivery Tab.

<P><LI>Examine the "Deliver new mail to the following location" field.
   If the field contains the word "Mailbox" followed by an e-mail name,
   Outlook will store new e-mail, contacts, appointments, and such, in a
</OL>set
<PRE>   folders on the Exchange Server. If the field contains the words
   "Personal Folder" or another name of a set of personal folders, Outlook
   will store new e-mail, contacts, appointments, and such in the
   personal folders on your hard drive.

</PRE></OL>When Outlook information is stored on a Microsoft Exchange Server, it is
typically backed up at the server. For more information on backing up or
restoring information stored on an Microsoft Exchange Server, see your
Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator. If your information is being
stored in a set of Personal Folders on your hard drive and you want to back
up the data, see the section above titled Making a Back Up Copy of a
Personal Folder File.
