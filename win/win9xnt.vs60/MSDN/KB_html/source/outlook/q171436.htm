The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You receive an e-mail message in Microsoft Outlook 97 that you expect to
contain an attached graphic or other binary file, but instead contains
large amounts of encoded text.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when there is a mismatch in encoding types between
the sending e-mail client and the receiving e-mail client (Outlook).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To recover the attached file from the encoded text, use the appropriate
method for your situation.
<P>
<P><h3>Use a Different Encoding Method</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Have the sender change their attachment encoding method to Multipurpose
   Internet Mail Extensions (MIME), and resend the message. Internet mail
   gateways are more likely to handle MIME messages properly. Outlook
   supports the MIME standard.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>If the MIME option is not available to the sender, have them change
   their attachment encoding method to UUencode, and resend the message.
   UUencode is a common format used by UNIX and Macintosh mail systems.
   You can restore this file to a binary format using a third-
   party utility. See the "Third-Party Encoding and Decoding Utilities"
   section later in this article for a list of available utilities.
<P>
</UL><h3>Reintegrate a File with Multiple Parts</h3>
 
<P>
If the attached file was large, it may have been broken into multiple
messages, either by the sender or by an Internet mail gateway. If none of
the files are missing or out of sequence, copy and paste the text into a
single file. You can restore this file to a binary format using a third-
party utility. See the "Third-Party Encoding and Decoding Utilities"
section later in this article for a list of available utilities.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Several encoding methods exist to convert binary files into plain text.
This allows various file types to be sent over the Internet, and to be
exchanged between diverse operating systems. Because no single standard
exists for the encoding method, if the sender and receiver do not use the
same method, the attached file appears as encoded text instead of a fully
integrated file attachment.
<P>
The two major encoding methods are Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
(MIME) and UUencode. Files encoded with either of these methods generally
have information in the text header to identify the type.
<P>
The header of a MIME file contains the phrase: "MIME-version 1.0" or
"Base64."
<P>
The header of a UUencode file starts with the word "Begin," followed by a
three-digit number and the name of the encoded file. The body of a UUencode
file is a fixed width, usually 60 to 62 characters long. Each line begins
with a capital "M." The body ends with a line consisting of one space
character, and a trailer line consisting of the word "end."
<P>
