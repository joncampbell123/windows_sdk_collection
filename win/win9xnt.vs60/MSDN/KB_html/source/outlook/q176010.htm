The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When sending a message from Microsoft Outlook 97, the fields, From and
Received are blank in the sent copy of the message.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Your Inbox and Sent Items folders are in a Personal Folder (PST) resident
on your computer.  The e-mail server that receives the message for
distribution populates the From and Received fields, not the Outlook
client, so you have no way of seeing the fields after they are populated.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To see populated From and Received fields in a sent item message, you must
use Microsoft Exchange Server and designate your mail to be delivered to
the server Mailbox. In this case you are viewing the Sent Items resident on
the server or in an Offline Store (OST) file that is synchronized with the
server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
