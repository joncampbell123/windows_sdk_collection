<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Outlook 97, sent items may remain in your Outbox folder.
Because the items do not leave the Outbox, you will not receive responses
to messages, meeting requests, or task requests. In this situation, you
receive no warning that the items have not left your Outbox until you quit
Outlook. When you quit Outlook, you receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   There is still mail in your Outbox. Would you like to exit anyway?

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You are working offline and one of the following is true:

<UL><LI>You addressed the item to someone in your local Personal Address Book.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>You are using a Microsoft Exchange Service and addressed the item to
   someone in your synchronized Global Address List or synchronized Outlook
   Address Book Contacts.
<P>
</UL>In an offline state, Outlook cannot send the item because it does not have
access to the mail server. Because the addressee is available in one of
your local address lists, Outlook will validate the address; however,
Outlook will not provide an indication that the item remains unsent until
you quit Outlook.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Outlook will send the items the next time you make a connection to your
mail server by either working online or making a remote mail connection. To
make a remote mail connection while offline, on the Tools menu, click
"Check for New Mail."
<P>
