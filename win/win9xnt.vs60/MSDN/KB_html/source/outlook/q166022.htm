</UL><h3>Improved Security</h3>
 
<P>
This version of Outlook improves security by preventing potentially
malicious attachments and VBScript code from running without your
knowledge. For a summary of specific security enhancements, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   Article-ID:   <B><A href="../outlook/q166023.htm">Q166023</A></B>
   Title     :   OL97: Outlook 8.02 Security Improvements

</PRE><h3>Improved Handling of Macintosh File Attachments</h3>
 
<P>
This release improves how Outlook handles Macintosh file attachments.
Improvements in this release include fixes for the following issues:

<UL><LI>If you send an attached file from Microsoft Exchange for the Macintosh
   to Outlook, the attached file icon may change to the generic Windows
   icon (white page with Windows flag). Some Macintosh icons lose their
   properties when opened in Outlook.

<LI>If you use Outlook to forward a message to an Exchange for the
   Macintosh client and the message contains a Macintosh binary file
   attachment, the attached file loses its resource fork and is unusable.

<LI>If you drag a Macintosh file attachment from one Outlook message to
   another or into another Outlook, Messaging Application Programming
   Interface, (MAPI) folder, the attached file becomes unusable.

<LI>You may not be able to open a message file attachment previously saved
   by Outlook.
<P>
</UL>For additional information about fixed issues with Macintosh attachments,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   Article-ID:   <B><A href="../outlook/q165115.htm">Q165115</A></B>
   Title     :   OL97: Outlook Problems Handling Macintosh File
                 Attachments

</PRE><h3>Improved Handling of Attachments</h3>
 
<P>
Outlook now handles downloading file attachments more efficiently. If an
attachment did not have an icon property, earlier versions of Outlook
attempted to download the entire attachment on opening the item, looking
for an icon bitmap. Now Outlook simply displays a plain icon, and the
attachment is not downloaded until you double-click to open the attachment.
<P>
If you try to save a message that contains an attachment that you copied or
dragged from another message, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Operation failed.

</PRE>This issue is now fixed. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   Article-ID: <B><A href="../outlook/q168623.htm">Q168623</A></B>
   Title     : OL97 ErrMsg: Operation Failed Saving Message with
               Attachment

</PRE>When forwarding mail that contains several attachments from a PC Mail
postoffice, the recipient may not be able to see all of the attachments.
The recipient may see a space where the attachment should appear. Dragging
what appears to be a space at the end of the message to another message may
cause one of the missing attachments to appear. Adding text to the end of
the message may also make the missing attachments appear. This problem is
fixed in Outlook 8.02.
<P>
<P><h3>Improved Nickname List</h3>
 
<P>
This version of Outlook enhances the nickname cache so the cache is less
likely to cause name resolution problems and you have more control over the
cache. For additional information, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   Article-ID:   <B><A href="../outlook/q168641.htm">Q168641</A></B>

   Title     :   OL97: New Nickname Features in Outlook 8.02

</PRE><h3>Setup Issues</h3>
 
<P>
The first time you run Setup, "Allow comma as address separator" is turned
off. If "Allow comma as address separator" is turned off, and the Microsoft
Exchange Server Service is not in the profile, Setup turns on "Allow comma
as address separator." In all other cases, Setup does not change this
setting.
<P>
When installing standalone Outlook 97 with Regional Settings of English
(British) or English (Australian), you do not get an option to choose paper
format or proofing dictionary. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

please see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Title-ID  : OL97: How to Customize Outlook Calendar Holidays

</PRE>NOTE: <B><A href="../outlook/q161587.htm">Q161587</A></B> documents that Thanksgiving Day is incorrect in the United
States section of the holiday file; it is scheduled for Wednesday rather
than Thursday. Outlook 8.02 shows Thanksgiving on the correct day of the
week.
<P>
<P><h3>Calendar and Scheduling Issues</h3>
 
<P>
If you run Outlook 97 with your Calendar minimized, the monthly calendar
may not display when you open the Calendar window. This problem is fixed in
Outlook 8.02. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   Article-ID: <B><A href="../outlook/q168621.htm">Q168621</A></B>
   Title     : OL97: Calendar Disappears in Second Window

</PRE>Outlook 8.02 improves handling of recurring meeting calculations. It
corrects a problem that occurs when someone deletes a single instance of a
recurring meeting and then later sends out a change to the recurring
meeting. Earlier versions of Outlook erroneously sent out a cancellation
for the change and the deleted instance.
<P>
If two different users of Microsoft Mail and Microsoft Schedule+, version
1.0, send overlapping meeting requests to an Outlook user, and the Outlook
user accepts the first meeting and declines the second one, the first
meeting is also deleted. In this example, the Outlook user is using the
Outlook Calendar folder, not Schedule+. This problem is fixed in Outlook
8.02.
<P>
The Item.Find VBScript command causes Outlook to hang when trying to find
an infinite recurring appointment exception. This problem is fixed in
Outlook 8.02.
<P>
If you use Schedule+ as your primary calendar, but also made entries in
your Outlook 97 calendar, people who view your calendar may see your
Outlook calendar entries instead of your Schedule+ calendar entries. This
problem is fixed in Outlook 8.02. For additional information, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Title     : OL97: Imported Fax Numbers May Not Work in Outlook

</PRE>When importing a .cal file from Schedule+ 1.0, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   An error has occurred in the SCHPLUS.SAM translator while trying to
   attach a translator.

   Unable to logon to Schedule+. Schedule+ may be busy exporting a file or
   waiting to synchronize with the host. Or if you have created a new
   profile you may need to run Schedule+ before importing the data.

</PRE>This problem is fixed in Outlook 8.02. For additional information about
Schedule+ 1.0 translator error messages, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Title     : OL97: Sam Translator Error Importing Schedule Plus File

</PRE><h3>Miscellaneous Error Messages</h3>
 
<P>
If you use the Find Items feature in Outlook 97 and you press ALT+I to
change the focus to the Messages In list, Outlook may stop responding.
This problem is fixed in Outlook 8.02. For additional information, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   Article-ID: <B><A href="../outlook/q168587.htm">Q168587</A></B>
   Title     : OL97: ALT+I in Find Items Causes Outlook to Stop Responding

</PRE>When you attempt to open the Outlook 97 Notes, Messaging Application
Programming Interface (MAPI) folder, you may receive an invalid page fault
(IPF) error message or your system may stop responding. This problem is
fixed in Outlook 8.02. For additional information on this topic, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   Article-ID: <B><A href="../outlook/q169167.htm">Q169167</A></B>
   Title     : OL97: Invalid Page Fault Opening Outlook Notes MAPI Folder

</PRE>When you switch between some Outlook folders (for example, Deleted Items,
Contacts, Calendar, or Tasks), Outlook my cause an IPF in module MSO97.DLL.
This problem occurred with Outlook running on Windows 95 with beta versions
of Microsoft Internet Explorer, version 4.0. This problem is fixed in
Outlook 8.02.
<P>
<P><h3>Miscellaneous Improvements and Fixes</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word as Your E-mail Editor:
<P>
During Outlook Setup, you no longer receive a prompt to use Word as your
e-mail editor. This option has been removed from Outlook Setup; however,
Outlook still provides the option to use Word as your e-mail editor.
<P>
"Use Word as the E-mail Editor" is added to the Tools menu. "Use Microsoft
Word as the E-mail Editor" is still located on the E-mail tab in the
Options dialog box. If you select the "Use Microsoft Word as the e-mail
editor" check box, and if your computer has less than 32 megabytes of RAM,
you will receive the following alert:
<P>
<PRE>   This allows you to take advantage of the features of Word when you read
   and write e-mail. To use this 16MB is required, with 32MB recommended
   for best performance. Do you want to turn this on?

</PRE>Detection of TAPI Devices:
<P>
If your computer has multiple Telephony Application Programming Interface
(TAPI) devices installed, Outlook 97 may not properly list each device. For
example, Outlook may indicate that an ISDN modem is capable of voice
communications but cannot handle data, or that your fax/modem is not
present. This problem is fixed in Outlook 8.02. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   Article-ID: <B><A href="../outlook/q164247.htm">Q164247</A></B>
   Title     : OL97: Outlook Does Not Correctly Show All TAPI Devices

</PRE>Fields Offset by One Character:
<P>
After upgrading to Outlook 8.01, some fields appear to be offset by one
character. For example, this anomaly appears in the Contacts "File As"
field and the Appointment "Location" field. This problem does not affect
program operations, such as sorting, grouping, and so on, and it is fixed
in Outlook 8.02. For additional information, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE>   Article-ID: <B><A href="../outlook/q165412.htm">Q165412</A></B>
   Title     : OL97: Some Outlook Fields Are Offset by One Character

</PRE>VBScript 32 KB Limit:
<P>
When you type a large number of lines of code into the Visual Basic Script
Editor in Outlook 97, you eventually cannot type any more characters; the
Editor does not accept the keystrokes. This problem is fixed in Outlook
8.02. For additional information, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   Article-ID: <B><A href="../outlook/q166262.htm">Q166262</A></B>

   Title     : OL97: Outlook VBScript Editor Patch Available on MSL

</PRE>Spelling Checker Does Not Check Subject:
<P>
The spelling checker in Outlook 97 does not check the spelling of words in
the Subject line of an e-mail message. This issue is fixed in Outlook 8.02.
For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Title     : OL97: Spelling Checker Does Not Check Words in the Subject
               Line

</PRE>Improvements in MAILTO URL Handling:
<P>
If you click a mailto Uniform Resource Locator (URL) in the body of an
e-mail message in Outlook 97, a new, untitled e-mail message starts. The
new message is automatically addressed to the recipient indicated in the
mailto, but none of the other fields in the message header are completed.
Outlook 8.02 now supports the following additional mailto fields:
<P>
<PRE>   mailto:someone@microsoft.com

   mailto: someone@microsoft.com?subject=Subject of Message

   mailto: someone@microsoft.com?subject=Subject of Message&amp;cc=others@
   microsoft.com

   mailto: someone@microsoft.com;someone1@microsoft.com?subject=Subject of
   Message

   Title     : OL97: MAILTO: URL Handling Includes E-mail Address Only

</PRE>Forms Fix Utility:
<P>
The Forms Fix utility (previously distributed separately) is included as
part of Outlook 8.02. This utility is for users of Outlook 97 and the
Microsoft Exchange Client who need to switch between the two e-mail
clients. This utility substantially improves e-mail client performance for
users who install Outlook, but continue to use the Microsoft Exchange
client for e-mail. It produces improved performance by automatically
switching to the correct forms registration, based on your current e-mail
client.

   Title     : OL97: E-mail Forms Fix Utility

</PRE>Delegate Permissions Show as Custom:
<P>
Using Outlook 8.01, if you set up a delegate on a Microsoft Exchange Server
and assign any permissions except "none," the permissions show up as
"custom." This problem is unique to delegate permissions on a Microsoft
Exchange Server mailbox. This problem is fixed in Outlook 8.02.
<P>
Update Programs:
<P>
The Microsoft Exchange SP1 distribution uses the files update.exe and
adminupd.exe to update the existing Outlook 8.01 program to 8.02.
Adminupd.exe is used to update an Outlook 8.01 Client Install Point.
<P>
<P><h3>Readme Items</h3>
