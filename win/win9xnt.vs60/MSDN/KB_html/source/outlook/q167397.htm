The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It is often necessary to have multiple users log on to the same computer or
have a roaming user log on to different workstations on the network. In
each of these cases, it is preferable that users access their own Microsoft
Outlook 97 settings.
<P>
This article describes how to setup Outlook, to have multiple computer
users  or in the case of Windows NT, roaming workstation users if Windows
NT is setup for roaming profiles.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The files that store Outlook settings are normally located in the default
Windows directory. These files are:

<UL><LI>Views.dat - stores name space views

<LI>Outlprnt - stores print style settings

<LI>&lt;profile name&gt;.fav - stores Outlook Bar settings

<LI>&lt;profile name&gt;.rtf - stores AutoSignature information
<P>
</UL>You can move these files to a unique location for each user and change the
Windows Registry settings to point to them for any user who uses the
computer.
<P>
Because of a problem with current versions of Outlook, &lt;profile name&gt;.RTF
does not travel with a roaming user. If two roaming users have the same
profile name, an erroneous AutoSignature could be sent. If a roaming user
travels to a computer that does not have an RTF file that matches his
profile name, he will not get an autosignature when he expects one.
<P>
For Multiple Users, locate the first 3 of the above four files in a
separate directory for each user.
<P>
For Roaming Users, locate the first 3 of the four files in a server-based,
private user directory. Then, if Windows NT is setup for Roaming Profiles
(see REFERENCES section below), these files will be available from anywhere
the user logs on to the network.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Change the Registry Settings</h3>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should make a backup copy of the registry files before you edit the
registry.
