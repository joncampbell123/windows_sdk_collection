<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you attempt to print your Outlook 97 Contacts using the Card or Booklet
print style, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Outlook caused an Invalid Page Fault in Brmflt.drv.

      or

   Microsoft Outlook caused an Invalid Page Fault in Brmc.drv.

      Or

   Microsoft Outlook caused an Invalid Page Fault in Brohl96A.drv

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs when Outlook sends the printing information to your
Brother Multi-Functional Center printer driver. The Brother Multi-Function
Center comes in several models, which include the functions of a fax,
printer, copier, scanner, and PC fax, all in one machine. Capabilities vary
with each model.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Possible resolutions:

<UL><LI>You may be able to avoid this error by printing your Contacts using
   the Memo or Phone Directory print style.

<LI>Contact Brother Industries Ltd. at (800) 276-7746 to determine if
   there is an update to your printer driver.

<LI>Check your printer manual to determine if your printer can emulate
   another printer. If so, install that driver to print these formats.
   If you cannot determine your printer's emulation capabilities, try
   one of the HP LaserJet II drivers.
<P>
</UL>Brother Multi-Function Centers are manufactured by Brother Industries Ltd.,
a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
otherwise, regarding this product's performance or reliability.
