The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to Copy or Cut and Paste mail messages, tasks,
appointments, contacts, journal entries, or notes, between sessions of
Outlook 97, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The messaging interface has returned an unknown error. If the problem
   persists, start Outlook again.

</PRE>In the above situation, each session of Outlook uses a different profile.
<P>
NOTE: This same error message may be cause by a corrupted or damaged user
profile. In this case, the solution is to recreate the profile.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
There are two ways to workaround this problem. First, you can export the
data from one Outlook profile in a format that you can import into another
Outlook profile. A limitation of this method is that you must export an
entire folder at a time; however, you can filter the folder items you
export.
<P>
Second, you can include both information stores (Personal Folders or
Mailbox Folders) in the same profile and use the Copy to Folder or Move to
Folder command to copy or move the information from one information store
to another. Using this method, you can also drag items from one information
store to another since both are in the same profile.
<P>
You may not be able to use the second method if both information stores are
located on the server (for example in two different Exchange Mailbox
folders) because you may not be able to include multiple services of the
same type in one profile. Because the number of attached Personal Folders
(*.pst) in one profile is unlimited, the second method is usually a good
means of sharing information between profiles.
<P>
<P><h3>Export Outlook Items to Another Outlook Profile</h3>
 
<P>
Follow these steps to export Outlook items from one profile to a file and
import that file into a second Outlook profile:

<OL><P><LI>Start Outlook using the profile from which you want to copy.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Import and Export to start the Import
    and Export Wizard.

<P><LI>In the "Choose an action to perform" list, click "Export to
    a personal folder file (.PST)" and then click Next.

<P><LI>In the "Select the folder to export from" list, click a
    folder and then click Next.
<P>
    NOTE: At this point, you can filter items for export based on specific
    criteria. Click Filter in this dialog box to select filtering
    criteria.

<P><LI>In the "Save Exported file as" box, type the path and file name of the
    destination file.

<P><LI>Click Finish and exit Outlook.

<P><LI>Start Outlook using the second profile.

<P><LI>From the File menu, click Import and Export to start the Import
    and Export Wizard.

<P><LI>Under the "Choose an action to perform" list, click to select "Import
    from a personal folder file (.PST)" and then click Next.
<P>
 10. In the "File to import" box, type the path and file name of the file
     that you saved in step 5, above and click Next.
<P>
 11. In the "Select the folder to import form" list, click to select the
     folder from which to import and then click Finish.
<P>
    NOTE: This dialog box also provides options for filtering the items
    you import.
<P>
</OL><h3>Attach a Personal Folders File to Another Outlook Profile</h3>
 
<P>
Follow these steps to attach a Personal Folders file from one Outlook
profile to another Outlook profile:

<OL><P><LI>Exit and Log Off from Outlook.

<P><LI>Click the Start button point to Settings and then click Control Panel

<P><LI>Double-click Mail (or Mail &amp; Fax) and click Show Profiles.

<P><LI>In "The following profiles are set up on this computer" list, click the
   profile you want to add the local mail store to, click
   Properties, and then click Add.

<P><LI>In the "Available information services" list, click the type of service
   you want to add, typically this is the Personal Folders (.pst)
   you want to copy from, and click OK.

<P><LI>In the "Create/Open Personal Folders File" dialog, locate and click
   the local Personal Folders file that you want to copy from.

<P><LI>Click OK and then Close.

<P><LI>Start Outlook with the profile you just modified. In the Outlook
   folder List, you should see your original folders and the new Personal
   Folders you added to the profile.

<P><LI>Locate the items you want to Move or Copy and either drag them to the
   appropriate folder or use the Move or Copy command on the File
   menu.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook 97 for
Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Use the above workarounds in situations where you have two different
profiles for two different e-mail accounts. For example, you may use one
account for business and another one for personal use. Because of
differences in transport behavior, e-mailing items from one account to
another may not be a viable alternative to exporting and importing items or
sharing a Personal Folders (.pst) file between profiles.
