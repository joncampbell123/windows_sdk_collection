The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you log on to Microsoft Outlook 97 you may always get an Enter
Password dialog box that is not populated with the User Name or Domain
Name.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You are using the Microsoft Exchange Server service and there is no
Exchange key for this user profile in the Windows registry.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Modify the Windows registry to add the Exchange key for this user profile.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Domain Name and User Name that display in the Enter Password dialog box
are stored in a Windows registry entry called Exchange, in keys named
LogonDomain and UserName. Logging on to Outlook the first time builds and
populates these two keys, if the Exchange registry entry is present. If the
Exchange entry is not present, the domain and user information is not
stored and the Enter Password dialog box will always be completely
unpopulated.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
before you edit the registry.
<P>
<P><h3>Add the Exchange Entry to the Windows Registry</h3>
 
<P>
To modify the registry to resolve this problem follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Exit and Log Off.

<P><LI>Click Start on the Taskbar, and click Run.

<P><LI>In the Open window type REGEDIT and click OK.

<P><LI>Move to the following entry in the registry:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_USERS\&lt;UserName&gt;\Software\Microsoft
</PRE>
<P><LI>Right-click on the Microsoft entry, point to New and click Key.

<P><LI>Type the name "Exchange" (without the quotation marks) for the new
   key and press Enter.

<P><LI>Exit the Registry Editor.

<P><LI>Restart Outlook.

<P><LI>Type the User Name, Domain Name, and Password, in the blank Enter
   Password dialog box and then click OK.
<P>
</OL>RESULT: This builds the LogonDomain and UserName registry keys and
populates them with the values typed above. The next time Outlook starts
the Password dialog box is already populated with these values.
<P>
<P><h3>To Start Outlook without the Password Dialog Box</h3>
 
<P>
If you choose, you can store your password as well as the Domain Name and
User Name, so that the Enter Password dialog box is not presented at all by
following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Services.

<P><LI>Click the Microsoft Exchange Server service and click Properties.

<P><LI>On the Advanced tab, click to select "Use network security during
   logon."

<P><LI>Click OK and OK.
<P>
<P>
