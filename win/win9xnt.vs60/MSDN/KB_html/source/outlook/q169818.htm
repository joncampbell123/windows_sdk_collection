The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you initiate a phone call from a contact's record in Microsoft Outlook
97, Outlook records the call in the Journal folder. However, it may not
record the call on the Journal tab in contact's record.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are two possible causes for this:

<OL><P><LI>You have filed the contact under something other than the
   default names assigned to the "File As" field at setup.

<P><LI>You have entered "Name details" that include a first name containing
   a space.
<P>
</OL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve the behavior with the first cause, file the Contact by one of
the default names assigned to the File As field at setup.
<P>
To resolve the behavior with the second cause, do not type a first name
containing a space in the detail field.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Cause 1: The Contact is not Filed by a Default Name</h3>
 
<P>
When you set up a contact record, the system generates two File As field
names based on the contact's name as entered. Entering the contact's name
as "John B. Doe" generates names of "John B. Doe" and "Doe, John B." Using
either of these names in the File As, field results in logging phone calls
to the contact's Journal page. However, phone calls are not logged to the
contact's Journal page if you change the name in the File As field to
anything else.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Set Up a Contact Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Setup a new contact record.
<P>
   a. On the Contact menu, click New Contact.
<P>
   b. Type the name as "John B. Doe" (without the quotation marks), and
<P><PRE>      one phone number.
</PRE><P>
   c. On the Journal tab click to select, "Automatically record journal
<P><PRE>      entries for this contact."
</PRE><P>
   d. Click Save and Close.

<P><LI>Make a phone call to the contact.
<P>
   a. Open the contact just created above.
<P>
   b. On the contact toolbar, click the AutoDialer icon.
<P>
   c. Click Start Call.
<P>
   d. After dialing, end the call.
<P>
   e. Click Save and Close on the Phone Call record.
<P>
   f. Click Save and Close on the Contact record.

<P><LI>View the Journal entries.
<P>
   a. Open the Contact record.
<P>
   b. Click the Journal tab.
<P>
<P><PRE>      RESULTS: The phone call is recorded on the contact's Journal page.
</PRE><P>
   c. Click Save and Close on the Contact Record.
<P>
   d. Click the Journal folder.
<P>
   e. From the Current View window, click Phone Calls.
<P>
<P><PRE>      RESULTS: The phone call is recorded in the Journal folder.
</PRE><P>
</OL>In this example, the behavior is as expected. In the section, "Steps to
Reproduce the Problem," the contact name is changed and the problem
behavior occurs.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce the Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open the John B. Doe contact record created above.

<P><LI>In the File As window, type another name by which to file the record,
   such as, "Doctor Doe" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Click Save and Close.
<P>
</OL>Repeat steps 2 and 3 in the section, "Steps to Set Up a Contact Example."
The results show NO phone call entry recorded on the contact's Journal
page. However, there is a phone call entry in the Journal folder.
<P>
<P><h3>Cause 2: The First Name Contains a Space</h3>
 
<P>
When you set up a contact record and click Full Name, to enter the Name
details, entering only one name in each name field results in logging phone
calls correctly to the contact's Journal Page.
<P>
Example 1:
<P>
<PRE>   First:  John
   Middle: B.
   Last:   Doe

</PRE></OL>However, if you enter a First name containing a space, phone calls are NOT
logged to the contact's Journal page.
<P>
Example 2:
<P>
<PRE>   First:  John B.
   Middle:
   Last:   Doe

</PRE>NOTE: This condition sometimes results from importing Contact records from
another program.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce the Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Setup a new Contact record.
<P>
   a. On the Contact menu, click New Contact.
<P>
   b. Click Full name and type, "John B." (without the quotation marks)
<P><PRE>      in the First name field and "Doe" (without the quotation marks)
      in the Last name field (Example 2) and click OK.
</PRE><P>
   c. Enter one phone number and on the Journal tab click to select,
<P><PRE>      Automatically record journal entries for this contact.
</PRE><P>
   d. Click Save and Close.

<P><LI>Make a phone call to the contact as in step 2 of the section, "Steps to
   Set Up a Contact Example."

<P><LI>View the Journal entries.
<P>
   a. Open the contact record.
<P>
