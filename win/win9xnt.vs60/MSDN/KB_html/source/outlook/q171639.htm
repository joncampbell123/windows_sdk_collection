<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Accessing Public Folders with many items on a Microsoft Exchange Server
with Microsoft Outlook 97 is sometimes slow. This article suggests how to
improve the performance of Public Folder access.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Whenever a user creates a new View or changes the sort order for a given
Public Folder, Microsoft Exchange Server creates indices to the folder.
Creating a new view for the first time can take several minutes in a folder
with a large number of items.
<P>
Because many indices can be created by many users, they are not kept
permanently. Instead, the server maintains a temporary cache of views and
indices. By default, the system deletes those not used for eight days. If
your view is "aged out" due to lack of use, then the next time you open it,
you are likely to have to wait while the system creates a new index.
<P>
To improve performance of Public Folders, try the following:

<UL><LI>If possible, create the Folder Views you will need when the number of
   items in the folder is small. This reduces the time to create the
   original index.

<LI>Use your views to access the Public Folders at least as frequently
   as the default aging parameter. If the aging value is the eight-day
   default, access them at least weekly.

<LI>If feasible, have the Server Administrator increase the view-aging
   parameters in the registry. See the "References" section for
   instructions about how to do so.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: These improvement techniques do not apply when running off-line, as
the multiple server indices are not available to you. The Outlook client
only supports one index at a time so changing views off-line may be slow
with large item volumes.
