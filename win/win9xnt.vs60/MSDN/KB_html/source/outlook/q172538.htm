The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When using the Meeting Planner in Microsoft Outlook, you can invite others
to a meeting by sending meeting requests that are automatically processed
and placed on the attendees' calendars. Outlook does not have a feature
that enables you to send a cancellation request that automatically removes
a meeting appointment from the attendees' calendars.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this, use either of the following methods:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
To cancel the meeting and then recreate the meeting without inviting any of
the previous attendees you don't want to attend the meeting, use the
following steps.

<OL><P><LI>In Outlook, click Calendar.

<P><LI>Click the meeting you organized.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Open.

<P><LI>On the Appointment menu, click Cancel Meeting.

<P><LI>Use the Meeting Planner to recreate the meeting the same way you
   created the original meeting, however, this time invite only those you
   want to attend.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Create a custom solution for meeting requests that enables you to delete a
meeting from another user's calendar.

</PRE></OL>The following Visual Basic for Applications automation code can be used to
delete a meeting from another user's calendar. The sample code deletes a
meeting for January 1, 1997 at 9:00 AM from the calendar of a user named
johndoe.
