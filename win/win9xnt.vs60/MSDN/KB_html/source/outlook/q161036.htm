<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When designing a form in Microsoft Outlook 97, the option to "Always use
Microsoft Word as the e-mail editor" is unavailable or dimmed. This option
is located on the Properties tab and is only available when the new form is
based on a Message or Post note. It is unavailable if the form is based on
any of the other Outlook modules, such as an Appointment, Task, Task
Request, Contact, or Journal item.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Significant editing features, such as those that are available with Word,
are not usually necessary in items other than the Message or Post notes.
For example, when entering a contact using the contact form, almost all of
the information is entered into fields (name, address, telephone numbers,
and so on). Therefore, there is no need to have Word as the e-mail editor
in contact forms.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Checking this option sets Microsoft Word as the editor for the "message"
part of the form. Because the Message and Post notes are the built-in forms
that would most often benefit from the additional features of Word, the
option is available only to those forms.
