The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you type a date that has passed in Microsoft Outlook 97, the date may
show up on the wrong day of the week. For example, if you type 6/13/47 (a
Friday) into a Date field that displays the day of the week, the result is
Thursday.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Outlook is evaluating the "47" portion of the date as 2047, not 1947. The
weekdays for 6/13/1947 and 6/13/2047 are different. Many date formats use
only two digits; therefore, you may not receive the results you expect. In
this example, Outlook uses the year 2047.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you type a two-digit date in some Outlook fields, Outlook applies an
internal calculation to see if the date is more than 30 years in the past.
If the date is more than 30 years in the past, Outlook interprets the two-
digit date as 20XX instead of 19XX. Outlook makes its internal calculation
based on the first day of the current month and year that is set for your
computer.
<P>
For example, if the current date for your computer is 12/17/1996 and you
enter the date 1/1/60 into a date field, Outlook subtracts 1/1/60 from
12/1/1996. Because the difference is more than 30 years, Outlook uses the
date 1/1/2060 for the field.
<P>
NOTE: Not all Outlook Date fields use this internal calculation. Some
fields, such as Birthday and Anniversary fields, do not apply the
calculation and always evaluate two digit years as if they were in the
past.
<P>
To see the 30-year behavior, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Outlook Bar, click Tasks to open your Tasks folder.

<P><LI>On the Task menu, click New Task to open a new untitled task.

<P><LI>Under Due date, click to select the Due button.

<P><LI>In the Due box, type 1/1/50.

<P><LI>Click the arrow to the right of the Due box.

<P><LI>Note that the Calendar Picker reflects the year 2050.
<P>
</OL><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about setting task due dates, type "How do I set the
task due date?" in the Office Assistant, click Search, and then click to
view "Change the due date for a task."
