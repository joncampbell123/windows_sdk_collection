The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Outlook 97 Rules Wizard is a messaging manager add-in for
Outlook. With it you can define instructions for performing actions on
incoming and outgoing mail messages.
<P>
This article discusses:

<UL><LI>Installing the Rules Wizard

<LI>Converting the Inbox Assistant Rules

<LI>Creating Rules

<LI>How Rules are Applied

<LI>Running Rules on the Microsoft Exchange Server
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Rules Wizard uses an systematic process to guide you through the rule
creation process. For example, you can use the Rules Wizard to:

<UL><LI>Assign Categories to incoming or outgoing messages based on their
   contents.

<LI>Set a notification such as a message box or sound, when important
   messages arrive.

<LI>Move messages to a folder based on the sender.

<LI>Delete messages in a conversation.

<LI>Flag messages from a specified sender.

<LI>Delay delivery of messages by a specified amount of time.
<P>
</UL><h3>Installing the Rules Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
To download the Rules Wizard Add-in for Outlook, on the Help menu, point to
"Microsoft on the Web," and click Free Stuff. Or use your Internet browser
to access the Microsoft Web page at the following address:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/outlook/enhancements/ruleswiz.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/outlook/enhancements/ruleswiz.asp</A></B>

</PRE><h3>Converting the Inbox Assistant Rules</h3>
 
<P>
When you first start the Rules Wizard, you are prompted to convert all
Inbox Assistant Rules to Rules Wizard rules. Click to select Yes and then
click OK to convert all Inbox Assistant rules except any rule containing
conditions based on a custom form; these will have to be recreated.
<P>
If you have a large number of rules and you use Microsoft Exchange Server
4.0, you may not be able to convert all of your rules. This is because the
Rules Wizard disables and keeps the old Inbox Assistant rules and saves the
newly converted rules back to the server. The combination of Inbox
Assistant rules and Rules Wizard rules may take up more space than is
available on the server. For information on solving this problem, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. Click New.

</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. In the "Apply rules in the following order:" window, click the rule
       you want to copy and then click Copy.

</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. On the Tools menu click, Create Rule.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    c. The Rules Wizard is already populated with basic information from
       the message. Follow the instructions in the Rules Wizard
       to modify the conditions as necessary.
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>How Rules Are Applied</h3>
 
<P>
When you create a rule you designate whether to apply it when messages
arrive in the Inbox or when you send messages.
<P>
Rules are applied in the order in which they appear in the "Apply rules in
the following order:" window in the Rules Wizard. You can move rules up or
down in the list by clicking to select a rule then clicking Move up, or
Move down.
<P>
<P><h3>Running Rules on Microsoft Exchange Server</h3>
 
<P>
If you use Microsoft Exchange Server, the rules are stored on both your
computer and the server. If a rule can be completed on the server, it will
run even if Outlook is not running on your computer. However, if it
requires client-based activity, like moving a message to a folder in a
Personal Folders file, the rule is applied when you start Outlook.
<P>
Outlook tries to update all rules on the server. Rules that cannot be
updated are marked "client only" at the end of their name. If your list
contains rules that have been updated on the server and rules that have
not, the rules on the server are applied first, then the "client only"
rules.
<P>
NOTE: Outlook does not track meeting invitation responses, task assignment
responses, and voting responses if these messages have been moved from the
Inbox to another folder by a rule.
