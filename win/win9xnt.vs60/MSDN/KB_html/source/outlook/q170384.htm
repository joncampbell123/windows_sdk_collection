<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Outlook 97 Internet Mail Enhancement Patch (IMEP), does not
automatically call your Internet Service Provider (ISP) using dial-up
networking to check for new mail. This article describes how to set up IMEP
to connect automatically to your ISP at a regular interval to check for new
mail. The Imepread.txt file that ships with IMEP also documents these
steps; however, the steps in that text are written for IE4 users. The steps
in this article describe the dialogs and settings for IE 3.02 users.
<P>
Note: The IMEP can be downloaded from the Microsoft Web site at:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/office97/servicerelease/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/office/office97/servicerelease/default.htm</A></B>

</PRE>It is also available in Microsoft Office 97 Service Release 1 Patch (SR-1
Patch) and Microsoft Office 97 Service Release 1 Enterprise Update (SR-1
Ent Upd).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: This issue should not arise when using Microsoft Windows NT. These
steps do not work if you are using Outlook with the Windows NT operating
system. The Microsoft Dial-Up Networking 1.2 Upgrade described in this
article is designed for Windows 95 and not Windows NT. These steps do not
work if you are using Outlook with the Windows NT operating system, and may
cause damage to your dial-up networking if you perform them in Windows NT.
<P>
The steps described in this article will set up Outlook and IMEP to do the
following:

<UL><LI>When you start Outlook it immediately dials your ISP and checks mail.

<LI>After a three minute idle time your dial-up connection disconnects.

<LI>At an interval you set, Outlook automatically dials your ISP and checks
   mail.

<LI>If Outlook is not connected to your ISP and you send a mail message,
   Outlook immediately connects to your ISP and sends the message.
<P>
</UL>Setting up IMEP to connect automatically to your ISP at a regular interval
is a five part process.

<UL><LI>Install the Microsoft Dial-Up Networking 1.2 Upgrade
<LI>Set your e-mail connection type to LAN
<LI>Configure your connection to disconnect if idle
<LI>Configure your Dial-Up connection
<LI>Set the Dial-Up interval
<P>
