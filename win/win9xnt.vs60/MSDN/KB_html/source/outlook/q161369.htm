The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you try to use the Timex Data Link series 100 watch with the Microsoft
Outlook 97 Timex Data Link Watch Wizard, the wizard may not communicate or
calibrate with the watch.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Timex Data Link Watch Wizard, which exports Outlook information to the
Timex Data Link Watch, does not work with the series 100 watch and Windows
NT version 3.51 or 4.0.
<P>
The Timex Data Link series 100 watch only calibrates using the "CRT
Mode 2 - Unframed" output type, which is not available with Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use one of the following methods to export Outlook data to a Timex Data
Link watch:
<P>
- Use the Timex Data Link series 150 watch and the Timex Data Link Watch
<PRE>  Wizard with Windows 95 or Windows NT. Only if the default communication
  settings fail, use the steps below to calibrate the wizard with your
  watch.

</PRE>- Use the Timex Data Link series 100 watch and the Timex Data Link Watch
<PRE>  Wizard with Windows 95. If you choose this method, use the steps below to
  calibrate the wizard with your watch and set the output type to
  "CRT Mode 2 - Unframed" and the device type to "Timex Data Link Watch."

</PRE>- Use the optional Timex Notebook Adapter. For more information about this
<PRE>  device, visit the Timex Web site at the following Web address:

  <B><A href="http://www.timex.com/datalink/2index.html">http://www.timex.com/datalink/2index.html</A></B>

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To calibrate the Timex Data Link Wizard with the Timex Data Link series 100
or 150 watch, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Outlook File menu, click Import And Export to open the Import
   And Export Wizard.

<P><LI>In the "Choose an action to perform" list, click "Export to Data
   Link watch."

<P><LI>Click Next to open the Timex Data Link Watch Wizard.

<P><LI>Click "Setup and Calibrate" to open the Advanced Settings dialog box.

<P><LI>In the "Device Type" list, select the appropriate type of watch.

<P><LI>In the "Output Type" list, select the appropriate CRT Mode.
<P>
   For Windows 95:
<P>
   First, try to send data with Mode 2, and then move down the list.
   The modes are listed in the order of most reliable to least reliable.
   Only Mode 2 works with the series 100 watch.
<P>
   For Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT Server:
<P>
   Mode 2 does not work with this operating system, so you cannot calibrate
   a series 100 watch. Mode 3 provides the fastest transmission. Mode 4 is
   slightly faster than Mode 5. Mode 5 is the slowest mode, but the most
   reliable on this operating system.

<P><LI>To automatically calibrate your system for the output type you selected
   above, place your watch in COMM READY mode, and then click Setup.
<P>
   To verify the automatic calibration or to manually calibrate your
   system, place your watch in COMM READY mode, and then click Test. If you
   use Windows NT Workstation, perform the calibration manually.
