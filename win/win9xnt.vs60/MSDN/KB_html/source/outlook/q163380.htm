<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how you can set your Microsoft Outlook 97 Microsoft
Fax service to dial telephone numbers within your area code as if they are
long-distance.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you set up the Microsoft Fax service within Windows, you specify your
dialing location. By default, the Microsoft Fax service dials any telephone
number within your area code as a local telephone number and any telephone
number outside of your area code as a long-distance telephone number.
<P>
In some areas of the country your telephone service may require you to dial
certain numbers within your area code as long-distance telephone numbers,
including 1+(area code) prior to the last seven digits. You can use several
methods to set up your Microsoft Fax service to dial certain telephone
numbers within your area code as long-distance telephone numbers.
<P>
<P><h3>Outlook</h3>
