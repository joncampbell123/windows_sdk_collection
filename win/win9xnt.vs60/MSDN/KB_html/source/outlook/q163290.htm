The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder (directory).
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to troubleshoot connectivity problems when you
are using Microsoft Outlook 97 with a Lotus cc:Mail postoffice.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Cc:Mail has two postoffice versions: version 2.x, and version 6.x. Some
users refer to these versions as DB6 and DB8 postoffices. Outlook supports
the version 2.x (DB6) postoffice. Although Outlook does not support the
cc:Mail version 6.x postoffice (DB8), you might have success using the
troubleshooting steps in this article to configure version 6.x with
Outlook. If you are using a version 6.x postoffice and these steps do not
work, you should contact Lotus Development Corporation for further
information.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Configure a cc:Mail Profile</h3>
 
<P>
Install the cc:Mail information service from the \Valupack\Ccmail folder
(directory) on the Microsoft Office 97 compact disc. The ccmailsp.exe file
is for Microsoft Windows 95 and Microsoft Windows NT, version 4.0, and the
ccmailnt.exe file is for Microsoft Windows NT, version 3.51.
<P>
After you install the cc:Mail information service, map a drive to the
cc:Mail server and configure a profile that includes the cc:Mail
information service.
<P>
Provide postoffice information, logon name, and password. By default, the
postoffice is the \Ccdata folder. Your mail administrator can create
this folder using a different name; contact your administrator if you
are not sure of the postoffice folder name.
<P>
During installation of the service, you may receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to find cc:Mail program directory. Do you want to find it
   now or work offline?

</PRE>Choose Find It Now, and specify the location of the program files. By
default, this folder is either \Ccmail or \Lotapps\Ccmail.
<P>
Complete the profile information and start Outlook.
<P>
<P><h3>Troubleshooting Errors Starting Outlook</h3>
 
<P>
When you start Outlook, you may receive one of the following error
messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not find the cc:Mail postoffice. Would you like to change it now?
   Yes - if you would like to view or change the path to your cc:Mail
   postoffice. No - if the postoffice is currently unavailable or if you
   do not want to change it, No - if you are currently working offline.

   -or-

   Unable to logon to cc:Mail using the information you have entered. The
   postoffice path, user name, and/or password that you specified may be
   incorrect. Would you like to correct it now? If you would like to
   correct it now, choose Yes.

</PRE>Follow these steps to troubleshoot these errors:

<OL><P><LI>Download the most current Vendor Independent Messaging (VIM) dll files
   from the Lotus Support File Library at:
<P>
<P><PRE>      <B>http://ftp.support.lotus.com/ftp/pub/comm/ccmail/dev_tools/</B>
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      or
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      <B>ftp://ftp.support.lotus.com/pub/comm/ccmail/dev_tools/</B>
</PRE><P>
   The zip file names are as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Vdlwin.zip for Win95 computers
      Vdlw32.zip for Windows NT computers
</PRE><P>
</OL>Unzip the Vdlwin.zip file to the \Windows\System\ folder in Windows95.
Unzip the VDlw32.zip file to the \Winnt\System32\ folder in Windows NT.
<P>
<PRE>   Version 6.x of the postoffice requires these files, and version 2.x
   runs best with them installed.

</PRE><P><LI>Verify the correct path to the cc:Mail Program files in the following
   registry key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Transend\Ccmsvc
</PRE>
<P><LI>Rename the following files and reinstall your cc:Mail transport:
<P>
<PRE>      Vimthk16.dll     Vimthk32.dll      Ccmab32.dll
      Ccmdlist.exe     Ccmsvc.cnt        Ccmsvc.hlp
      Ccmxp32.dll

</PRE></OL><h3>Configuration Errors</h3>
 
<P>
Once you can successfully start Outlook and check for new mail without
receiving any error, copy Export.exe and Import.exe from the mail server's
\Ccadmin folder to your \Windows\System folder. If you are setting
up with a cc:Mail version 6.x postoffice, you also need to copy the Ie.ri
file from the \Ccadmin folder to your \Windows\System folder.
<P>
If these files are not present or if you use the wrong version of these
files, you will receive the following error message when trying to use the
Outlook Tools cc:Mail Service Tools menu:
<P>
<PRE>   Configuration error: This system does not have the necessary resources
   to perform the requested import. See the software requirements section
   in cwimport.txt for more info.

</PRE>In this message, the cwimport.txt file name is incorrect. The correct file
name is Cwimport.ini. You must run the Export.exe on your computer, which
executes a batch file called exportrn.bat. That batch file creates the
c:\windows\cwimport.ini file referred to in the error message.
<P>
<P><h3>Reinstalling the Cc:Mail Transport</h3>
 
<P>
If these troubleshooting techniques do not work, or if you have already
completed a partial setup, follow these steps to reinstall the cc:Mail
transport:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>

Values Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before
you edit the registry.

<OL><P><LI>Use the Windows Registry Editor to delete the following keys:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Transend\Ccmsvc
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows Messaging Subsystem\
      Profiles\&lt;the name of your cc:Mail profile&gt;
</PRE>
<P><LI>Rename the following files and reinstall the cc:Mail transport from the
   Office 97 ValuPack:
<P>
<PRE>      Vimthk16.dll     Vimthk32.dll     Ccmab32.dll
      Ccmdlist.exe     Ccmsvc.cnt       Ccmsvc.hlp
      Ccmxp32.dll
