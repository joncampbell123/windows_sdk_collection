The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you password protect a personal folder, you may be prompted
for a password each time you open Microsoft Outlook 97.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The owner of the Personal folder will not be prompted for the password if
it was saved to the password list. Others who use the same computer will be
asked for a password.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The reason for password protecting a personal folder (PST) is to prevent
other users who also log onto the same computer from opening or viewing
your PST file. If you as the owner, log onto the computer, you are trusted
and will not be prompted for the password. Other users logging on to
the computer will receive a prompt for the password. Once the password
has been typed, the user will not be prompted for the password again until
Outlook is restarted.
<P>
For example, user A logs onto the computer and creates a mail profile that
includes a password-protected PST. If at a later time user B logs onto the
same computer and tries to open user A's PST they will be prompted for a
password. If User A logs onto the system, no prompt for a password to open
the PST will display unless the password is not in the password list.
<P>
If the owner of the PST file is prompted for a password, enter
the password then click to select "Save this password in your password
list."
<P>
If another user needs continual access to the PST file, you can allow them
access by typing the password, then clicking to select "Save this password
in your password list."
<P>
The owner can password protect a PST when it is created or at a later time.
When you add a personal folder to your mail profile, type the password
and click to select "Save this password in your password list."
<P>
<P><h3>To Protect Your PST After Creation</h3>
 
<P>
To protect an existing PST, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Services.

<P><LI>Click to select your personal folder, then click Properties.

<P><LI>Click Change Password.

<P><LI>Type the old password (if there was one) and type the new password,
   where indicated. Type the password again in Confirm Password.

<P><LI>If you do not want to be prompted for a password each time you start
   a new Outlook session, click to select "Save this password in your
   password list." Click OK, OK, and OK to close all open windows.
