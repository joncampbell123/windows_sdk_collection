The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When importing contacts from one Personal Folder File (.PST file) into
another, or when copying or moving contacts, any journal entries on a
contact's Journal tab are lost.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the contact is moved from one store to another, its internal
identification number changes. This causes the contact to lose the link
between it and the journal entry. Journal entries are not stored within the
contact, but in the Journal folder. Changing to the journal page of the
Contact does a lookup in the Journal folder to find matching journal
entries. Since the internal identification number has changed, the lookup
does not find anything.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Resolution #1 - Viewing the Journal Entries by Contact</h3>
 
<P>
As an alternative to viewing the contact's journal tab, you can view the
journal entries by contact in a tabular format and see the same information
available on the journal tab. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Outlook's Journal folder, click "Define Views" on the View menu.

<P><LI>In the "Define Views for Journal" dialog box, click "New."

<P><LI>Enter a name for the new view, click "Table" in the "Type of view"
   window and then click OK.

<P><LI>In the "View Summary" dialog box, click "Fields" to adjust the fields
   you want to see, click "Group BY" to group the entries by Contact, and
   then click OK.

<P><LI>Click "Apply View" to view the journal entries by contact.
<P>
</OL><h3>Resolution #2 - Adding Instead of Importing a PST File</h3>
 
<P>
While it is not possible to import, copy, or move contacts without the
journal entries associated with those contacts being lost. It is possible
to retain these journal entries by adding a Personal Folder file to a
profile instead of importing it.
<P>
Adding a Personal Folder file does not enable you to combine the contacts
from one Personal Folder file with another, and may not be a viable
solution. Adding a Personal Folder file will result in multiple Contacts
folders unless you remove any Personal Folder files you are not using. The
steps below describe how to add and remove Personal Folders files.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Add a Personal Folder File</h3>
 
<P>
To add a Personal Folder file do the following:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Services.

<P><LI>Click Add.

<P><LI>In the Available Information Services list, Click Personal Folders,
   and then click OK.

<P><LI>Select the .PST file from which you want to add.

<P><LI>Click Open, then click OK. The newly added Personal Folder file is now
   added to the list of folders. To view the list of folders, click Folder
   List on the View menu.
<P>
</OL><h3>Steps to Remove Personal Folder Files</h3>
 
<P>
Use the following steps to remove any unwanted Personal Folder files:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Services.

<P><LI>Select the Personal Folder service you want to remove.
<P>
   NOTE: To determine what .PST file a Personal Folder service is
   referencing, click Properties. The Path field will display the file
   name. After you have noted the file name, Click OK. If this is the
   Personal Folder service you want to remove, go to step 3; otherwise,
   select a different Personal Folder service and check its properties.

<P><LI>Click Remove and click Yes.

<P><LI>Click OK to close the Services dialog.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Import and Export.

<P><LI>Click "Import from a personal folder file", and then click Next.

<P><LI>Type the path and name of a personal folder file containing at least one
   contact with Journal entries, then click Next.

<P><LI>Click the folder into which the data will be imported.

<P><LI>Click Finish.

<P><LI>Open a contact that contained Journal entries and click the Journal tab.
<P>
   Results: All Journal entries are missing.
