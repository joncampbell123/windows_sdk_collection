</UL>The Internet Mail, Properties, Connection tab contains most of the settings
which enable you to control how you connect and transfer e-mail from your
Internet mailbox. Follow these steps to access the Internet Mail Connection
options:

<OL><P><LI>In Outlook, on the Tools menu, click Services.

<P><LI>Under the Services tab, click to select Internet Mail and click the
   Properties button to open the Internet Mail property dialog box.

<P><LI>Click the Connection tab to see your options for how you connect and
   transfer e-mail.
<P>
</OL><h2>Connecting To Internet Mail</h2>
 
<P>
The options in this area of the Internet Mail Properties Connection dialog
box determine how you connect to your mail server.
<P>
<P><h3>Connect Using the Network</h3>
 
<P>
This option connects your Internet mailbox through a local area network
(LAN) connection. If you connect using the network, you can retrieve,
compose, and send messages from your mailbox.
<P>
<P><h3>Connect Using the Modem</h3>
 
<P>
This option connects your Internet mailbox through Dial-Up Networking by a
remote access connection. If you have remote access, you use a modem to
connect to your mailbox during remote sessions. To schedule the dial-up
connection, clear the "Work Off-line and Use Remote Mail" check box, and
then click Schedule.
<P>
NOTE: To use this option, you must have installed Dial-Up Networking during
Microsoft Windows Setup or through Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel.
<P>
<PRE>   Dial Using the Following Connection
   -----------------------------------

   If you connect using a modem, type your dial-up connection, or click
   the arrow to choose from the list.

      Add Entry:

      This option adds more Dial-Up Networking connections to the list.

      Edit Entry:

      This option edits the existing Dial-up Networking connection
      properties.

      Login As:

      This option provides PPP user information.

</PRE></OL><h2>Transferring Internet Mail</h2>
 
<P>
These settings specify how Internet Mail transfers messages between your
Internet mailbox and Outlook.
<P>
<P><h3>Work Offline and Use Remote Mail</h3>
 
<P>
Click (check) this check box to initially display message headers. You can
then scan the headers (using Remote Mail, which is available from the Tools
menu in Microsoft Outlook) to mark the messages you want to receive, copy,
or delete. While using Remote Mail, you can compose messages and send them
to your Outbox at any time, and send and receive messages when you connect
to your mailbox. Clear this check box to deliver all messages from the mail
server.
<P>
If you make your Internet connection using an Internet Browser before
starting Outlook, and keep it running after quitting Outlook, do not choose
"Work off-line and use Remote Mail." In this instance, you deliver and send
mail using your existing connection by clicking "Check for New Mail" on the
Outlook Tools menu.
<P>
If you want Outlook to initiate your Internet connection and log off when
you quit Outlook, do not choose "Work off-line and use Remote Mail." When
you start Outlook and Outlook cannot detect an existing Internet
connection, Outlook will automatically initiate your connection logon. In
this instance, you deliver and send mail using your active connection by
clicking "Check for New Mail" on the Outlook Tools menu.
<P>
If you want to use Outlook in an off-line state and have a connection only
when your are delivering and sending mail, choose "Work off-line and use
Remote Mail." Outlook will not activate your Internet connection until you
select the Remote Mail Wizard. To activate Remote Mail from the Outlook
Tools menu, click Remote Mail. Remote Mail initiates your Internet
connection and hangs up when transfers are finished.
<P>
<PRE>   Schedule:

   The Schedule option is only available if you do not select to Work
   off-line and use Remote Mail. Click this option to set the time
   interval for message delivery and, if you connect using a modem, to set
   a schedule for dial-up connections.

   Log File:

   Click this option to create a file that records events during your mail
   sessions. A log file is useful for troubleshooting when you have
   problems with Internet Mail.
