   TITLE     : OL:97 How to Get the Latest Version of CompuServe Mail
               Service

</PRE><h2>General Configuration Troubleshooting</h2>
 
<P>
Outlook creates a default profile called Microsoft Outlook. Most users will
either add services to this profile or create a new profile with new
services. The first troubleshooting step for configuration issues is to
create a new profile that includes only the service with which you are
having problems. When this is working, you can add additional services,
checking each one.
<P>
NOTE: With respect to Mail services, you can only add one of each service
into a single profile. That is, you can not add two Internet Mail services,
or two MSN services into a single profile.  You can, however, add one
Internet Mail service, one MSN service, and one CompuServe Mail service
into a single profile.
<P>
You can create a new profile from the Mail And Fax icon in Control Panel or
from the Inbox property page. Under some system configurations, the Inbox
property is not available, so you must use Control Panel.
<P>
To create a new profile from Control Panel, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Windows Control Panel, double-click the Mail And Fax icon.
   (The icon is a Mail icon if you did not install fax services.)

<P><LI>Under the Services tab, click Show Profiles to list your profiles.

<P><LI>Click Add to open the Inbox Setup Wizard.

<P><LI>Check that the default is set to "Use the following information
   services."

<P><LI>Click to clear all services except the one you are troubleshooting.
   For troubleshooting purposes, add only one service at a time.

<P><LI>Click Next and in the Profile Name box, type a name for the new
   profile.

<P><LI>Follow the Inbox Setup Wizard prompts, answering the questions for your
   service until you finish.
<P>
</OL>Follow these steps to create a new profile from the Inbox:

<OL><P><LI>With the right mouse button, click the Inbox icon on the Windows
   Desktop to open the Inbox Properties.

<P><LI>Under the Services tab, click Show Profiles to list your profiles.

<P><LI>Click Add to open the Inbox Setup Wizard.

<P><LI>Check that the default is set to "Use the following information
   services."

<P><LI>Click to clear all services except the one you are troubleshooting.
   For troubleshooting purposes, add only one service at a time.

<P><LI>Click Next and in the Profile Name box, type a name for the new
   profile.

<P><LI>Follow the Inbox Setup Wizard prompts, answering the questions for your
   service until you finish.
<P>
</OL><h2>Internet Configurations</h2>
 
<P>
To troubleshoot Internet configurations, you must first establish that the
Internet connection is working properly.
<P>
<P><h3>Checking Your Internet Connection</h3>
 
<P>
To make sure your Internet connection is working properly, establish your
Internet connection and ping a known Internet Protocol (IP) address by
typing the following command at an MS-DOS prompt:
<P>
<PRE>   ping &lt;IP address&gt;

</PRE></OL>where &lt;IP address&gt; is a known IP address, such as the Microsoft FTP server
(198.105.232.1).
<P>
If you can ping a known IP address successfully, basic TCP/IP connectivity
is functioning properly. Next, try to ping the Microsoft FTP server using
"ftp.microsoft.com" instead of its IP address. At an MS-DOS prompt type the
following command:
<P>
<PRE>   ping ftp.microsoft.com

</PRE>If this works, your Domain Name Server (DNS) settings are functioning
properly.
<P>
A DNS server maintains a database for resolving host names and IP
addresses, allowing users of computers configured to query the DNS to
specify remote computers by friendly host names rather than IP addresses.
DNS domains are not the same as Windows NT networking domains.
<P>
For example, issuing the "ping ftp.microsoft.com" command goes to the DNS
server you specified for your internet connection, looks up the IP address
for the site, and then pings that IP address.
<P>
For more detailed information on connecting to the Internet see the
following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win95x/q138789.htm">Q138789</A></B>
      TITLE     : How to Connect to the Internet in Windows 95

</PRE><h3>Setting TCP/IP as Default Protocol</h3>
 
<P>
Once you know that your Internet connection is valid, you should check that
TCP/IP is set as the default protocol. Follow these steps to make sure that
TCP/IP is your default protocol:

<OL><P><LI>On the Windows Desktop, use your right mouse button to click Network
   Neighborhood.

<P><LI>Click properties to open the Network Properties.
<P>
   For Windows 95:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. Under the Configuration tab, click TCP/IP and click Properties to
       open the TCP/IP Properties.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. Click the Advanced tab, verify that the "Set this protocol to be the
       default protocol" check box is selected, and then click OK.
</PRE><P>
   For Windows NT:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. Click the Bindings tab
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. In the Show Binding For list, click All Services.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    c. Expand the list for all services and use the Move Up and Move Down
       buttons to position the TCP/IP protocol at the top of each list.
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: While you are in the TCP/IP Properties, you should verify that
   all Internet configuration information is correct. If you are in doubt
   about any setting, contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP).

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Other Internet Connection Issues</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Most Internet addresses and connection settings are case sensitive.
   Check for correct capitalization.

<LI>Make sure your profile does not include multiple services that require
   a modem connection. For example, Internet and fax services in the same
   profile may cause modem conflicts within Outlook.

<LI>Establish your Internet connection, and then start Outlook. If you
   receive an error trying to send or receive mail, confirm all of your
   Internet Mail settings with your Internet service provider. You may
   have entered a domain name server or news server address instead of the
   mail server.

<LI>Remote Mail configurations may cause unexpected results. If you
   configured a service for Remote Mail, you may lose connections,
   or mail may not be sent or received as expected.
<P>
</UL>For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../outlook/q161323.htm">Q161323</A></B>
   TITLE     : OL97: Undeliverable Mail Message When Sending Internet Mail

</PRE></OL><h2>Microsoft Mail Configurations</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Create a Test Postoffice</h3>
 
<P>
When troubleshooting Microsoft Mail problems, you must first determine if
Outlook or the MSMail Postoffice is the cause.  The easiest way to do this
is to create a test Postoffice.
<P>
To create a test Postoffice, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Microsoft Mail Post Office to open the
   Microsoft Workgroup Postoffice Admin Wizard.

<P><LI>Click Create a new Workgroup Postoffice.

<P><LI>In the Postoffice Location box, type a location to c:\ or a local
   drive and click Next.
<P>
   NOTE: By default the Admin Wizard creates a folder called wgpo0000.
   This folder derives its name from Work Group Post Office.

<P><LI>Confirm the location and click Next.

<P><LI>Fill in the Administrator Account Information and click OK.

<P><LI>This should complete the Postoffice creation. To add users, go back
   to Control Panel, Microsoft Mail Postoffice, and click to select
   "Administer an Existing Post Office."
<P>
</OL>Create a new profile with Microsoft Mail service and point to the test
Postoffice you just created. If this profile works, your original
Postoffice is the problem. Check with the original Postoffice administrator
to verify that the configuration information is correct.
<P>
<P><h3>Other Microsoft Mail Issues</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mail connection information is case sensitive. Check for
   correct capitalization.

<LI>Remote Mail configurations may cause unexpected results. If you
   configured a service for Remote Mail, then you may lose connections
   or mail may not send or receive as expected.
<P>
</UL>For more information about Remote Mail, type "remote mail" in the
Office Assistant, click Search, and then click to view "Use Remote Mail."
<P>
<P><h2>Exchange Server Configurations</h2>
 
<P>
Outlook ships with an Exchange client. You can use this program to
determine if your configuration problem is unique to Outlook. If the
problem persists under the Exchange client, you may have a server or
profile issue.
<P>
Locate the Exchng32.exe file in the \Program Files folder. The exact
location will vary depending on the operating system. By default,
Exchng32.exe is either in the Microsoft Exchange or the Windows Messaging
subfolder. The file size is 83,776 bytes with a date of 11/17/96. Start
Exchng32.exe with the same profile as you used with Outlook.
<P>
If your problem does not persist with the Exchange client, the problem may
be with Outlook or one of its associated files. You may have to remove and
re-install Outlook using the Add/Remove Programs icon in Control Panel.
<P>
If the problem continues with Exchng32.exe, you should suspect a server or
profile issue and use the following steps to continue troubleshooting:

<OL><P><LI>Resolve your mailbox name with the server by clicking the Check Names
   button in the properties sheet for Exchange Server.

<P><LI>If possible, configure a profile without the Exchange Server and
   see if the problem persists.

<P><LI>If possible, change the delivery location and see if the problem
   persists.
<P>
   NOTE: Before you change the delivery from a Mailbox location to a
   Personal Folder, make sure you move any existing mail messages from
   the Inbox folder.
<P>
</OL><h2>Lotus Notes</h2>
 
<P>
Outlook does not support Lotus Notes services.
<P>
For more information about transitioning from Lotus Notes to Outlook, type
"lotus notes" in the Office Assistant, click Search, and then click to view
"If you use Lotus Notes 4.0."
<P>
<P><h2>Lotus cc:Mail</h2>
 
<P>
Outlook provides Lotus cc:Mail service as part of the ValuPack on the
distribution compact disc for Office 97. Follow these steps to troubleshoot
cc:Mail configuration problems:

<OL><P><LI>Start by mapping a drive to your cc:Mail folder and creating a new
   cc:Mail only profile.

<P><LI>Re-install cc:Mail from the ValuPack. Outlook does not support the
   Lotus provided cc:Mail transport service; you must use the Microsoft
   provided cc:Mail transport service from the ValuPack.
<P>
   NOTE: If you use Windows NT Workstation 3.51 or Windows NT Workstation
   4.0, before adding the cc:Mail information service to your profile, you
   need to install the 32-bit version of Vendor Independent Messaging
   (VIM), available from Lotus support at IBM Corporation.
<P>
   For more information about installing the Lotus cc:Mail service,
   double-click to open the file Valupk8.hlp in the Microsoft Office 97
   ValuPack. Under the topic "What do you want to know about?",
   click "Lotus cc:Mail information service."

<P><LI>Verify with your cc:Mail administrator that your cc:Mail service
   properties are correct:
<P>
<P><PRE>    a. On the Outlook Tools menu, click Services to open the Services
       dialog box.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. Click Properties and check all settings under the Logon, Delivery,
       and Addressing tabs, as applicable.
</PRE><P>
</OL>For more information about Lotus cc:Mail, type "cc:Mail" in the Office
Assistant, click Search, and then click to view "If you use Lotus cc:Mail."
<P>
<P><h2>OnLine Services</h2>
 
<P>
The following additional services are configurable with Outlook: MSN and
CompuServe. Before you begin troubleshooting, make sure you can
establish a valid connection to the service. If your connection fails, you
should contact the service provider.
<P>
<P><h3>The Microsoft Network</h3>
 
<P>
When troubleshooting MSN configuration issues, make sure that your MSN
connection functions properly, without running Outlook. If you cannot
connect to MSN, contact MSN support. Outlook setup assumes you have
installed MSN and that your MSN connection works.
<P>
<P><h3>CompuServe</h3>
 
<P>
If the general troubleshooting steps at the beginning of this article fail,
you should contact CompuServe for help with your configuration settings.
Microsoft will support Outlook usage once your service connects.
