<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you schedule a private appointment in Microsoft Outlook 97, this does
not keep a delegate from scheduling an overlapping appointment in that time
period.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The text of a private appointment does not show when viewed by a delegate.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The delegate must view the schedule in the daily view (1 button on the
toolbar) and notice the color of the vertical bar to the left of the
subject meeting time. A colored bar means the time is busy.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook 97.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The text of a private appointment is viewable only by the calendar owner.
However, all appointments are color coded in the bar at the left edge of
the appointment time period. Light blue, means the time period is
tentatively scheduled, dark blue means the time period is busy, purple
means the owner is scheduled out of the office, and clear means the time is
available for scheduling.
<P>
NOTE: The colored bars do not display in full weekly or full monthly view
(7 or 31 button on the toolbar).
