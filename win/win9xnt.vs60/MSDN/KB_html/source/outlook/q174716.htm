<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Meeting Attendees automatically send a meeting request acknowledgment to
the Meeting Organizer when accepting a meeting. The Request Responses
option can only be turned off by the meeting organizer. This article
describes methods to turn this option off.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two methods to turn off the Request Response option. One is to
turn it off manually for every meeting request. The other is to create a
new appointment form and turn the option off programmatically.  This will
allow you set the new appointment form as your default.
