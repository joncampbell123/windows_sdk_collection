The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using Microsoft Outlook 97, the Archiving function may cease to work.
Clicking Archive on the File menu produces no action nor does setting
AutoArchive to archive every day at Startup. This behavior produces no
error messages.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You are storing your data on a Microsoft Exchange Server and have exceeded
the capacity of your allotted message store.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Delete some items from your Exchange Server store or move them to a local
personal folder store (PST).
<P>
-or-
<P>
Have the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator increase the size of your
server store.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The information store is the central repository for all messages on a
Microsoft Exchange Server computer. Each server can have two information
stores. The public information store holds all public folders and their
information, such as custom forms. The private information store holds all
private folders and their information, such as messages belonging to
individual mailboxes.
<P>
Storage limits are set on the amount of space, in kilobytes, that a public
folder or mailbox can occupy in the information store. The prohibit send
limit, represents the amount of space that a mailbox can occupy in the
private information store. Once a user reaches this limit, they can no
longer send messages from the mailbox. However, storage limits do not stop
a mailbox from receiving messages.
<P>
While you receive no error message when trying to archive items, you will
receive the following error message when attempting to send mail:
<P>
<PRE>   You are exceeding the size limit set on your mailbox by the
   system administrator.

   Your mailbox size limit is xxxx Kbytes
   You are currently exceeding this limit by xxxx Kbytes

   You may not be able to send new mail until you reduce your mailbox size.
   To free up space, delete any items that you are no longer using or move
   them to your Personal Folders. Items in all of your mailbox folders
   including the Deleted Items and Sent Items folders count against your
   size limit.  You must empty the Deleted Items folder after deleting
   items or the space will not be freed.

   See the Outlook Help topic, Deleted Items Folder, for more information.
