The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you export Microsoft Outlook 97 Contacts in either comma or tab
delimited format, any street addresses that contain more than one line are
exported with carriage returns separating the multiple lines. This may
results in a skewed output file containing multiple records for those
contacts containing multi-line street addresses.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In a comma or tab delimited file, carriage returns are interpreted as
record delimiters.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two options for correcting this problem:
<P>
<P><h3>Option 1</h3>
 
<P>
Export the file in comma delimited (csv) format, then open the file in
Microsoft Excel. The file will import correctly with one record per
contact and the multi-line street address in one cell.
<P>
NOTE: This option will not work if you export the file in tab delimited
(tsv) format.
<P>
<P><h3>Option 2</h3>
 
<P>
Export the file in either comma delimited (csv) or tab delimited (tsv)
format, then open the output file in Word and manipulate the data as
follows:

<OL><P><LI>On Edit menu, click Replace.

<P><LI>In the Find What window, type a double quotation mark (") then click
  Special and click Paragraph Mark.

<P><LI>In the Replace With window, type any special character not found in
<P><PRE>    your data, such as a pound sign (#).
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click Replace All.

<P><LI>In the Find What window, click Special and click Paragraph Mark.

<P><LI>In the Replace With Window, type whatever character you would like to
   use to separate the multiple street address lines, such as a percent
  sign (%).

<P><LI>Click Replace All.

<P><LI>In the Find What window, type the special character used in step 3
  above.

<P><LI>In the Replace With window, click Special and click Paragraph Mark.

<P><LI>Click Replace All.
<P>
</OL>After running this procedure, your file will have one record for each
contact. The multi-line street address will be in one field, surrounded by
quotation marks. Each street address line will be separated with the
character chosen in step 6, above.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook 97. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following, illustrates the problem described in the SYMPTOMS section
and the result of performing the procedure described in the RESOLUTION
section above.
<P>
The example below has a 2 line street address:
<P>
<PRE>   John Doe
   1234 Mockingbird Lane (address line 1)
   Apt 589               (address line 2)
   Dallas, TX 75123

</PRE></OL>The exported file will contain a carriage return ([CR]) following the word
"Lane" which results in two separate records for this one contact, as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>   "John Doe","1234 Mockingbird Lane[CR]  (record 1)
    Apt 589","Dallas, TX 75123"[CR]        (record 2)

</PRE>After performing the procedure described in the RESOLUTION section above,
the Resulting output will look as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   "John Doe","1234 Mockingbird Lane%Apt 589","Dallas, TX 75123"[CR]

</PRE>NOTE: This example assumes the percent sign "%" was used as the separator
for the street address lines.
