<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you receive e-mail messages in Microsoft Outlook 97, there is no
immediate way to determine if the message is sent directly to you, sent to
you as a member of an alias, or sent as a carbon copy. This article
describes a way to display how the message is addressed to you, without
opening the message.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can add a user-defined field to the column headings in your Inbox.
This field will indicate if your name is the only name in the "To" field,
the "Cc" field, or in an alias.
<P>
To add the custom field in your Inbox, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the View menu, click Field Chooser. In the Field Chooser dialog 
   box, click New.

<P><LI>In the Name box, type a unique name such as To?

<P><LI>In the Type list, click Formula.

<P><LI>Click Edit, and then type the following text into the Formula box,
   substituting your user name for "E-mail User." (Do not delete the
   quotation marks.)
<P>
   IIf([To]="E-mail User","To",IIf(InStr(1,[To],"E-mail
   User",1),"(To)",IIf([Cc]="E-mail User","CC",IIf(instr(1,[Cc],"E-mail
   User",1),"(CC)","Alias"))))
<P>
   NOTE: Do not delete the quotation marks. The only spaces allowed in the
   formula are in your user name. If you are using the original Internet
   Mail Service, your user name is the "Full Name" in the Personal
   Information section of the Internet Mail Properties. If you are using
   the Internet Mail Enhancement Patch, your user name is the "Name" in
   the User Information section of the General Properties of the service.
   If you are using the Microsoft Exchange Server Service, your user name
   is the name shown as your resolved mailbox name in the Microsoft
   Exchange Server Properties.

<P><LI>Click OK to close the Formula editor, and then click OK to close the New
   field dialog box.

<P><LI>Drag the new field from the Field Chooser into an appropriate position 
   in the column headings.

<P><LI>Close the Field Chooser.
<P>
</OL><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about creating special fields, type "user-defined
fields" in the Office Assistant, click Search, and then click to view
"Create a custom field."
