The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to troubleshoot problems synchronizing your
Microsoft Exchange Server Mailbox with your offline folders file, sometimes
called the offline store (*.ost).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Follow these steps to determine if your offline folders are synchronizing:

<OL><P><LI>Using the right mouse button, click your Inbox or the folder you want
   to check, and from the context-sensitive menu, click Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Synchronize tab.
<P>
   NOTE: If you do not have this tab, you did not setup your profile to use
   offline folders.

<P><LI>Under "Statistics for this folder", check the following settings:
<P>
<PRE>     Last Synchronized on:        Date
     Server folder contains:      # Items
     Offline folder contains"     # Items

</PRE></OL>With synchronization, the number of items should match for the server and
offline folders. If no synchronization is occurring, or if synchronization
does not occur correctly, between the server folder and the offline folder,
check the following items:

<UL><LI>Your profile must include the Microsoft Exchange Server service and the
   Microsoft Exchange Server Mailbox has to be your default delivery
   location. Offline folders can only synchronize with an Microsoft
   Exchange Server Mailbox.
<P>
</UL>Follow these steps to check your profile settings:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Services.

<P><LI>On the Services tab, verify that the profile includes
   Microsoft Exchange Server.

<P><LI>Click the Delivery tab.

<P><LI>In the "Deliver new mail to the following location", box make sure
   "Mailbox - &lt;account name&gt;" is selected.

</OL></UL><LI>Even when you are not connected to a network, you must still log on to
   Windows to gain access to your offline folders file and password lists.
   Make sure when you start Windows that if you are prompted for a password
   you type the password and click OK. If you click Cancel, Windows will
   start without logging you in.

<LI>Make sure you are logged on to your local area network when you
   synchronize. You cannot gain access to your Exchange Server Mailbox
   unless you log on to the network.

<LI>Use either the manual or the automatic method listed below to initiate
   synchronization.
<P>
</UL><h3>Manual Synchronization</h3>
 
<P>
Select the folder you want to synchronize and on the Tools menu, click
Synchronize and then click This Folder to synchronize one folder or All
Folders to synchronize all offline folders. When synchronization begins you
should see a progress bar on your screen. If you have many items in your
Mailbox and you have not synchronized for a while, the synchronization may
take a long time.
<P>
<P><h3>Automatic Synchronization</h3>
 
<P>
The following steps cause Outlook to synchronize all offline folders
automatically each time you are online and quit Outlook:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click the General Tab.

<P><LI>Click to select "When online, synchronize with all folders upon
   exiting."
<P>
</OL><h3>Damaged Offline Folder</h3>
 
<P>
If all folders except the Inbox synchronize, or you cannot synchronize, you
may have a damaged offline folders file. To correct this problem disconnect
from the damaged offline folders file and create a new offline folders
file. Since your offline folders file is a replication of the information
stored on your Microsoft Exchange Server Mailbox, this procedure should not
destroy any information.
<P>
Follow these steps to create a new offline folders file:

<OL><P><LI>From the Tools menu, click Services.

<P><LI>In the services list, click to select "Microsoft Exchange Server" and
   click Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Advanced tab.

<P><LI>Click "Offline Folder File Settings."

<P><LI>Click Disable Offline use, and then click Yes.

<P><LI>Click "Offline Folder File Settings."

<P><LI>In the File box, type a different name for the OST file.

<P><LI>Click OK three times to close all dialog boxes.

<P><LI>Use the manual synchronization method above to synchronize your new OST
   file with your Microsoft Exchange Server Mailbox.
