The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When exporting contact telephone numbers from Microsoft Outlook 97 to the
Timex Data Link watch, phone numbers are no longer sorted in the watch
alphabetically based on the last name of the contact.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The contact phone number contains an extension number or the phone number
exceeds 12 digits.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This is a limitation of the Timex Data Link watch display.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Timex Data Link watch sorts phone entries alphabetically based on the
last name of the contact.
<P>
The Data Link watch Phone mode allows room to display the area code,
exchange, telephone number, a type designation (W-work, H-home, F-fax), and
the name of the contact. A telephone number can be up to 12 digits and a
contact name can be up to 31 characters.
<P>
The watch screen is split into three sections with the top section holding
the area code and exchange while the middle section displays the telephone
number and type designation. The third (lower) section holds the Contact's
name.
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
Jane Somebody's work telephone number is 555-555-1313 and John Doe's home
telephone number is 555-555-1212, this information will be displayed in the
watch in alphabetical order as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   555-555             555-555
   1212  H             1313  W
   Doe, John           Somebody, Jane

</PRE>When an extension is included in the telephone number, the first two
numbers of the extension will be displayed in the middle section. The
extension identifier, extension number, and type designation are all
inserted in the lower section. The watch will only recognize the letter "x"
or the abbreviation of extension (ext) and will only use the letter "x" as
the extension identifier. Any other letter or letters will be ignored.
<P>
Since this information is moved to the lower section and is inserted before
the name, the Contact is placed in alphabetical order based on the first
character in the lower section. This behavior also occurs with telephone
numbers longer than 12 digits such as international telephone numbers that
can be up to 13 digits if the international access code is included.
<P>
For example, if John Doe's work number is typed into the contact Business
Phone field as (555) 555-1212 x132 and Jane Somebody's work number is typed
into the contact Business Phone field as (555) 555-1313 with no extension;
the watch will display the phone numbers in the following alphabetic order:
<P>
<PRE>   555-555             555-555
   1313 W              1212 13
   Somebody, Jane      x132W-Doe, John

</PRE>If John's phone number is typed in as (555) 555-1212 132 and Jane's phone
number is typed in as (555) 555-1313 122, each with no extension
identifier, the watch would display the phone numbers in the following
alphabetic order:
<P>
<PRE>   555-555             555 555
   1313 12             1212 13
   22W-Somebody, Jane  32W-Doe, John
