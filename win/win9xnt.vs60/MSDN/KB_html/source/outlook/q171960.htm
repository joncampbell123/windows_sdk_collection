The default duration setting for new appointments and meetings is 30

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Outlook 97 and click the Calendar shortcut on the
   Outlook Bar.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Format View.

<P><LI>Click the arrow on Time, select one of the items, and then
   click OK. (In version 8.01 and later, this box is labeled Time
   scale.)
<P>
</OL>NOTE: In addition to changing the default length of your appointments and
meetings, the blocks of time that display in the Day view of the Calendar
reflect the same increment of time.
<P>
