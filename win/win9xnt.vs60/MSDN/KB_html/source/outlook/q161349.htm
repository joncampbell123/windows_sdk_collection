The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the address book to look up an address, information from your
Contact folder does not appear in the list.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Outlook 97 requires that you complete three steps before contact
information will be available through the address book:

<UL><LI>You must install the Outlook Address Book service.

<LI>You must check an address book option in the properties for the folder.

<LI>You must specify either an e-mail address or fax number for each item
   that you want to show up in the address book.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To verify or install the Outlook Address Book Service:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools Menu, click Services.

<P><LI>Confirm that the Outlook Address Book service is in the list of
   available information services.

<P><LI>If it is not, click Add.

<P><LI>In the "Add Service to Profile" dialog box, select the Outlook Address
   Book from the list of available services.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>Note: If Outlook Address Book is not in the list of services available to
add, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   Article-ID: <B><A href="../outlook/q173072.htm">Q173072</A></B>
   Title     : OL97: Outlook Address Book Service Is Not an
               Available Service

</PRE></OL>To mark the Contact folder for use with the Address Book:

<OL><P><LI>Switch to the Contact folder in question.

<P><LI>On the File menu, point to Folders, and then click Properties for
   Contacts.

<P><LI>In the Contacts Properties dialog box, click the Outlook Address Book
   tab.

<P><LI>Click to select the "Show this folder as an e-mail address book" check
   box and enter an appropriate name for the address book.

<P><LI>Click OK to apply the settings.
<P>
</OL>To check for an e-mail or fax number for a particular contact:

<OL><P><LI>Switch to the Contact folder in question.

<P><LI>Double-click the contact to open the item.

<P><LI>Examine the fields for e-mail address and/or fax number.
<P>
</OL>If there is no e-mail address or fax number, Outlook will not publish this
contact in the Address Book.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Outlook allows any Contact folder to be used by the Address Book, not just
the primary Contact folder. For example, if you create a new folder of
contacts called Friends, then you can specify that the contacts in the
Friends folder also show up in the address book.
<P>
The Contact folders show up in the address book as subcategories of an
entry called "Outlook Address Book."  If you click on the Outlook Address
Book instead of on one of the folder names, you will not see any contact
information. To see the contact information, you must click on the specific
folder name that contains the contact.
