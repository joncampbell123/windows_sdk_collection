IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In any Microsoft Office 97 program, the File Send To command may start
Lotus cc:Mail, or another e-mail program instead of Microsoft Outlook 97.
This may occur even though the Send command in WordPad starts Outlook.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You may be able to resolve this problem by making a modification to the
Windows Registry if your Registry contains the following key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Common\Mapidll

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
before you edit the registry.
<P>
Follow these steps to backup and then remove the key from the Windows
Registry:

<OL><P><LI>Quit all programs.

<P><LI>On the Windows taskbar, click Start and then click Run.

<P><LI>In the Open box, type regedit and then click OK.

<P><LI>In the left window of the Registry Editor navigate to and click to
   select the following key:
<P>
<P><PRE>    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Common\Mapidll
</PRE>
<P><LI>With the above key selected, on the Registry menu, click Export
   Registry File.

<P><LI>In the File name box, type Mapidll and make sure the Save in box is
   set to Desktop. Click OK to export a copy of the key to your desktop.
<P>
   NOTE: If you later need to add this key back into the Registry, you
   can double-click on the Mapidll icon on your desktop.

<P><LI>With the key still selected, press DELETE and at the confirmation
   prompt, click Yes.

<P><LI>On the Registry menu, click Exit to close the Registry Editor.
<P>
</OL>Now, when you use the File Send To command from Office programs, the
default e-mail program should start.
