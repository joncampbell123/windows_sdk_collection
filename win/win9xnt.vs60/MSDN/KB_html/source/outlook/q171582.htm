The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses the purpose and capacity of each of the following
storage facilities used by Microsoft Outlook 97 when running as a client to
a Microsoft Exchange Server:

<UL><LI>Personal Folders (PST) files located on the user's computer.

<LI>Offline Store (OST) files located on the user's computer.

<LI>Mailbox Folders located on the Microsoft Exchange Server.

<LI>Public Folders (PF) located on the Microsoft Exchange Server.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Personal Folders (PST) Files Located on the User's Computer</h3>
 
<P>
One or more PST files can reside on each user's computer. A PST can be
defined as your primary store, meaning that your mail is delivered to the
Inbox in that file and all of your other default Outlook folders, such as
Calendar, Contacts, Deleted Items, Journal, Notes, Sent Items, and Tasks
reside there. Or, a PST file can be defined as a secondary store, meaning
you can move items to it, either manually or with Inbox Rules, from your
primary store.
<P>
Each PST file can contain as many folders as you want and each folder can
contain a maximum of 16,384 (16 kilobytes) records. The total file size of
a PST cannot exceed 2 gigabytes (GB).
<P>
<P><h3>Offline Store (OST) Files Located on the User's Computer</h3>
 
<P>
Only one OST file can reside on each user's computer. The OST is always
defined as your primary store, meaning that your mail is delivered to the
Inbox in that file and all of your other default Outlook folders, such as
Calendar, Contacts, Deleted Items, Journal, Notes, Sent Items, and Tasks
reside there. The OST differs from the PST in that items residing in it can
also reside in the user's Mailbox on the Server. You can synchronize the
OST and Mailbox folders so that they always contain the same information.
This allows you to work offline when the server is unavailable; then, when
reconnected to the server, changes made offline will be uploaded to the
server and mail received while offline will be downloaded to the OST.
<P>
The OST file can contain as many folders as you desire and each folder can
contain a maximum of 16,384 (16 kilobytes) records. The total file size of
an OST cannot exceed 2 GB.
<P>
<P><h3>Mailbox Folders Located on the Microsoft Exchange Server</h3>
 
<P>
A Mailbox Folder for each user is stored on the server in the same database
store. The server has a capacity of 16 GB for one store, which translates
to millions of records. However, the server administrator may limit the
size of each user's Mailbox Folder.
<P>
<P><h3>Public Folders (PF) Located on the Microsoft Exchange Server</h3>
 
<P>
Public Folders reside on the server in the same database store. They
contain information shared by many users. Depending upon access
permissions, individual users can read, update, or add to the PF. The
server has a capacity of 16 GB for one store, which translates to millions
of records. However, the server administrator may limit the size of each
Public Folder.
