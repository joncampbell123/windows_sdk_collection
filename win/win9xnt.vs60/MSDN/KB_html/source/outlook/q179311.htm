The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Outlook 97 the "Keep an updated copy of this Task on my Task
List" is unavailable and a task request that you assigned to another user
does not update in your task list.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You have assigned a recurring Task.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To track assigned tasks you must assign each occurrence as an individual
task.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you send a recurring Task Request, individual occurrences of the Task
Request are generated, one at a time, in the assignee's Task list. That is,
when the assignee marks an instance of the recurring Task as complete,
Outlook generates the next occurrence of the Task. However, only a single
task record representing the recurring series is stored in the sender's
Task List. Therefore, Outlook does not send a status message until the
entire series is completed.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce the Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, point to New and click Task Request.

<P><LI>Fill in the To and Subject lines and click to select "Keep an
   updated copy of this task on my Task List."

<P><LI>Click the Recurrence button on the toolbar.

<P><LI>Click Daily and End After 3 Occurrences, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Notice that "Keep an updated copy of this Task on my Task List" is now
   unavailable (dimmed).

<P><LI>Click Send.
<P>
</OL>RESULTS: You are notified of the completion of the recurring series if you
selected "Send me a status report when this Task is Complete." However,
Outlook does not update the single task representing the series in your
Task List at the completion of each individual occurrence.
