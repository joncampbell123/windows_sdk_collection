The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you upgrade MSN, the Microsoft Network online service to version 2.5
and you double-click an e-mail address in Microsoft Outlook 97, you may get
the follow error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The name or distribution list entry has been deleted and is no
   longer a valid address book entry. The item cannot be found.

</PRE>The following set of conditions can result in the above message:

<UL><LI>You chose to upgrade your MSN mail account to POP3/SMTP servers.

<LI>You added the Outlook Internet Mail Enhancement Patch (IMEP) transport.

<LI>You removed the old MSN online service.

<LI>The e-mail address causing the problem is in the "From" field
   of a message received before upgrading MSN, or in a Contact created from
   such a message.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Version 2.0 of the MSN online service provided proprietary e-mail types of
MSN or MSNINET. When you removed the MSN online service, Outlook could not
find the Address Book in which these e-mail types were resolved. Therefore,
the Internet Mail service cannot recognize these types as valid and the
error condition occurs.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The are four tasks to resolve this problem:

<UL><LI>Add the MSN service back into your profile.

<LI>Add all e-mail addresses to your Contacts.

<LI>Remove the MSN service from your profile.

<LI>Change the e-mail type of all Contacts by exporting and
   re-importing the Contacts.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>

<P>
<P><h3>Add the MSN Service Back into Your Profile</h3>

<P><LI>Click to select The Microsoft Network Online Service, Click OK and quit
   Outlook.
<P>
</OL><h3>Add All E-Mail Addresses to Your Contacts</h3>
 
<P>

it to the Contacts folder. If you do not wish to reply or retain the
message do not move it to the Contacts folder.
<P>
<P><h3>Remove the MSN Service from Your Profile</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Services.

<P><LI>Click to select "The Microsoft Network Online Service", and click
   Remove, click OK and then quit Outlook.
<P>
<P>

   click Next.
