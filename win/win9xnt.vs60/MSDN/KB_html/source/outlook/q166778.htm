<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Profile.doc is a Microsoft Word 97 document which contains supplemental
information about how administrators can modify the default profile
settings used by Outlook's setup.  Administrators can customize the
Outlook.prf file before installing Outlook, or after installing but before
the user starts Outlook for the first time. The More Information section of
this article contains the complete text of this file, which is located in
the \Outlook\Profiles folder of the Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit
Compact Disc.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Outlook Profile Setup</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Outlook is a Windows Messaging application that requires a
Windows Messaging profile. Profiles detail the user's e-mail settings and
services, and are usually configured with the Mail and Fax application in
the Windows Control Panel.
<P>
When the user first starts Microsoft Outlook on a system without a Windows
Messaging profile, Outlook automatically creates a profile. The default
Microsoft Outlook profile includes services for Personal Folders and the
Outlook Address Book. After starting Microsoft Outlook, users can add
services for Internet Mail, Microsoft Mail, Lotus cc:Mail, or other
messaging systems.
<P>
Administrators can modify the default profile settings by customizing the
OUTLOOK.PRF file before installing Outlook, or after installation but
before the user starts Outlook for the first time.
<P>
<P><h3>How Outlook Profile Setup Works</h3>
 
<P>
If a valid Windows Messaging profile already exists on the system, then
Outlook simply uses that profile and does not create a new one.
<P>
If a valid profile does not exist, Outlook creates one. Outlook Profile
Setup works with NEWPROF.EXE, a utility provided with the Windows Messaging
System. When the user first starts Outlook, Outlook searches for
OUTLOOK.PRF in the user's Windows folder, verifies that the OUTLOOK.PRF
file includes the Custom=1 setting in the [General] section, and then runs
NEWPROF.EXE to create a new profile using the settings in OUTLOOK.PRF.
<P>
If OUTLOOK.PRF cannot be found, Outlook will launch the Windows Messaging
Inbox Setup Wizard.
<P>
<P><h3>Exchange Server Administrators</h3>
 
<P>
Exchange Server administrators should replace the default OUTLOOK.PRF file.
The default profile includes Personal Folders (a local .PST file) as the
default message store, and does not include the Exchange Server service.
Exchange administrators should copy EXCHANGE.PRF from the Office Resource
Kit to their shared Outlook installation drive, edit it to provide a
correct HomeServer= setting, and rename it OUTLOOK.PRF.
<P>
About the HomeServer= Setting
<P>
The HomeServer= setting is required for automatic configuration of an
Outlook profile for Exchange Server users. The listed server can be any
server in your Exchange domain; it does not need to be the user's specific
home server. Outlook will query the user directory of the server you
specify and will substitute the correct server name.
<P>
For example, if you have three servers-Server1, Server2, and Server3-in the
same Exchange Server domain, you could create a single OUTLOOK.PRF file
with HomeServer=Server1 for all Outlook installations. Outlook will
substitute the correct server name for each user.
<P>
You should create separate OUTLOOK.PRF files with specific server names to
allow for slow links or gaps in your wide-area network. For example, users
installing Outlook in Europe should be pointed to an Exchange Server in
Europe and not in North America.
<P>
<P>
If Outlook cannot resolve the user's name within the user directory of the
Exchange Server you specify, Outlook will not start. Use the Mail and Fax
application in the Windows Control Panel to provide the correct values for
the user's mailbox name and server name, then restart Outlook.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Mail Post Office Administrators</h3>
 
<P>
The EXCHANGE.PRF file in the Office Resource Kit also includes a list of
client settings for the Microsoft Mail post office messaging service. You
can edit EXCHANGE.PRF to install the Microsoft Mail service instead of the
Exchange Server service.
<P>
<P><h3>Configuring Outlook User Options During Profile Setup</h3>
 
<P>
Some Outlook user options can be configured during profile setup by editing
the OUTLOOK.PRF file. The complete list of valid settings is included in
EXCHANGE.PRF file in the Office Resource Kit. The configurable options
include:
<P>
- EmptyWastebasket - Indicates that the Deleted Items folder is
<PRE>  permanently emptied when exiting Outlook. Default is False.

</PRE>- SelectEntireWord - When selecting text, automatically selects entire
<PRE>  words. Default is True.

</PRE>- AfterMoveMessage - Opens the next, previous, or no message after
<PRE>  deleting the current message. Default is previous message.

</PRE>- CloseOriginalMessage - Closes the original message when the user replies
<PRE>  or forwards. Default is False.

</PRE>- GenReadReceipt - Requests a read receipt report for every sent message.
<PRE>  Default is False.

</PRE>- GenDeliveryReceipt - Requests a delivery confirmation report for every
<PRE>  sent message. Default is False.

</PRE>- DefaultSensitivity - Specifies the default sensitivity level for new
<PRE>  messages. Default is Normal.

</PRE>- DefaultPriority - Specifies the default priority level for new messages.
<PRE>  Default is Normal.

</PRE>- SaveSentMail - Indicates that all sent messages are saved in the Sent
<PRE>  Mail folder. Default is True.

</PRE><h3>To Disable the Outlook Profile Setup</h3>
 
<P>
To disable the Outlook Profile Setup, copy NONE.PRF from the Office
Resource Kit to your shared installation drive, and rename it OUTLOOK.PRF.
