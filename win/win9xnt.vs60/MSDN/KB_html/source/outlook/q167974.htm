<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how you can remove sample Microsoft Outlook 97 forms
from your computer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides Sample Groupware Applications on the Microsoft Web site
that demonstrate how to use Outlook to solve business and personal needs.
These samples contain customized forms that reside in a Personal Folders
file, which you add to your Outlook profile.
<P>
The ValuPack also contains sample forms. The Valupk8.hlp help file contains
a topic, "Microsoft Office templates, forms, and wizards," which allows you
to install sample Outlook forms. These sample forms install as a Personal
Folders file (Forms.pst) in your profile.
<P>
You can remove these custom forms from your computer by:

<UL><LI>Identifying the name and path of the sample forms Personal Folders file
<LI>Removing the sample forms service from your profile
<LI>Deleting the sample forms Personal Folders file from your computer's
   hard drive
   
</UL><h3>Identify the Sample Form's Personal Folder File Name</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Outlook with the profile that contains the sample forms.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Services.

<P><LI>On the Services tab, click to select the Sample Forms folder and
   click Properties.

<P><LI>In the Path box, note the path and name of the file that contains your
   sample forms.
<P>
   By default, the sample forms from the ValuPack install to
   the following location:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Forms.pst
</PRE><P>
   By default, the sample forms from the Microsoft web site install
   to the following location:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C: Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\&lt;Month&gt; Outlook Samples.pst
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Remove the Sample Forms Service From Your Profile</h3>

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Services.

<P><LI>On the Services tab, click to select the Sample Forms service and
   click Remove.
<P>
   NOTE: The name of the service depends on what samples you installed.
   The ValuPack forms are in a "Sample Forms" service. The Internet forms
   are in a service named, "&lt;Month&gt; Outlook Samples."

<P><LI>When prompted, "Are you sure you want to remove this information
   service from the profile?" click Yes and then click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Delete the Sample Forms Personal Folders File From Your Hard Drive</h3>

   your sample forms.

   menu, click Delete.
