<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Outlook 97 does not provide for automatically synchronizing a
Personal Folder file (PST) between two different computers. However, this
article suggests three workarounds.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Option 1: Use an Off-line Store (OST) File</h3>
 
<P>
If you are running Microsoft Exchange Server as your mail service, the
best way to synchronize data between two computers is to use an Off-line
Store (OST) file. This will allow for automatic synchronization between
the data stored on the server and each computer using the server store.
<P>
For more information on using an off-line store, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Title     :   OL97: What Are Offline Folders and How Do You Use Them?

</PRE><h3>Option 2: Copy the Personal Folder (PST) File</h3>
 
<P>
You can use a Personal Folder (PST) file and copy it from one computer to
another. A problem with this technique is that a PST file can become
very large; it may be too large to copy to a diskette. In this event, you
can use Windows Backup or another backup utility with the ability to write
a file over multiple disks.
<P>
NOTE: You can use the Briefcase application to synchronize the two machines
if the PST file is less than 1.44 MB in size.
<P>
For more information on the Briefcase application, please see the
following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     :  How to Share Outlook Folders Using the Briefcase

</PRE><h3>Option 3: Copy only the Calendar, Contacts and Task Folders</h3>
 
<P>
A large PST file is usually the result of e-mail stored in the Inbox
Deleted Items and other mail store folders. You can share only your
Calendar, Contacts, and Tasks, without sharing your mail folders by using
the following procedure:
<P>
NOTE: These steps must be performed on both computers intended to share
the PST information. The operations described in the following steps
require that you view the Folder List in Outlook by clicking Folder List
on the View menu.

<OL><P><LI>Define a second PST file.
<P>
   a. On the Tools menu click Services.
<P>
   b. Click Add and then click Personal Folders and click OK.
<P>
   c. Type a unique name for the new PST file such as, Shared.pst, and
<P><PRE>      click Open.
</PRE><P>
   d. Type a display name for the Personal Folder, such as, Shared Folders
<P><PRE>      and click OK, and OK.
</PRE><P>
   e. Exit and Log Off Outlook.

<P><LI>Copy your existing Calendar, Contact, and Task items to the new folders.
<P>
   a. Start Outlook.
<P>
   b. Right-click your old Calendar folder then click Copy "Calendar".
<P>
   c. In the Copy Folder dialog box, click your Shared Folders and click
<P><PRE>      OK.
</PRE><P>
   d. Repeat steps b and c above for both your Contacts and Tasks
<P><PRE>      folders.
</PRE><P>
</OL>You should now have Calendar, Contact, and Task folders in your new Shared
Folders file. VERIFY THAT THESE NEW FOLDERS CONTAIN ALL THE ITEMS IN THE
OLD FOLDERS BEFORE GOING TO THE NEXT STEP.

<OL><P><LI>Remove the contents of your old Calendar, Contacts, and Tasks folders.
<P>
   a. Click your old Calendar folder and in the Current View window,
<P><PRE>      click Active Appointments.
</PRE><P>
   b. On the Edit menu, click Select All.
<P>
   c. Right-click the selected items and click Delete.
<P>
   d. Click your old Contacts folder.
<P>
   e. On the Edit menu, click Select All.
<P>
   f. Right-click the selected items and click Delete.
<P>
   g. Click your old Task folder.
<P>
   h. On the Edit menu, click Select All.
<P>
   i. Right-click the selected items and click Delete.
<P>
</OL>You should now have mail still being delivered to your original Personal
Folder set while Calendar, Contacts, and Tasks are in your new Shared
Folder set. This new Shared Folder set (Shared.pst) should be small enough
to be conveniently copied to disk for transport between computers.
