<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
With the Inbox Assistant or the Rules Wizard in Microsoft Outlook 97, you
can create a rule to move incoming messages which meet certain criteria to
a specified folder. However, if you delete the targeted folder, the rule
continues to remove the incoming messages that match the rule, from the
Inbox.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The rule continues to move matching items to the specified folder, which is
now a subfolder of the Deleted Items folder.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Delete the folder from its new location as a subfolder of the Deleted Items
folder. This permanently deletes the folder and the rule will no longer
function.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you delete a folder in Outlook, the folder becomes a subfolder of the
Deleted Items folder. The Inbox Assistant and the Rules Wizard
automatically track the location of moved target folders; since the target
folder is now a subfolder of the Deleted Items folder, the rule continues
to move matching messages there.
