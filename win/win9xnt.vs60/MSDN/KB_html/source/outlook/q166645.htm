The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you print someone else's Microsoft Outlook 97 calendar, your name prints
in the header or footer instead of the calendar owner's name.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Outlook's print style, headers and footers use the print fields associated
with the person who has the shared resource open.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is different in Microsoft Outlook 97 version 8.02. This
release uses the name of the resource you have open when you print. If you
do not have version 8.02, you must manually edit the header or footer
information prior to printing.
<P>
You can manually edit the header or footer information before printing the
shared calendar. The user name field in the header or footer uses the name
of the person who has the calendar open. Delete the user name field and
type the name you want printed. Follow these steps to edit the header and
footer:

<OL><P><LI>For the calendar you are printing, on the File menu click Print.

<P><LI>In Print Style, click to select the style and then click Page
   Setup.

<P><LI>Click the Header/Footer tab.

<P><LI>Select the [User Name] field and delete it.

<P><LI>Type the name you want to appear in place of the user name.

<P><LI>Click OK and OK to print.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Administrators, who manage conference rooms and calendars for other people,
print updated calendars daily. When these administrators open the calendar
and print it, the header or footer of the printed page contains the
administrator's name instead of the calendar owner's name.
<P>
Outlook's print styles provide these five print fields:
<P>
<PRE>   [User Name]
   [Page #]
   [Total Pages]
   [Date Printed]
   [Time Printed]

</PRE></OL>Outlook uses the user name of the person who has the shared resource open.
In this situation that is the person who is printing.
<P>
If a profile does not contain any e-mail services, the User Name field will
be blank.
<P>
If there is more than one e-mail service in a profile, the user name will
be taken from only one of the services. The service the name is taken from
depends on which e-mail services are in the current profile. Certain
services take precedence over others. For example, if your profile includes
Microsoft Exchange Server along with any other e-mail service, the user
name from your Exchange mailbox will be used regardless of what other
services make up the profile.
