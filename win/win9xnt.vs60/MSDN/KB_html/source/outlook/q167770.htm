The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Outlook Address Book as a data source for a mail merge in
Microsoft Word 97, the Outlook 97 Contact records are converted into a file
named, ~~~_virtual_file_~~~.olk. Some Outlook fields are not available in
this file and some field names are a bit different from what they are in
Outlook. This article describes the Outlook fields available to Word Mail
Merge and lists those that are not available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A few fields in the "All Contact Fields" group in Outlook have different
names in Word Mail Merge. Most have the same name in both Outlook and Word
but 63 are not available in Word at all. No user-defined Outlook fields are
available in Word.
<P>
NOTE: To access more Outlook Contact fields you can export the Contact
folder via a comma or tab delimited file, and use that file as the Word
Mail Merge data source, rather than the Outlook Address Book.
<P>
The following are the Word Merge Fields with their corresponding Outlook
fields, as they appear in the Word "Insert Merge Field" list.
