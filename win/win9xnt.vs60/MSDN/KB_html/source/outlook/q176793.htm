The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An appointment in Microsoft Outlook 97, set as an "All day event," appears
to span two days when viewed from another time zone.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Selecting the All Day Event option schedules the appointment from 12:00
A.M. to 12:00 A.M. When the calendar is viewed from another time zone the
time is adjusted for that time zone, therefore the appointment overlaps two
days. This makes the appointment appear to span two days.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook 97.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When an appointment is set as an "All day event" its title is displayed in
a heading bar at the top of the schedule window. The time from 12:00 A.M.
till 12:00 A.M. is blocked out in the schedule with a colored bar down the
left edge of the window. The color of this bar indicates whether the time
is set as Free (white bar), Tentative (light blue bar), Busy (dark blue
bar), or Out of Office (purple bar).
<P>
When viewed from another time zone, the event's title bar displays a small
clock, indicating that the time of the appointment has been adjusted from
the original time zone. If the event is viewed from a time zone that is two
hours later than the original time zone, the time will be adjusted to 10:00
A.M. of one day till 10:00 A.M. of the next day. Both days will show the
events title bar.
