<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Microsoft Outlook 97 you receive the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   The add-in "c:\omnipage for Windows 95\opexch32.dll" could not be
   installed or loaded. Unable to load 'c:\omnipage for Windows
   95\opexch32...". You may be out of memory, out of system resources,
   or missing a file.

</PRE>After you click OK, Outlook runs normally.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You have used and then removed OmniPage Pro for Windows 95 scanner software
version 8.0. This process didn't completely update the system configuration
when the OmniPage software was removed or uninstalled.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options and on the General tab, click Add-in
   Manager.

<P><LI>Click to select Opexch32.dll and click Remove.

<P><LI>Quit Outlook.
<P>
</OL>When you restart Outlook you will not receive the error mentioned above.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Outlook add-ins have several components. Typically there is an extended
configuration file (.ecf) and a code library (.dll). In the scenario
described above the .ecf file is still present while the .dll has been
removed.
<P>
OmniPage Pro 8.0 is manufactured by Caere Corporation, a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
