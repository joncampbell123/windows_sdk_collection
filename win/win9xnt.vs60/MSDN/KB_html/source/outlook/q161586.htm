<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you create a custom Microsoft Outlook 97 form based on the Mail Message
form, when you try to set the custom form as the default form for the
Inbox, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   You cannot create an item of this type in this folder.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The base message class (an internal property) of the custom form does not
match the Inbox folder's base message class.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Publish the custom form in the Folder Forms Library for the Inbox and use
the form from the item (Compose) menu.
<P>
To publish the form in the Inbox Folder Forms Library, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>With the custom form open, on the File menu, click Publish Form
   As to open the Publish Form As dialog box.

<P><LI>In the Publish Form As dialog box, click Publish In to open the
   Set Library To dialog box.

<P><LI>From the Folder Forms Library list, select the Inbox.

<P><LI>Click OK, and then OK again.
<P>
</OL>To use the form, on the Compose menu, click new &lt;form name&gt;, where
&lt;form name&gt; is the name of the form that you just published.
<P>
NOTE: There is no way to have a custom form applied to incoming mail. All
mail that is received will have a message class of IPM.Note and will use
Outlook's default mail message form. This means that there is no way to
have Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) code run when a message is
received. A workaround would be to create a Visual Basic program that runs
continuously (an "agent") and periodically automates Outlook to process new
items in the Inbox.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To set a default form for a folder, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Using the right mouse button, click the folder, and then click
   Properties on the shortcut menu.

<P><LI>Click the General tab, and specify the default form by selecting the
   "When posting to this folder, use" choice.
<P>
</OL>If the base message class of the custom form and the folder type do not
match, you will receive the error message mentioned in the "Symptoms"
section of this article. The base message class of the form and the folder
must match before you can set the form as the default form.
<P>
The table below lists the folder type and its message class.
<P>
<PRE>   Folder Type        Base Message Class required for default form
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
   Mail Items         IPM.Post
   Task Items         IPM.Task
   Appointment Items  IPM.Appointment
   Contact Items      IPM.Contact
   Journal Items      IPM.Activity

</PRE></OL>When creating a custom form based on the Mail Message form, the base
message class is IPM.Note. This base message class is not one of the
classes that you can set as default; therefore, you cannot set a custom
Mail Message form as default for any of these Outlook folders.
<P>
For folders other than mail item folders, this is not limiting behavior.
If you are designing a custom form for a Task folder, you start with the
built-in Task form which has the IPM.Task message class; therefore, the
base message class is compatible. The only folder type that has this
limitation is the Mail Items folder type.
