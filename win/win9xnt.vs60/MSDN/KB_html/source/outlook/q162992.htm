The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
<LI>Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Outlook 97 cannot share information, such as Outlook calendars,
contacts, and tasks, when using the Microsoft Mail information service. In
this case, you can use Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows version 7.0 with
Outlook to share contact, calendar, and task information.
Net Folders" feature.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Mail (MS Mail or SFS) and Workgroup Mail (WGPO) provide a shared
set of folders called Microsoft Mail Shared Folders. The Workgroup Mail
that ships with Windows for Workgroups 3.11 does not provide these folders.
<P>
Outlook folders that contain contact, calendar, task, notes, or journal
items require a specific level of MAPI storage. The Microsoft Mail Shared
Folders do not support this level of storage.
<P>
Because MS Mail cannot store this MAPI information, you can create only a
mail item in the Microsoft Mail Shared folders. You cannot create calendar,
contact, task, note, or journal items in the Mail Shared Folders without
receiving the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Unable to create the folder. A folder of that type cannot be
   created here.

</PRE>This limitation also applies to publishing forms in the Microsoft Shared
Folders.
<P>
Using Microsoft Exchange Server enables you to share all Outlook items. It
also provides a feature called Public Folders that you can use with custom
forms and any type of Outlook folder item to share information.
<P>
<P><h3>Viewing Free/Busy Time and Meeting Requests</h3>
 
<P>
With Outlook, you can to view free/busy time using the MS Mail service.
When creating an appointment or meeting from within Outlook, you can choose
the Meeting Planner tab, and view free/busy time for attendees by typing
their name in the space provided. You cannot view details or calendar
information for users, but you can see whether they are available. In many
cases, this is all the functionality you need.
<P>
Follow these steps to view free/busy time:

<OL><P><LI>On the Outlook Calendar menu, click New Meeting Request or New
   Appointment.

<P><LI>In the Appointment dialog box, click the Meeting Planner tab.

<P><LI>Click to select Show Attendee Availability.

<P><LI>In the "Type attendee name here" box, type the desired user name.
<P>
</OL>If the user is publishing free/busy information, the user's free and busy
times show to the right of the name.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Schedule+ as Primary Calendar</h3>
 
<P>
Outlook provides an option that enables you to use or continue using
Schedule+ along with Outlook. Using both programs, you can take advantage
of Schedule+ for group (shared information) features, and Outlook for
personal information management. You provide this ability by enabling
Schedule+ as your primary calendar. Using Schedule+ as your primary
calendar will not prohibit you from maintaining personal calendar and
contact information in Outlook, but that information is not available to
other users.
<P>
Follow these steps to enable Schedule+ as your Primary Calendar:

<OL><P><LI>On the Outlook Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>In the Options dialog box, click the Calendar tab.

<P><LI>At the bottom of the dialog box, click to select "Use Schedule+ 95 as my
   Primary Calendar."
<P>
</OL>If this option is not available or dimmed, you need to install Schedule+ on
your computer. This option is only available if you installed the Schedule+
95 program.
<P>
Outlook ships with some support for Schedule+ 95, but this support does not
provide the full functionality of Schedule+ and is not enough to enable the
option to use Schedule+ as your primary calendar.
<P>
<P><h3>Sharing Information Using Schedule+</h3>
 
<P>
Using Schedule+ as primary calendar option in Outlook places a button on
the right side of your toolbar that activates the Schedule+ program. Once
inside Schedule+, you can maintain calendar, contact, and task information.
On the Schedule+ Tools menu, you can click Set Access Permissions and set
permissions for users to share the Schedule information. Once you set
permissions, any user can access your schedule by following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Schedule+ File menu, point to Open, and then click Other's
   Appointment Book.

<P><LI>In the Address Book list, click to select the user for whom you want to
   see calendar information. Keep in mind that this is only possible if
   that user is using Schedule+ and has granted you access permissions.
<P>
</OL><h3>Using Outlook for Personal Information Management</h3>
 
<P>
By clicking the icons on the Outlook bar, you can create appointments,
contacts, and tasks for personal information management, just as you can
with Schedule+. The difference is that the information you create in your
calendar, contact, or task folders in Outlook is not available to other
users. For example, if you want to keep a contact list of your friends and
family, you can click the Contacts folder and create a contact for each
person. This information is not available to your coworkers, but you can
use it to Mail Merge from Microsoft Word, write personal letters, or
journal e-mail messages to that person.
