GTE's Internet Mail system uses one server for receipt of messages and a
second server for sending messages. In the Internet Mail service profile,
the Internet Mail server box identifies the mail server from which you
receive mail (incoming). The Advanced Options of the Internet Mail service
profile enables you to name the sending e-mail server (outgoing).
