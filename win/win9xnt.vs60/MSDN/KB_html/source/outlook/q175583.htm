The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you send or post a custom form in Microsoft Outlook 97 you may
receive the message:
<P>
<PRE>   A Field on this Form Requires a Value

</PRE>When you click OK the control that requires input may or may not be
revealed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There is a custom field on the form that requires a value that was not
filled in.
<P>
-or-
<P>
A control that was bound to a field requiring input may have been
deleted but the field was not deleted and is still associated with the
form.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use either of these two methods to resolve the problem.

<UL><LI>Fill in the field that requires input.

<LI>Delete the field from the form.
<P>
</UL><h3>Fill in the Field that Requires Input</h3>
 
<P>
After you click OK, focus moves to the control that requires input; there
may be more than one control on your form requiring input. Until all the
controls that require input are filled in you will continue to get the
error.
<P>
<P><h3>Delete the Field from the Form</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: These steps assume you deleted the control from the form but did not
delete the field.

<OL><P><LI>Open the form. On the Tools menu, click Design Outlook Form.

<P><LI>Click the All Fields tab. Click to select the field that is no longer
   used and then click Delete.

<P><LI>Click Yes to confirm that you want to delete the field.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A problem is that the message doesn't indicate which field requires a
value. If the same form page is displayed, the insertion point will move to
the proper field, but if the field is on a different page, you may need to
work through each field to find it.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open a form. On the Tools menu, click Design Outlook Form.

<P><LI>Click P.2 to open a blank page on the form.

<P><LI>In the Field Chooser, click New. Type the name of the field and click
   OK.

<P><LI>Drag the new field from the Field Chooser onto your form.

<P><LI>Right-click the text box and click Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Validation tab; then click to select the "A value is required
   for this field" check box. Click OK.

<P><LI>Click the control to select it and delete it from the form.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Design Outlook form.

<P><LI>Click the Message tab and send the form to yourself.
