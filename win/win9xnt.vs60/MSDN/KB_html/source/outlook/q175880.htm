<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>

receive e-mail using MSN, The Microsoft Network, version 2.5.
<P>
NOTE: Once you upgrade your Mail Account, you cannot change back to the
Classic Mail Account.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>The MSN 2.5 Setup</h3>
 
<P>
When the MSN 2.5 Setup completes, you will see the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Ready to Go Online

   MSN setup is almost complete. There are just a few finishing touches we
   need to make to your new email and chat programs

   Please double-click the MSN icon on your desktop now to go online, and
   we'll do the rest!

</PRE>After double clicking the MSN icon on your desktop, MSN will connect and
the browser will present a page with the title "Downloading...". MSN will
automatically continue to the next page which is titled "Internet Mail
Upgrade." The following options appear on this page:

<UL><LI>I want to use Internet Mail (recommended)

<LI>Tell me more about Internet Mail
<P>
</UL>If you select the first option, it configures Outlook Express and upgrades
your mail account on MSN to SMTP/POP3 servers. At this point, you can no
longer use the Microsoft Network Online Service. You must use either
Outlook Express or Outlook 97 with the Internet Mail Enhancement Patch.
<P>
If you want to use Outlook 97, you must use the Internet Mail Enhancement
Patch. For more information on the Internet Mail Enhancement Patch please
refer to the "Downloading the Internet Mail Enhancement Patch" and
"Configuring Outlook 97 with the Internet Enhancement Patch" sections
later in this article.
<P>
If you select the second option, a page titled "More about Internet Mail"
appears with more information about using Internet Mail with the following
options:

<UL><LI>Great! I want to use Internet Mail (recommended)

<LI>Thanks, but I'll keep my current e-mail program
<P>
</UL>If you select the first option, it configures Outlook Express AND upgrades
your mail account on the MSN to SMTP/POP3 servers. At this point, you can
no longer use the Microsoft Network Online Service. You must use either
Outlook Express or Outlook 97 with the Internet Mail Enhancement Patch.
<P>
If you want to use Outlook 97, you must use the Internet Mail Enhancement
patch. For more information on the Internet Mail Enhancement Patch please
refer to the "Downloading the Internet Mail Enhancement Patch" and
"Configuring Outlook 97 with the Internet Enhancement Patch" sections
below.
<P>
If you select the second option, it does not upgrade your mail account on
the MSN servers. At this point, you can continue using the Microsoft
Network Online Service.
<P>
If you did not upgrade your mail account during the above setup process,
you can do so at a later time by connecting to:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://setup.msn.com/membersonly/config/choose2.htm">http://setup.msn.com/membersonly/config/choose2.htm</A></B>

</PRE>The above link will re-connect you to the "Internet Mail Upgrade" page,
where you can select the "I want to use Internet Mail (recommended)"
option.
<P>
<P><h3>Benefits of Upgrading Your Mail Account</h3>
 
<P>
Some of the benefits of upgrading your Mail Account on the MSN servers
include:

<LI>The ability to send MIME-encoded attachments
<LI>Support for the POP3/SMTP Internet-standard protocol.
<P>
</UL>WARNING: Once you upgrade your Mail Account, you cannot change back to the
Classic Mail Account.
<P>
<P><h3>Download and Install the Internet Mail Enhancement Patch (IMEP)</h3>

account use the Internet Mail Enhancement Patch (IMEP).
<P>

<OL><P><LI>Visit the Microsoft Web site:

</PRE>
<P><LI>Click "Internet Mail Enhancement Patch Final Release" and follow the
   instructions to download the file.

<P><LI>When you are prompted to Open or Save to Disk, click Open.

<P><LI>Follow the instructions to install the IMEP Final Release and then
   restart your computer.
<P>
</OL><h3>Configuring Outlook with the Internet Mail Enhancement Patch</h3>
 
<P>

  2. Click the Start button, point to Settings and click Control Panel.

  3. Double-click the Mail and Fax icon and click Show Profiles.

  4. Double-click the profile you would like to use to receive your MSN
     e-mail.

  5. If listed, click to select the "Microsoft Network Online" service and
     click Remove.

  6. Click Add and double-click the Internet E-Mail service to
     add it to your profile.

  7. Under Mail Account, type a name for the service (for example, MSN).

  8. Under User Information, type the appropriate information about the
     account you are using in the Name, Organization, E-mail Address, and
     Reply Address boxes. The entries in the Organization and Reply Address
     boxes are optional.

  9. Click the Servers tab and type "smtp.email.msn.com" (without
     quotation marks) in the Outgoing Mail (SMTP) box.

    If you connect using a modem and the MSN connection, click "I use a
    modem to access my e-mail", and then click to select MSN in "Use the
    following Dial-Up Networking connection." If you connect using a modem
    and want to use a different Internet Service Provider (ISP), select it
    from the list. If an appropriate connection does not exist, you can
    create one using the Add button.

</PRE><P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Click the Delivery tab. If there are multiple Internet Service
<P><PRE>    Providers listed, select the Internet Mail information service you want
    to use as your primary mail service. One of the features of the
    Internet Mail Enhancement Patch is the ability to configure more than
    one ISP in a single profile.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click the Up until the ISP you have selected as your primary mail
<P><PRE>    service is at the top of the list and click OK.
</PRE><P>

the Microsoft Exchange Server information service, the profile sends
incoming mail to the Microsoft Exchange Server information service. To use
the Internet Mail information service, create a separate profile with a
Personal Folders file (.pst).
