<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Outlook 97, the CompuServe Mail information service can be
used without the CompuServe software. This article discusses
the configuration properties of the CompuServe Mail information
service.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can install the CompuServe Mail information service for use with
Outlook even though you do not have the CompuServe software installed
on your computer. Additionally, CompuServe Mail is TAPI (Telephony
Application Programming Interface) compliant and dials directly to your
modem to call the CompuServe network, so a Windows 95 Dialup Networking
connection is not required.
<P>
For information on obtaining and installing CompuServe Mail, please refer
to the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge base:
<P>

Title: OL97: How to Get Latest Version of CompuServe Mail Service
<P>
<P><h3>CompuServe Mail Configuration</h3>
 
<P>
The CompuServe Mail Properties contain four tabs:
<P>
<P><h3>General</h3>
 
<P>
This tab contains information specific to your CompuServe account. Items
such as your Name, CompuServe ID, and your password reside here. All
information in this tab is required except for your password. If you leave
your password blank, Outlook will prompt you for your password each
time you start Outlook.
<P>
<P><h3>Connection</h3>
 
<P>
This tab contains information on your connection. Items such as the
CompuServe Access telephone number, which modem to use, and Winsock
settings.
<P>
Phone Number:
<P>
Enter the telephone number you use to access CompuServe.
<P>
<PRE> NOTE: To use the TAPI dialing properties specified for your modem,
       (such as dialing "9," to access an outside phone line) enter
       the phone number in the following format:

      +c (aaa) xxx-yyyy
      |    |      |_____________ phone number
      |    |___________area code (parentheses required)
      |__________plus sign followed by country code

      Example:  +1 (614) 764-2957.

<P>
Network:

<P>
Windows Modem Settings:
<P>
Select the modem you have installed to use your preferred TAPI line.
<P>
Winsock Connection:
<P>
Select this to establish a special connection to the Internet known as a
WinSock connection, which gives you full access to the Internet. You can
review or modify your WinSock settings by using the Configure button.

allows you to easily establish a PPP connection. Note that you can also
set the Dialer up to logon and retrieve mail while you are simultaneously
using other CompuServe Dialer-compliant programs such as WinCIM 2.0
and Mosaic 2.0; refer to your CompuServe Mail for Microsoft Exchange
documentation for more details. This setting is dimmed or unavailable if
the Dialer is not installed.
