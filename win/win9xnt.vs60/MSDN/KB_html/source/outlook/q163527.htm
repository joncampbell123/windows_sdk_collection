The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to print, print preview, or delete in Microsoft Outlook 97,
you may receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>    This action will apply to all items in the selected groups.

</PRE>If you click OK, the message closes without printing, print previewing, or
deleting.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem use a different view when grouping and
selecting items. For example, the following steps allow you to delete all
entries for a Contact from the Journal:

<OL><P><LI>In the Journal, select the Entry List view.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click "Group By Box."

<P><LI>Drag the Contact heading to the "Group By Box." This will group your
   Entry List by Contacts.

<P><LI>Right-click the appropriate Contact name heading and from the context-
</OL>sensitive
<PRE>   menu, click Delete. This deletes all Journal entries for that particular
   Contact.

</PRE></OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook 97. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Outlook exhibits the above behavior under the following conditions:

<UL><LI>You try to print, print preview, or delete items in your Journal, and
   you selected a group heading, instead of an individual item, and the
   current view is By Category or By Contact.

<LI>You try to print, print preview, or delete items in a mail folder, and
   you selected to group by categories, selected a group heading, and the
   current view is Message Timeline.
<P>
</UL>This behavior does not occur in Tasks, Contacts, Calendar, and
Notes. You can successfully print or print preview when using equivalent
settings in your Tasks, Contacts, Calendar, and Notes folders.
<P>
