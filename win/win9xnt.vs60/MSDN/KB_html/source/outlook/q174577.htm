The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Outlook currently does not support the direct import of Day-Timer 2.0
information. However, data can be exported from Day-Timer into an ASCII
delimited file, and then imported into Outlook.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Importing data from Day-Timer 2.0 is a four step process. The first three 
steps define and export the data from Day-Timer.

<OL><P><LI>Define the data to be exported from Day-Timer Organizer for Windows.

<P><LI>Choose the field order for the export file.

<P><LI>Export the data you want from Day-Timer Organizer into an ASCII 
   delimited file.

<P><LI>Import the Day-Timer delimited file into Outlook.
<P>
</OL>You can obtain more information on exporting an ASCII file from Day-Timer 
Organizer for Windows (Steps 1-3) from Day-Timer Inc. Because Day-
Timer Organizer for Windows is produced and updated by Day-Timer's Inc. we
are unable to provide the exact steps for exporting files.
<P>
Once you have exported the data from Day-Timer 2.0, import the data into
Outlook.
<P>
<P><h3>Importing the Day-Timer ASCII File into Outlook</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Import and Export.

<P><LI>Under "Choose an action to perform," click "Import from Schedule+ or
   another program or file" and click Next.

<P><LI>Under "Select file type to import from," click to select "comma
   separated value (windows)" and click Next.

<P><LI>In the File To Import box, type the path and file name of the file you
   want to import, or click Browse to navigate to the file. The ASCII
   delimited files exported by Day-Timer Organizer will have an .ASC
   extension.

<P><LI>In "Select destination folder," click the folder you want to store
   the imported data in and click Next.

<P><LI>Click "Map Custom Fields" if you want to control how fields map from
   your text data into the destination folder fields, otherwise click
   Finish.
