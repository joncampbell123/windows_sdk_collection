The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to control the view of your contacts. You can
control the order of fields in the card view as well as the sort order.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By default, the Contact folder "Address Card" and "Detailed Address Card"
views display the File As field first. These views also default to sort
your contacts by the File As field. The File As field defaults to the
contact's "last name, first name." While you can manually change the File
As field for each contact, there is no user interface to globally change
how this field behaves.
<P>
By defining a customized view or modifying an existing view, you can
globally rearrange the contact field and sort order. In this way, you can
sort your contacts on a different field, such as "Company."
<P>
The following steps demonstrate how to create a new view that lists your
contacts by Company instead of Name:

<OL><P><LI>Open your Contacts folder.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Define Views.

<P><LI>In the "Define Views for Contacts" box, click New.

<P><LI>In the "Name of new view" box, type Company Sort.

<P><LI>In the Type of view list, click Card.

<P><LI>Under "Can be used on" click All contact folders and then click OK.
    This will open the "View Settings for Company Sort" box. This
    box allows you to set the sort field and the order that fields appear
    in the Card view.

<P><LI>Click Fields to open Show Fields. This allows you to choose
    the fields displayed and arrange their order.

<P><LI>In the Available fields list, click to select the Company field and
    then click Add. In the "Show these fields in this order"
    list, click to select the Company field and repeatedly click Move
    Up, until Company is at the top of the list.

<P><LI>Click OK to return to the "View Settings for Company Sort" box
   and then click Sort.

<P><LI>In the Sort Items By list, click to select Company.

<P><LI>Click OK, OK, and Close to close all dialog boxes.

<P><LI>On the Standard Toolbar Current View list, click to select your new
    "Company Sort" view.
<P>
</OL>Your contacts should now appear in card view with the company name
appearing at the top of each contact. Your new view also sorts the contacts
by company name. Those contacts with no company name appear first in the
sort order.
