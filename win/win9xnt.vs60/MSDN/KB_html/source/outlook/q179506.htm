The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to distribute custom forms to other users of
Microsoft Outlook who are not using the same mail system or who are
otherwise not connected except through e-mail.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
After a form has been created you can publish the form to several
different locations. These locations include the following:

<UL><LI>A folder on your local computer, such as the Inbox

<LI>Your Personal forms library

<LI>Your Organizational forms library.
<P>
</UL>The process of distributing a form, to a person or to a group that is
outside your organization is different. You can do this by saving the form
as an Outlook Form Template (.oft), and then sending that file as an
attachment in an e-mail message. The recipients open the attachment and
publish the form to the appropriate location.
<P>
<P><h3>Saving the Form as an Outlook Form Template</h3>
 
<P>
To save the form as a template, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>With the form open, click Save As on the file menu.

<P><LI>Type the name of the form, and note or change the location in which you
   are saving the form.

<P><LI>In the Save As box, click to select Outlook Template(.oft).

<P><LI>Click Save, and then close the form.
<P>
   If you are prompted to save changes to the form, click No.
<P>
</OL><h3>Attaching the Form to a Mail Message</h3>
 
<P>
To attach the form, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open a new mail message.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click File.

<P><LI>Locate your file. Click to select it. Check to see that Attachment
   is selected in the Insert As box. Click OK.

<P><LI>Address and send the email message as usual.
<P>
</OL><h3>Opening and Publishing the New Form</h3>
 
<P>
To open and publish the form, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the recipients computer, open the mail message that contains the
   attached form.

<P><LI>Open the attached form by double clicking it.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Publish Form As.

<P><LI>Change the publishing location by clicking Publish In, Select the
   appropriate folder or forms library, click OK, and then click
   Publish.
