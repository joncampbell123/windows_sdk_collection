<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Outlook 97 can print multiple e-mail attachment files with the
original message. However, when you attempt to print multiple Microsoft
Excel attachments, some of the attachments may not be printed.
<P>
The original e-mail message is printed followed by the first Excel
attachment, and only some of the additional attachments if there are more
than two.
<P>
This problem does not occur with Microsoft Word attachments.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you are not using Microsoft Word (WordMail) as the
e-mail editor in Outlook, and you select the "Print attached files with
item(s)" check box in the Print dialog box.
<P>
If you are using WordMail, this check box does not appear in the Print
dialog box. You must always print each attachment individually.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, print each attachment individually. To do
this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Right-click the attachment.

<P><LI>On the shortcut menu, click Print.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you select multiple attachments by pressing SHIFT, only the first
attachment is printed. Other selected attachments are not printed. This
behavior is the same regardless of the type of attachment.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook 97. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
