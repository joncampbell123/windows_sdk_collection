</PRE><h3>Overview</h3>
 
<P>
This is an updated Internet Mail Service for Microsoft Outlook 97. The IMEP
is not an update to the Outlook client program itself, and does not add
features such as support for LDAP, IMAP, NNTP, and HTML. These features are
planned for future versions of the Outlook client, but are not part of this
Internet mail service update.
<P>
<P><h3>New Features</h3>
 
<P>
Internet mail users are familiar with several features added by the IMEP.
The patch includes:

<UL><LI>Support for multiple POP3 accounts in the same userprofile.

<LI>Leaving messages on POP3 servers.

<LI>Marking of original text with an angle bracket (&gt;) when replying to
   messages.
<P>
   NOTE:  This feature only works with Outlook[ASCII 146]s editor and
   does not work with WordMail.

<LI>Full message headers for Internet e-mail.
<P>
</UL>For a complete list of improvements included in the patch, refer to the
following knowledge base article:

    TITLE     : OL97: Improvements in the Internet Mail Enhancement Patch

</PRE><h3>Installation Instructions</h3>
 
<P>
Internet mail accounts are setup by selecting Services from the Tools menu
in Outlook, clicking on the "Add" button, and selecting "Internet E-Mail"
and filling in the fields as described below.
<P>
On the General Tab:

<UL><LI> Mail Account: Enter a friendly name for this account.

<LI> Name: Enter your full name here.

<LI> E-mail Address: Enter your e-mail address.
<P>
</UL>On the Servers Tab:

<UL><LI>Outgoing Mail (SMTP): Enter the name of your SMTP server.

<LI>Account Name: Enter the account name used for logging onto your POP3
   server.

<LI>Password: Enter the password used for logging onto your POP3 server.
<P>
</UL>On the Connections Tab:

<UL><LI>I use a LAN connection: Select this if you connect to your POP3 server
   over a dedicated link and want Outlook to check for new mail
   automatically. Note: Outlook will not make the call to your ISP for you
   if you use this setting.

<LI>I connect Manually: Select this if you connect to your
   POP3 server over a dedicated link or you establish your
   dialup networking connection yourself and don't want
   Outlook to check for new mail automatically.

<LI>I use a modem to access my e-mail: Select this if you
   connect to your POP3 server using the modem and want
   Outlook to make the call to your ISP for you.
<P>
</UL>There are a number of options you can control as well:

<UL><LI>Leave on server. On the Advanced tab, select the "Leave a
   copy of messages on server" checkbox. If you want to
   automatically delete messages that have been on the
   server for a couple of days, select the "Remove on Server
   after" checkbox and set the number of days.

<LI>Send replies to a different address. On the General tab,
   enter the address to which replies to your mail should be
   sent. If you want replies sent to your e-mail address,
   just leave this edit box blank.

<LI>Change the Ports used to connect with mail servers. On
   the Advanced tab, enter the SMTP and POP3 ports to use in
   the Server Port Numbers edit boxes.
<P>
</UL>Once you have setup an account, you can control a variety of options by
selecting Options from the Tools menu and then clicking on the Internet E-
mail tab:

<UL><LI>Wrapping messages. To control the wrapping of long lines
   to a specified length, select the "When sending messages,
   wrap text at" checkbox. Enter the maximum line length in
   the edit box.

<LI>Marking original message text with angle brackets. To
   mark original message text with angle brackets, select
   the "When replying to messages, indent original text
   with" checkbox. If you want to enter your comments below
   the original message, select the "Insert response and
   signature below original text" checkbox.

<LI>Check for new mail. If you want Outlook to automatically
   check for new mail for all accounts that are configured
   to connect using a LAN, select this checkbox. The edit
   box allows you to control how often Outlook should check
   for new mail.
<P>
</UL>The IMEP does not automatically call your ISP using dial-up networking to
check for new mail. To make Outlook automatically call your ISP, you need
to install the ISDN 1.1 accelerator pack (even if you don't use ISDN). The
ISDN accelerator pack can be installed from:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/getisdn/dload.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/getisdn/dload.htm.</A></B>

</PRE>After installing the ISDN accelerator pack, you need to:

<OL><P><LI>Set the connection type to "LAN" for all accounts that are to
    automatically check for new mail. To set the connection type in
    Outlook, click on the "Services" command in the "Tools" menu, select an
    internet mail account, click on the "Properties" button and then click
    on the "Connection" tab.

<P><LI>Open the Control Panel by clicking on "Control Panel" in the "Settings"
    menu on the Start Menu.

<P><LI>Double click on "Internet".

<P><LI>Click on the "Connection" tab.

<P><LI>Select "Connect to the Internet using a modem" and specify a dial-up
    networking connection.

<P><LI>Click on the "Settings" button.

<P><LI>Check the "Disconnect if idle" checkbox and set the timeout to 1
    minute. Click OK to dismiss dialogs.

<P><LI>Open the dial-up networking folder by double clicking on "My Computer"
    and then double clicking on "Dial-up Networking."

<P><LI>Select "Settings" from the "Connection" menu. Uncheck the "prompt for
    information before dialing" check box.

<P><LI>Double click on the dial-up networking connection you specified above.
    Enter your username and password and check the "Save Password"
    check box. Click on Connect and wait for the connection to be
    established. Disconnect.
<P>
</OL><h3>Uninstall Instructions</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to uninstall the files that the IMEP has installed, and revert
back to the version of the internet mail service that shipped with Outlook
97, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Outlook, use Tools | Options | General | Add-In Manager to remove
   Internet Mail.

<P><LI>Use File | Exit and Log Off to quit Outlook.

<P><LI>In Control Panel | Mail and Fax, remove the Internet E-Mail service from
   the default profile and any other profiles where you may have installed
   it.

<P><LI>Run Add/Remove Programs from the Control Panel and remove the "Microsoft
   Outlook Internet Mail Enhancement Patch".

<P><LI>Run the Office 97 Setup program and choose the "Reinstall" option.  This
   will restore the original Internet Mail driver.

<P><LI>In Control Panel | Mail and Fax, add Internet E-Mail back to your
   profile(s). (Note that the name of the service doesn't revert back to
   Internet Mail.)

<P><LI>Start Outlook.
<P>
</OL><h3>Problems fixed from the Beta</h3>
 
<P>
The following problems in the IMEP beta have been fixed:

<UL><LI>A non-delivery report (NDR) is received for all messages for some SMTP
   servers.

<LI>Duplicate messages are downloaded when "Leave on Server" turned on for
   some POP3 servers.

<LI>An NDR is received if the SMTP server cannot be contacted.

<LI>Angle bracket used for marking original message is in a very small font.

<LI>"Indent Original Message with" doesn't work with international versions
   of Outlook.

<LI>Message ID contains two "@" characters, causing problems with some
   gateways.

<LI>Cannot download an improperly terminated MIME message.

<LI>Cannot create or edit internet addresses in the PAB.
<P>
</UL><h2>Known Problems</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Installation Issues</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Problems upgrading from old "multiple accounts" configuration</h3>
 
<P>
There are some unsupported registry changes that can be made to allow the
original internet mail service to have multiple accounts in the same
profile. To upgrade successfully from this configuration to the IMEP, you
need to record any needed ISP information and then remove all instances of
the original Internet Mail services from your profile before installing the
patch.
<P>
<P><h3>IMEP requires both SMTP and POP3 Server Names</h3>
 
<P>
Even if the same server is used for both protocols, you must enter the name
of that server in both places in the dialog. This is a change from the
original Internet mail service.
<P>
<P><h3>Can't reuse the same friendly name for accounts within or between profiles</h3>
 
<P>
You cannot have two accounts on the same machine with the same friendly
name. If you try to use the same friendly name for more than one account
you will receive an error message stating "An account already exists with
that name."
<P>
<P><h3>Can't Install/Uninstall IMEP on MS Windows NT 4.0 without Admin. Privileges</h3>
 
<P>
You must have Administrative privileges to install or uninstall the IMEP on
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0. Cannot Install/Uninstall IMEP on Office "Run from
Network Server" or "Run from CD" installation.
<P>
In order to install the IMEP, you must have write permission on the
directory into which Office is installed.
<P>
<P><h2>Known IMEP Issues</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Outlook does not automatically call my ISP to check for new mail</h3>
 
<P>
See "Installation Instructions" above for details.
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot Ignore Original Message Text when spell checking replies</h3>
 
<P>
If you use the "Indent Original Message With" feature, you cannot ignore
the original message text when spell checking a reply you make.
<P>
<P><h3>"Mark my Comments with" doesn't work</h3>
 
<P>
If you use the "Indent Original Message With" feature, you cannot use the
"Mark my comments with" feature for replies.
<P>
<P><h3>"Indent Original Message with" feature does not work with WordMail</h3>
 
<P>
WordMail does an AutoFormat pass when you create or open a note to replace
the Internet reply prefix characters with real indentations. If you want to
use the "Indent Original message with" feature, turn WordMail off.
<P>
<P><h3>"Indent Original Message With" only works with e-mail Items</h3>
 
<P>
The "Indent Original Message With" feature, which allows you to prefix each
line of the original message with a specified character, only works with e-
mail Items. If you reply to a meeting request or a task request, the
original message will not be indented with the specified character.
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot Create "Internet Address" type in PAB</h3>
 
<P>
In order to create or edit Internet Addresses in your PAB, you need to re-
create your profile.
<P>
<P><h3>Message Conversion Fails</h3>
 
<P>
Under certain conditions, messages are not converted after being retrieved
from the POP3 server. When this happens, a message is created that contains
the original internet message as a text file attachment along with
instructions for the user to forward the message to imepbugs@microsoft.com.
The known circumstances in which this occurs are:

<UL><LI>The message contains an invalid Internet e-mail address. This usually
   manifests itself in a message sent by a list server that has a Reply-To
   field containing an empty set of angle brackets (e.g. Reply-To: &lt;&gt;).

<LI>The message was composed in a character set that is not supported by the
   IMEP.
<P>
</UL><h3>"Indent Original Message With" with International Versions of Outlook</h3>
 
<P>
To use the "Indent Original Message With" feature with international
versions of Outlook, you need to:

<OL><P><LI>Select "Options" from the Tools menu.

<P><LI>Click on the "Reading" tab.

<P><LI>Uncheck the "Use US English for included message headers" check box.
<P>
</OL>The feature works slightly differently with international versions of
Outlook than with the US version. The message headers are included in the
quoted message rather than consolidated into a single line.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Logging on to dialup server with incorrect user name/password causes error</h3>
 
<P>
If you have specified an incorrect user name on the Servers tab of the
Account Properties dialog, an "Unknown Error" will result. If you receive
this error, make sure you have entered the correct user name and password.
<P>
<P><h3>Long lines not wrapped on replies</h3>
 
<P>
When you set the "When replying to messages, indent original text with"
option, long lines in the original message are not automatically wrapped in
the reply unless you select the "When sending messages, automatically wrap
text at" checkbox.
<P>
<P><h3>Saving POP and SMTP session into Log File</h3>
 
<P>
To save the POP and SMTP sessions to a log file:

<OL><P><LI>Start "regedit" using the "Run" command on the Start Menu.

<P><LI>Open the registry key "HKCU/Software/Microsoft/Internet Mail and
   News/Mail".

<P><LI>Delete the value "Log Outlook (0/1)".

<P><LI>Create a DWORD value named "Log Outlook (0/1)".

<P><LI>Change the value of "Log Outlook (0/1)" to 1.

<P><LI>Change the value of "Log File (Outlook)" to the full path to the
   directory into which logging information is to be placed. A directory
   for each account will be created in this directory.

<P><LI>Exit and restart Outlook.
<P>
</OL>To turn logging of the POP3 and SMTP sessions off:

<OL><P><LI>Change the value of "Log Outlook (0/1)" to 0.
<P>
</OL><h3>Deleting Internet Mail from a copied profile corrupts original profile</h3>
 
<P>
If you create a second profile for your Internet E-mail Accounts by copying
another profile and then later delete the Internet Mail accounts from
either profile, the Internet Mail account in the remaining profile will be
corrupted. To fix this, you will need to delete the profile and recreate
the Internet Mail account.
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot change which account is used for sending mail</h3>
 
<P>
The IMEP only supports sending mail using one account. To change the mail
account used for sending mail:

<OL><P><LI>Click on "Services" on the "Tools" menu.

<P><LI>Click on the "Delivery" tab.

<P><LI>Select the account that should be used for sending mail in the
   "Recipient addresses are processed by these information sources in the
   following order" listbox and use the arrow buttons to move this account
   to the top of the list.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: this only changes the account that will be used for sending messages
that have not yet been composed. Any messages that have been submitted but
not yet transmitted to the mail server will not be affected.
<P>
An alternate workaround is to specify the address to which replies are to
be sent when composing a message. To do this:

<OL><P><LI>Click on the "Options" tab in the mail note.

<P><LI>Check the "Have replies sent to" checkbox.

<P><LI>Enter the e-mail address that replies should be sent to into the "Have
   replies sent to" edit box.
<P>
</OL><h3>IMEP Help disappears after installing another add-on from FreeStuff Website</h3>
 
<P>
If you install an add-in from the Outlook Free Stuff web site after
installing the IMEP, you will not be able to see the IMEP Help in the Help
Table of Contents. You will need to reinstall the IMEP, to see it in the
Table of contents. However, installing the IMEP will not affect how Help
appears in the Table of Contents of other add ins.
<P>
<P><h3>Ambiguous Dial-up Networking Prompt</h3>
 
<P>
If a dial-up networking connection is currently active and you check for
new messages on an account that uses a specific dial-up networking
connection, the following prompt is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   To connect to your '&lt;account #2&gt;' Internet E-mail
   Account on the '&lt;account #2&gt;' connection, your current
   '&lt;Account #1&gt;' connection will be closed. Do you want
   to continue? (Yes/No)

</PRE></OL>If you answer "Yes", the current dial-up networking connection is
terminated and the new connection is called. If you answer "No", an attempt
is made to contact the mail server on the current dial-up networking
connection.
<P>
<P><h2>General Issues with Outlook and Internet Mail</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Delivery and Read Receipts</h3>
 
<P>
Delivery Receipts are not supported with the IMEP. Read Receipts are
supported only for messages sent to a client that supports the Microsoft
Exchange rich-text format. To request a read receipt:

<OL><P><LI>Double click on the user in the To or Cc field.

<P><LI>Check the "Always send to this recipient in Microsoft Exchange rich-text
   Format" checkbox. Press OK.

<P><LI>On the Options page, check the "Tell me when this message has been read"
   check box.
<P>
</OL><h3>Cannot receive embedded objects</h3>
 
<P>
If you sent a message with an OLE embedding to someone whose E-mail client
does not support Microsoft Exchange rich-text format, the OLE embedding is
lost. An OLE embedding can only be sent to a client that supports the
Microsoft Exchange rich-text format. To send a message with an OLE
embedding:

<OL><P><LI>Double click on the user in the To or Cc field.

<P><LI>Check the "Always send to this recipient in Microsoft Exchange rich-text
   Format" checkbox. Press OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Outlook does not detect missing/incorrect Domain Name Service information</h3>
 
<P>
Outlook does not detect incorrect DNS information in your dial-up
networking settings. If you cannot connect to your mail server, you should
check the "Advanced" TCP/IP settings for the dial-up networking connection.
