The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft ClipArt Gallery, version 1.1
<LI>Microsoft Office for Macintosh, versions 4.2, 4.2.1
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Works for Macintosh, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to patch the ClipArt Gallery program you may see
a message similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   "ClipArt Gallery" (version 0.1.2) is older than version 0.1.4.

   This patch cannot be applied.

</PRE>The only option button available is the Cancel button.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The patch was designed to work with version 0.1.4. You will not be
able to patch any other version of the ClipArt Gallery.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, use the following steps to remove the old ClipArt
Gallery and then re-install ClipArt Gallery version 0.1.4.
<P>
<P><h3>Remove the ClipArt Gallery</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Back up your original ClipArt Gallery to a disk, and then delete the
   ClipArt Gallery from your computer.
<P>
   NOTE: The ClipArt Gallery program is normally located in the Microsoft
   folder.

<P><LI>Run Microsoft Office Setup or Microsoft PowerPoint Setup.
<P>
   Setup should be started in maintenance mode.

<P><LI>Click the Add/Remove button.

<P><LI>Under Installed Components, click the option triangle for Shared
   Applications.
<P>
   This reveals a list of all installed Shared Applications. If ClipArt
   Gallery does not appear in this list, skip the remaining steps and go to
   the "Add the ClipArt Gallery" section.

<P><LI>Clear (remove the X from) all items within the Shared Application
   section with the exception of ClipArt Gallery.
<P>
   After you complete this step, you should see marks in only two check
   boxes: ClipArt Galley and Shared Applications.

<P><LI>Click the Continue button to remove ClipArt Gallery and its registration
   information.

<P><LI>Double check that no ClipArt Gallery application exists on the hard
   disk drive.
<P>
</OL><h3>Add the ClipArt Gallery</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Run Microsoft Office Setup or Microsoft PowerPoint Setup again.

<P><LI>Under Components Not Yet Installed, click the option triangle for Shared
   Applications.

<P><LI>Clear (remove the X from) all items within the Shared Application
   section with the exception of ClipArt Gallery.
<P>
   When you have completed this step, you should see marks in only two
   boxes: ClipArt Galley and Shared Applications.

<P><LI>Click the Continue button to install the ClipArt Gallery.
<P>
</OL>Attempt to run the patch again. If the version of ClipArt Gallery on your
installation disks is version 0.1.4, the patch should now work.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When the patch mentions ClipArt Gallery version 0.1.2, it is not referring
to the version displayed in the Get Info window. It is referring to the
version listed in the vers resource. This vers resource is only visible
after you open the ClipArt Gallery with a special development tool.
<P>
After the patch is applied to the ClipArt Gallery, the version listed in
the Get Info window will change from 1.1 to 1.1a.
<P>
TIP: Enable Show Version within the Views Control Panel. When you view the
Microsoft folder by Name, Size, Kind, Label, or Date, the short version
string (0.1.2 or 0.1.4) will be visible.
