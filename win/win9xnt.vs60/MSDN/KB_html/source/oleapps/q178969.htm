Graph 97. This list is a compilation of the individual keyboard shortcut
lists available in Graph Help.
<P>
NOTE: Shortcut keys mentioned in the Help topics, menus, and dialog boxes
refer to the U.S. keyboard layout. Keys on other layouts may not correspond
exactly to the keys on a U.S. keyboard. If you are using a different
language keyboard layout from the version of Microsoft Word you are using,
you may have to make adjustments when using shortcut keys.
