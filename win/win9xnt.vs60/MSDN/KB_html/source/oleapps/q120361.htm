The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, you receive a general protection (GP) fault when you
drag information in another application to a cell on a worksheet if the
worksheet contains an active object.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs only if an object on a Microsoft Excel worksheet is
open for in-place editing when you drag information from another
application to the worksheet. For example, if you activate a Microsoft Word
6.0 document object on a Microsoft Excel worksheet, and you then drag a
task in a Microsoft Project project to a cell on the worksheet, you receive
a GP fault. This problem does not occur if an object on a Microsoft Excel
worksheet is open in the application that was used to create the object
(the client application).
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving a GP fault when you drag information in another
application to a cell on a Microsoft Excel worksheet, make sure that any
objects located on the destination worksheet are not active by selecting
any cell on the worksheet before you drag the information to the worksheet.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can move data between Microsoft Excel and certain other applications by
dragging the data as long as the other application also supports OLE. This
method is similar to using the Cut and Paste commands; however, this method
does not use the Clipboard.
