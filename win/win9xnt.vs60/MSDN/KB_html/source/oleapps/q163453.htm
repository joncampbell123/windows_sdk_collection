<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you run the Setup program for the products listed at the beginning of
this article, the program indicates that the installation is 100 percent
complete and that the system is being updated. However, the following error
message may occur
<P>
<PRE>   ARTGALRY.DLL is unable to register itself in the Registry

</PRE>and Setup is not completed successfully.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the Artgalry.dll file is not installed correctly
or when the file has become corrupted.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use Microsoft Windows Explorer to locate and
rename the Artgalry.dll file, and then run Setup again. This file is
usually located in the Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Artgalry
folder. Rename the Artgalry.dll file to Artgalry.bak, and then run Setup
again. When the Maintenance Mode Setup dialog box is displayed, click
Reinstall.
