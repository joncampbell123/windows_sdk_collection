<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 98 Macintosh Edition
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Graph 98 for Macintosh Edition

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If a three-dimensional pie chart is created in Microsoft Graph, and the
data for the chart consists of a single number, that number will produce a
one-piece pie chart with a line connecting the center point to the outside
of the pie. There is no way to remove this central line using Microsoft
Graph.
<P>
The following article describes a method to remove the line using Microsoft
PowerPoint.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you want this pie chart to appear in a PowerPoint slide without the
single line (for example, you want to use a cylindrical shape in a
system diagram), you can perform the following steps:
<P>
<P><h3>PowerPoint 95, 97, and 98</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Select the chart in Slide view.

<P><LI>On the Draw menu, click Ungroup. WARNING: Ungrouping the Chart
   converts the chart to Microsoft Drawing objects, you are no longer able
   to edit the object with the Graph program. However, if needed you can
   undo the ungroup operation.

<P><LI>Then you may see a message similar to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      This is an imported object not a group. If you convert it to a
      Microsoft Office drawing, embedded data or linking information will
      be lost. Do you want to convert the object?
</PRE><P>
   Click Yes to ungroup the object.

<P><LI>Select the part of the chart that includes the line.

<P><LI>On the Format menu. click Format AutoShape.

<P><LI>Click the Colors and Lines Tab.

<P><LI>Set the Line Color to No Line and click OK.
<P>
</OL>To ensure a consistant look and feel, remove the lines from the other parts
of
the chart.
<P>
<P><h3>PowerPoint 3.0 for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: Do NOT do this with a two-dimensional pie chart in PowerPoint for
Windows. It will result in the loss of the chart.

<OL><P><LI>Select the chart in Slide view.

<P><LI>On the Arrange menu, click Ungroup. WARNING:  This will break
   the link between the chart and the datasheet, and you will no
   longer be able to edit the chart in Microsoft Graph.

<P><LI>Click away from the chart so that no objects are selected.

<P><LI>Double-click the top portion of the chart (shaped like an ellipse). The
   shape will turn white and there should be a small dot in the center of
   the ellipse.

<P><LI>Click the small dot in the center and drag it to the edge of the
   graph at the point where the line normally meets the edge. (If the
   invisible PowerPoint grid is on you may have to hold down the ALT key
   in order to drag precisely to the edge of the ellipse.)

<P><LI>Release the mouse button.

<P><LI>Click away from the chart.
<P>
</OL><h3>PowerPoint 3.0 for the Macintosh</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Select the chart in Slide view.

<P><LI>On the Arrange menu, click Ungroup. WARNING:  This will break
   the link between the chart and the datasheet, and you will no longer
   be able to edit the chart in Microsoft Graph.

<P><LI>Click away from the chart so that no objects are selected.

<P><LI>Click the line.

<P><LI>Press the DEL key.

<P><LI>There may be two lines. If this is the case, repeat steps 4 and 5
   to delete the remaining line.
