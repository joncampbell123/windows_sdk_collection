<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In charting, a series is one row or column of data used to draw one or more
graphic elements on the chart; for example, one bar, line, or pie slice.
What you type into the first row and column of cells and which orientation
you choose (series in rows or series in columns) affect how the data is
plotted on the chart. The default Graph chart is plotted with series
in rows.
<P>
<PRE>          1st Qtr  2nd Qtr  3rd Qtr  4th Qtr
   East      20.4     27.4     90.4     20.4
   West      30.6     38.6     34.6     31.6
   North     45.9     46.9     45       43.9

</PRE>In the example above, if you chose Series In Columns from the
Datasheet menu, Graph would have plotted East, West, and North
as the X axis, rather than the quarters.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To plot series in rows, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Type series names in the first column and labels in the first
   row of the datasheet.

<P><LI>Choose Series in Rows from the Datasheet menu if it isn't
   already selected. A checkmark appears next to the current
   selection in the menu.
<P>
</OL>The text down the first column of the datasheet will appear on the
legend as series names. The text in the first row will appear on
the horizontal axis of the chart as tick mark labels.
<P>
To plot series in columns, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Type the labels in the first column and the series names in
   the first row.

<P><LI>Choose Series In Columns from the Datasheet menu if it isn't
   already selected. A checkmark appears next to the current
   selection in the menu.
<P>
</OL>The text across the first row of the datasheet will appear on the
legend as series names. The text in the first column will appear on
the horizontal axis of the chart as tick mark labels.
