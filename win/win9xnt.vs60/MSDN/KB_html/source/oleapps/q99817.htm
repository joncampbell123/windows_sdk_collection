<P><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft ClipArt Gallery objects on PowerPC 603- or 604-based Power
Macintosh computers may appear as gray hashed boxes instead of the
selected ClipArt Gallery images. This problem may be related to the
status of the Modern Memory Manager.
<P>
The ClipArt Gallery 1.1a Patch included with this Application Note
allows Microsoft ClipArt Gallery to function with Modern Memory
Manager active on a Power Macintosh with the PowerPC 603 chip and with
Modern Memory Manager disabled on a Power Macintosh with the 604 chip.
<P>
For a more comprehensive description of Modern Memory Manager and the
related ClipArt Gallery issues, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
