The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Equation Editor version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Equation Editor, shipped with Microsoft Word for Windows
version 2.0, does not indicate what font was used previously with a
particular part of an equation. Instead, it uses the current value of
the styles set in the Equation Editor.
<P>
In addition, the Equation Editor does not prompt you to save changes
in an equation object if it is loaded into the editor when a different
set of styles are active than those used when the equation object was
created. This may cause some confusion when editing and printing the
equation, since the fonts that print and display will not match what
is described by the style definitions in Equation Editor.
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
To have the equation reflect the new style definition, choose Update
from the Equation Editor's File menu before you choose Exit And
Return. This changes the equation in the document to match the
settings in the Style Define dialog box of the Equation Editor.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Equation Editor
version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here as it becomes available.

<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the Insert menu, choose Object. Select Equation and choose
    the OK button.

<P><LI>Type some text in the Equation Editor window. From the Style menu,
    choose Define.

<P><LI>For the Text style, select the Courier font and choose the OK
    button.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Exit And Return. Choose the Yes button
    when prompted to save the equation in the Word document.

<P><LI>Position the insertion point in a new paragraph. From the Insert
    menu, choose Object. Select Equation and choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Type some text in the Equation Editor window. From the Style menu,
    choose Define.

<P><LI>For the Text style, choose the Helv font and choose the OK button.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Exit and Return. Choose the Yes button
    when prompted to save the equation in the Word document.

<P><LI>Double-click the original equation (created in steps 1-4 above) to
    bring the equation into Equation Editor.

<P><LI>From the Style menu, choose Define and check the font of the Text
    style. It should say Helv. Choose the Cancel button.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Exit And Return.
<P>
</OL>In step 10, the font will say Helv and the equation will appear as
Helv. After step 11, the font will still appear as Courier. There will
be no prompt to save changes to the equation.
