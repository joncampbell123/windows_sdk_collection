The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft WordArt, version 2.0
<LI>Microsoft Equation Editor, version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you insert or edit a Microsoft WordArt 2.0 object or a Microsoft
Equation 2.0 object, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The server application, source file, or item cannot be found. Make sure
   the application is properly installed, and that it has not been deleted,
   moved, or renamed.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when you register Microsoft WordArt 2.0 or
Microsoft Equation 2.0 again in the Registration Database file
(REG.DAT). The behavior occurs because the registration files for
these applications, WORDART2.REG and EQNEDIT2.REG, contain incorrect
path information. The WORDART2.REG file contains the following path
information:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;windows dir&gt;\MSAPPS\WORDART\WORDART2.EXE

</PRE>The EQNEDIT2.REG file contains the following path information:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;windows dir&gt;\MSAPPS\EQUATION\EQNEDIT.EXE

</PRE>If you merge the WORDART2.REG file into the REG.DAT file by
double-clicking the filename in File Manager, or by using the Merge
Registration File dialog box in the Registration Info Editor, you can
no longer edit or insert a Microsoft WordArt 2.0 object.
<P>
If you merge the EQNEDIT2.REG file into the REG.DAT file, and your
Microsoft Windows directory is NOT C:\WINDOWS, you can no longer edit
or insert a Microsoft Equation 2.0 object. Note that if your
Microsoft Windows directory is C:\WINDOWS, you do not have this
problem.
<P>
<P>
Note that if you merge the Microsoft Excel 5.0 registration file,
EXCEL5.REG, into the REG.DAT file, you may experience this problem
when you edit or insert a Microsoft Excel 5.0 object. This problem
occurs only if Microsoft Excel is not included in the PATH statement
in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. To correct this problem, start Microsoft
Excel. The full path to Microsoft Excel is automatically registered
in the REG.DAT file when you do this.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Run the Setup program that you used to install the application, such as
   Microsoft Office, and install the application again.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use the following steps to correct the information in the *.REG file,
   and merge the registration file again:
<P>
   1. Open the registration file in a text editor, such as Notepad.
<P>
<P><PRE>      The WordArt registration file, WORDART2.REG, is located in the
      MSAPPS\WORDART subdirectory of your Microsoft Windows directory. The
      Equation registration file, EQNEDIT2.REG is located in the
      MSAPPS\EQUATION subdirectory of your Microsoft Windows directory.
</PRE><P>
   2. Locate the fourth and eighth lines in the WORDART2.REG file, or the
<P><PRE>      sixth, thirteenth and nineteenth lines in the EQNEDIT2.REG file. If
      the equal sign in these lines is followed by "&lt;windows dir&gt;" (without
      the quotation marks) or an incorrect path, replace this with the
      actual path to your Microsoft Windows directory.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      For example, if the 4th line in the WORDART2.REG file (following the
      equal sign) appears as follows
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         &lt;windows dir&gt;\MSAPPS\WORDART\WordArt2.exe

      then modify the line as follows (assuming Windows is installed in
      C:\WIN3):

         C:\WIN3\MSAPPS\WORDART\WORDART2.EXE

   Note, if "&lt;windows dir&gt;" does not appear on the specific line numbers
   listed above, then look for the lines that contain either, without
   quotes, "Eqnedit.exe" or "Wordart2.exe", in the respective .reg files.

   3. Save the changes and exit the text editor.

   4. In File Manager, double-click the registration file that you edited
      above, WORDART2.REG or EQNEDIT2.REG. A dialog box will appear with
      the message that the registration information has been successfully
      registered in the registration database.
