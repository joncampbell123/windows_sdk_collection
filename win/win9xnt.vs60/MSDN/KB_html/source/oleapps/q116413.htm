</PRE><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
When you run ClipArt Gallery, it may fail and then generate the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The ClipArt Gallery cannot create an index file. You may not have
   permission to create files on this disk or you may be having
   hardware problems.

</PRE>This problem occurs if both of the following conditions exist:

<UL><LI>Windows is installed to and run from a root directory.

<LI>Your WIN.COM file is located in a root directory on your hard disk
   drive, or WIN.COM is located in a virtual network connection that
   appears to be the root directory when you connect to it from your
   workstation.
<P>
</UL>The files included with this Application Note, ARTGALRY.EXE, CTL3DV2.DLL,
and PICSTORE.DLL, correct this problem.
<P>
<P><h3>To replace your ARTGALRY.EXE file</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Insert the enclosed GE1031 disk in the appropriate floppy disk
   drive.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following command and press
   ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;:\artgalry.exe &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the GE1031 disk
   and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory where your
   ARTGALRY.EXE file currently resides. For example, if ARTGALRY.EXE
   is located in the MSAPPS\ARTGALRY subdirectory on network drive X
   and the GE1031 disk is in drive A, type the following command and
   press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\artgalry.exe x:\msapps\artgalry
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: You must have the necessary network privileges to replace
   this file on the network.
<P>
</OL><h3>To install (or replace) CTL3DV2.DLL and PICSTORE.DLL</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Insert the enclosed GE1031 disk in the appropriate floppy disk
   drive.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following command and press
   ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;:\*.dll &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the GE1031 disk
   and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory where your Windows
   system files are located. If you are running a stand-alone
   installation of Windows, &lt;destination&gt; will be the SYSTEM
   subdirectory of your Windows directory. If you are running a shared
   installation of Windows, &lt;destination&gt; will be the directory where
   the shared Windows files are located. For example, if your stand-
   alone Windows system files are located in the SYSTEM subdirectory
   of the WINDOWS directory on drive X and the GE1031 disk is in drive
   A, type the following command and press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\*.dll x:\windows\system
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: You must have the necessary network privileges to replace
   these files on the network.
