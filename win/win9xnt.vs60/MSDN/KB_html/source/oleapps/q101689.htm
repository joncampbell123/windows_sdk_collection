<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Publisher 2.0 includes the Microsoft ClipArt Gallery. ClipArt Gallery is an
OLE source (server) application that categorizes and provides thumbnails
(preview images) of all the clip art included with Publisher. You can use
ClipArt Gallery as a source application with any OLE destination (client)
application.
<P>
You can edit the preview menus in ClipArt Gallery to remove unwanted
graphics or to add new graphics of your own. Using ClipArt Gallery, you can
categorize and access all the graphic files on your computer, including
clip art provided with other applications or from graphics you have made
yourself. You can use any graphics in ClipArt Gallery for which Publisher
has an import filter.
<P>
NOTE: ClipArt Gallery cannot create or display thumbnails of Encapsulated
PostScript (EPS) graphics that do not contain image display headers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>

<UL><LI>Importing Graphics in Publisher
<LI>Importing Graphics in Word for Windows
<LI>Adding Other Graphics to ClipArt Gallery
<LI>Automatically Updating all Preview Images
<LI>Removing Unwanted Preview Images

</UL>NOTE: In addition to being able to perform the functions covered in this

<P>
<P><h3>Importing Graphics in Publisher</h3>
 
<P>
To import a graphic in Publisher:

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, choose ClipArt Gallery.

<P><LI>Choose the category of clip art images you want to view.

<P><LI>Click the graphic you want to import and choose OK.
<P>
</OL>The graphic appears on your page.
<P>
<P><h3>Importing Graphics in Word for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
You can use ClipArt Gallery from Word for Windows and other OLE client
applications. To use ClipArt Gallery to import graphics into your Word for
Windows version 2.0 document:

<OL><P><LI>From the Insert menu, choose Object.

<P><LI>In the Insert Object dialog box, select Microsoft ClipArt
   Gallery and choose OK.

<P><LI>Choose the category of clip art images you want to view.

<P><LI>Click the graphic you want to import and choose OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Adding Other Graphics to ClipArt Gallery</h3>
 
<P>
To add preview images for other graphics to ClipArt Gallery:

<OL><P><LI>Launch ClipArt Gallery.

<P><LI>In the ClipArt Gallery dialog box, choose Options.

<P><LI>In the Options dialog box, choose Add.

<P><LI>In the Add ClipArt dialog box, locate and select the graphic you
   want to add, and choose OK.

<P><LI>Choose a category from the list or type the name of a new one. Type
   a descriptive name for the graphic, and choose Add.

<P><LI>The preview of the graphic appears in the category you selected.
   The preview images appear in alphabetical order based on the
   filenames of the graphics.
<P>
</OL><h3>Automatically Updating All Preview Images</h3>
 
<P>
If you delete or install many graphics, you may want to update the preview
images without having to do each one individually. ClipArt Gallery can
search your hard drive and automatically add preview images for the
graphics you have, and remove preview images for graphics that have been
deleted. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Run ClipArt Gallery.

<P><LI>In the ClipArt Gallery dialog box, choose Options.

<P><LI>In the Options dialog box, choose Refresh.

<P><LI>In the Refresh dialog box, specify the drive(s) you want to search
   and choose OK.
<P>
</OL>ClipArt Gallery adds preview images for new graphics and removes images for
graphics that have been deleted.
<P>
<P><h3>Deleting Unwanted Preview Images</h3>
 
<P>
You can also delete specific preview images that you no longer want. Doing
this does not remove the graphic file itself from your hard drive. To
delete a selected preview image, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Launch ClipArt Gallery.

<P><LI>Click the preview image you want to remove.

<P><LI>Press the DEL key.

<P><LI>ClipArt Gallery asks you if you if you want to remove this
   thumbnail image. Choose Yes.
<P>
</OL>ClipArt Gallery removes the preview.
<P>
