The information in this article applies to:

</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you use OLE automation in a Microsoft document, you may receive OLE
error messages if any of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You have a conflicting extension file in the Extensions folder.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>The system is unable to locate the Microsoft OLE Extension file (the
   Microsoft OLE Library file if you are using a Power Macintosh).
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>You do not have enough available memory for the system to access the
   file.
<P>
</UL>To use OLE functionality with Microsoft applications, the Microsoft
OLE Extension file (the Microsoft OLE Library file if you are using a
Power Macintosh) must be located in the Extensions folder, which is
located in the System Folder.
<P>
NOTE: If the Microsoft OLE Extension file has been moved to a different
folder, you must return it to the Extensions folder. If the file is missing
(that is, it has been removed from your hard disk), you must reinstall the
Microsoft application to reinstall the file.
<P>
This article discusses how the Microsoft OLE Extension file is loaded, and
it also describes ways you can optimize your Macintosh in order to use this
file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>How the Microsoft OLE Extension File Is Loaded</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft OLE Extension file (the Microsoft OLE Library file if you are
using a Power Macintosh) is loaded when you run a Microsoft application;
however, this file is not loaded into the application's allocated memory.
Instead, because it is an extension, it is loaded by the system software.
<P>
Note that holding down the SHIFT key to start your computer with extensions
off does not disable the Microsoft OLE Extension.
<P>
Once the Microsoft application is started, your computer must have an
additional unused memory block of the size specified in the table
below if you want to be able to use OLE functionality.
<P>
The table below specifies the minimum amount of unused memory
required for your type of computer to load the Microsoft OLE
Extension (or Microsoft OLE Library) file.
<P>
<PRE>   For this type
   of Macintosh           Virtual Memory Off     Virtual Memory On
   ---------------------------------------------------------------

   680x0 (Not a                400K                 400K
   Power Macintosh)

   Power Macintosh            2048K                 300K

</PRE>Note that more memory will be required if you are using an OLE server
such as Clip Art Gallery or Microsoft Graph. This memory will also be
taken from the largest unused block of memory.
<P>
<P><h3>How You Can Optimize Your Macintosh to Use the Microsoft OLE Extension File</h3>
 
<P>
If there is not enough memory to load the Microsoft OLE Extension, close
any currently open non-essential applications, turn on virtual memory, or
reduce the amount of memory allocated to the Microsoft application.
<P>
To close any currently open non-essential applications, select the
application, and choose Quit from the File menu.
<P>
To turn on virtual memory:

<OL><P><LI>From the Apple menu, choose Control Panels, and choose the Memory
   Control Panel.

<P><LI>Change the Virtual Memory setting to On. [You may also need to set
   the 32-bit Addressing setting to On in order to access more than
   8 megabytes (MB) of RAM.]

<P><LI>Close the Memory Control Panel and restart your Macintosh.
<P>
</OL>To reduce the amount of memory allocated to the Microsoft application:

<OL><P><LI>To determine the amount of memory your application must be allocated so
   that the system can load the Microsoft OLE Extension (OLE Library if you
   are using a Power Macintosh), switch to the Finder and choose About This
   Macintosh from the Apple menu. Note the number in the largest unused
   block field on the right side of the dialog box.

<P><LI>From the table in the "How the Microsoft OLE Extension File Is Loaded"
   section of this article, determine the amount of memory your computer
   needs to load the Microsoft OLE Extension file (or OLE Library).
   Subtract this number from the number listed in the Largest Unused Block
   field of the About This Macintosh dialog box. The result is the largest
   amount of memory that can be allocated to the Microsoft application.

<P><LI>To change the amount of memory allocated to an application, in the
   Finder, locate the application icon, and click on it once to select it.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Get Info.

<P><LI>In the Microsoft &lt;Application Name&gt; Info dialog box, under Memory, In
   the Preferred (or Current) Size field, type a value greater than the
   Minimum size shown, but less than the result of step 2, above.
