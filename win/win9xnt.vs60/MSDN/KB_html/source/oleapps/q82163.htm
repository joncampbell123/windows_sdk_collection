<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the differences and similarities between mini and
full OLE servers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
An OLE server, also referred to as source application, is responsible for
providing and manipulating the data component. Servers can either be mini
servers or full servers. Both mini and full servers support embedded
components; however, only full servers support both embedding and linking.
<P>
Mini servers appear more like a dialog box, and in some cases there is no
distinction. Usually, they are applications that can only be launched from
a host application, and will display an error message if started from File
Manager or Program Manager. Mini servers only support embedded components
(and not linked components) because they don't have the ability to save
files to disk. Examples of mini servers are Microsoft WordArt, Microsoft
Note-It, and Microsoft Draw.
<P>
Full servers are stand-alone applications with a full compliment of menus
and functions. Although they support OLE functions, they don't need a host
application to run. Full servers may be either single document interface
(SDI) applications that only allow one document to be opened at a time,
such as Paintbrush, or multiple document interface applications (MDI) that
allow editing of multiple documents at a time, such as Microsoft Excel and
Microsoft Word for Windows.
