The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Graph for Windows, version 3.0b
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Text attached to the X, Y, or Z axis of a chart created in Microsoft
Graph version 3.0b may appear distorted when the chart is embedded in
any OLE client application. This distortion occurs when all the
following requirements are met:

<UL><LI>The target printer driver in the client application is version
<P><PRE>    31.V1.08 of the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 4 driver.
</PRE>
<LI>The text orientation involves rotating each character 90 degrees.

<LI>The font selected is one of the TrueType or vector fonts that
   ships with Windows version 3.1.

<LI>The graph has been edited and updated at least twice.
<P>
</UL>Microsoft Graph version 3.0b ships with Microsoft PowerPoint version
3.0 for Windows.
<P>
To work around this problem, format the text with any other TrueType
font, aside from those that originally shipped with Windows 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This font distortion may appear as a font remapping or in some cases
text may disappear altogether.
<P>
After you first create a graph with the above characteristics, you can
embed the object in the client application properly. However, if you
subsequently edit and update that object, the distortion appears.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open any OLE client application on a system that has Microsoft
    Graph version 3.0b installed.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Print Setup.

<P><LI>Select the LaserJet 4 version 31.V1.08 driver.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Insert Object.

<P><LI>Select Microsoft Graph Object.

<P><LI>In the Chart window, click the X axis.

<P><LI>From the Format menu, choose Text.

<P><LI>Select either of the two orientations that involve rotating each
    character 90 degrees and choose the OK button.

<P><LI>With the X axis still selected, choose Font from the Format menu,
    change to any of the original Windows 3.1 TrueType or vector
    fonts, and choose the OK button.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Exit And Return To &lt;DocumentName&gt;.

<P><LI>Once the updated embedded Graph object appears in the client
    application, double-click it to invoke a second editing session of
    the object.
<P>
    The text attached to the X axis now appears distorted.
<P>
</OL>Updating this graph object to the client application causes the
distortion to appear there as well.
