The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Macintosh, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you insert an object into Microsoft Word 6.0, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Word cannot complete the current operation because the Microsoft
   OLE Extension is missing or there is insufficient memory to use
   it.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs when there is an extension conflict, or when either of
the following is true:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft OLE Extension is missing, or has been moved out of the
   Extensions folder.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>There is not enough memory to load the Microsoft OLE Library.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>If the Microsoft OLE Extension is missing, or has been moved</h3>
 
<P>
If the Microsoft OLE Extension file has been moved to a different folder
or has been removed from the hard disk, the file must either be returned
to the Extensions folder in the System folder, or you must reinstall the
Microsoft application.
<P>
To reinstall the application:

<OL><P><LI>In the Word folder, double-click on the Microsoft Word Setup
   icon. If you have an integrated installation of Microsoft Office,
   double-click on the Microsoft Office Setup icon in the Microsoft Office
   folder.

<P><LI>Click on Reinstall to repeat the last installation, which restores
   missing files and settings.
<P>
</OL><h3>If there is not enough memory to load the Microsoft OLE Extension</h3>
 
<P>
If there is not enough memory to load the Microsoft OLE Extension, close
any currently open non-essential applications, turn on virtual memory, or
reduce the amount of memory allocated to Word.
<P>
For more information about optimizing memory for OLE applications, please
see the following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../oleapps/q121595.htm">Q121595</A></B>
   TITLE     : "OLE: Optimizing Memory Allocation for Use with OLE
                Documents"

</PRE></OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft OLE Extension is loaded when you run a Microsoft application,
but it is not loaded into the application's allocated memory. Instead,
because it is an extension, it is loaded by the system software. The
largest unused block of memory must be at least 400K after the application
loads in order for enough memory to be available for the Microsoft OLE
Extension. In addition to the memory required for the Microsoft OLE
Extension, when an OLE server is used, such as Clip Art Gallery or
Microsoft Graph, more memory is required. This memory will be taken from
the largest unused block.
<P>
For information about other OLE error messages, please see the following
