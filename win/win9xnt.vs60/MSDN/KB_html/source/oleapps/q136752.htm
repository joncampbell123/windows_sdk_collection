<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
ClipArt Gallery 2.0 uses a file called Artgalry.cag to contain the
thumbnails and descriptions of the separate pictures registered in the
ClipArt Gallery. Each ClipArt Gallery 2.0 user must be able to modify a
copy of Artgalry.cag. This means that you cannot put a single copy of
Artgalry.cag on a network server for multiple users.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you give Artgalry.cag a read-only attribute to allow multiple people to
use it, you will receive the following error message when you try to start
ClipArt Gallery:
<P>
<PRE>   The ClipArt Gallery cannot run because the database file has
   been marked read-only.

   Use File Manager or Explorer to locate ARTGALRY.CAG, and remove
   the read-only file property.

</PRE>If you don't give Artgalry.cag a read-only attribute and more than one
person tries to use ClipArt Gallery simultaneously, the second user
receives the following message when they try to start ClipArt Gallery:
<P>
<PRE>   The ClipArt Gallery is already running

</PRE>This behavior is by design. Even if ClipArt gallery could start with a read-
only Artgalry.cag, many of its features would not work. It would be
impossible to add, delete or move thumbnail images. It would also be
impossible to change the descriptions of the pictures or the names of
categories.
