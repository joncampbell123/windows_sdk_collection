The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Equation Editor versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.01, 3.00
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In the Microsoft Word for Windows Equation Editor, if you enter
caption text or a second equation below a fraction, the first equation
may extend to the right if you use an incorrect procedure to begin the
next line.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
It is important to watch the position and size of the insertion point
in the Equation Editor because these characteristics change depending
on the part of the equation you are working with. The ENTER key
normally moves the insertion point down one line; however, pressing
ENTER after certain equations causes unexpected results.
<P>
For example, if you want to add a caption below an equation that ends
with a fraction, you would normally press the ENTER key after typing
the equation to move to the next line. However, as you type the
caption text, the fraction bar extends to the right. The numerator
also moves to the right, remaining centered over the fraction bar. The
denominator remains in its original position. To avoid this problem,
make sure that the flashing insertion bar is to the right of the
equation and that it displays with the full height of the first
equation before you press ENTER.
<P>
NOTE: To move forward and backward through an equation, use the TAB
key and SHIFT+TAB key combination.
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the Insert menu, choose Object.

<P><LI>Select Equation from the list box. Choose the OK button.

<P><LI>From the Template Palette, choose the Fraction Template button, or
   press CTRL+F.

<P><LI>Press 1, press the TAB key, and then press 2. The fraction
   "one-half" should now appear in the Equation Editor window.

<P><LI>Press the TAB key once. Notice that the insertion point moved to
   the right and now appears full-line height. Pressing the TAB key
   disconnects the insertion point from the Fraction template.

<P><LI>Press the ENTER key, and type "Fraction" (without the quotation
   marks).
<P>
</OL>The fraction bar does not extend to the right in response to the
typing.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Perform steps 1 through 4 from the Workaround section above.

<P><LI>Press the ENTER key, and type "Fraction" (without the quotation
   marks).
<P>
</OL>The numerator and fraction bar extend to the right as you type the
word.
