The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Draw version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Word for Windows version 2.0, double-clicking on an
inserted picture that is positioned next to another picture on the
same line without a space between the two pictures fails to activate
Microsoft Draw if the pictures were inserted using the following
method.
<P>
To edit the second picture in Microsoft Draw, use one of the
following methods:

<UL><LI>Insert a space between the two pictures, and double-click the second
   picture to launch Microsoft Draw. After you close Microsoft Draw,
   delete the space; Microsoft Draw now launches whenever you
   double-click the second picture.
<P>
  -or-

<LI>Select the second picture, and choose Picture from the Edit menu.
   Microsoft Draw launches and you can edit the picture. Microsoft Draw
   now launches whenever you double-click the second picture.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Following the specific steps below results in the failure of Microsoft
Draw to launch when you double-click the second picture. Microsoft
Draw does launch if you double-click the first picture.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the Insert menu, choose Object, and select Microsoft Drawing
   to start Microsoft Draw (ALT, I, O, Microsoft Drawing). Choose the OK
   button.

<P><LI>From the Microsoft Draw File menu, choose Import Picture (ALT, F,
   I). Choose a graphic file from the CLIPART subdirectory to use as an
   example.

<P><LI>Exit Microsoft (ALT, F, X). Choose Yes to update your Word
   document.

<P><LI>Do not move the insertion point. From the Insert menu, choose
   Picture (ALT, I, P). Select another picture from the CLIPART
   subdirectory, and choose the OK button.
<P>
   The pictures will appear side-by-side with no space between them.

<P><LI>Double-click the second picture you inserted. Microsoft Draw does
   not launch.
<P>
</OL>Note: This problem does not occur if you use the Insert Picture
command twice for adjacent pictures or if you use Microsoft Draw twice
for embedding adjacent pictures. The problem only occurs if you use
Microsoft Draw for inserting the first picture and Insert Picture the
second picture.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Word for Windows
version 2.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here as it becomes available.
