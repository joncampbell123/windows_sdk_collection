<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To install and run any of the programs included with Microsoft Office
97 under Windows NT Workstation, your computer must have the following
service pack(s) installed:
<P>
<PRE>                                                 Service
   Version of Windows NT                   Pack Required
   -----------------------------------------------------
   Windows NT Workstation, version 3.51   Service Pack 5
   Windows NT Workstation, version 4.0    Service Pack 2

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Service Pack 5 for Windows NT 3.51 provides additional functionality to
Windows NT version 3.51, including enhanced Internet functionality and an
updated Oleaut32.dll file. These features are required in order for
Microsoft Office 97 programs to work under Windows NT version 3.51.
<P>
Service Pack 2 for Windows NT 4.0 corrects some operating system problems
that could affect Microsoft Office 97 programs. If you receive any error
messages (such as application errors) when running Microsoft Office 97
programs, it is strongly recommended that you download and install Service
Pack 2.
<P>
The box for Microsoft Office 97, Service Release 1 (SR-1), may incorrectly
state the service pack requirement for Microsoft Office 97 SR-1. Microsoft
Office 97 SR-1 requires Service Pack 2 in order to run under Microsoft
Windows NT Workstation, version 4.0. In addition, the box may not state
that the version of Microsoft Office 97 included in the box is SR-1.
<P>
When you perform an administrative installation (Setup /a) of Microsoft
Office 97, Microsoft Office 97 SR-1, or any of the Microsoft Office 97
programs to a server running Microsoft Windows NT Server, it is not
necessary to install Service Pack 5 or Service Pack 2 on the workstation
from which you are performing the administrative installation, or on the
server. Service packs are required only when you perform a client
installation on the workstation that actually runs the Microsoft Office
programs.
<P>

   Office 97. Please check the minimum requirements on the packaging or
   in the readme file for your product. The readme files are located in the

   -or-

   Office 97. Service Pack 5.0 or higher is required for NT3.51. Service
   Pack 2.0 or higher is required for NT4.
