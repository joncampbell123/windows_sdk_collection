The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Equation Editor for Windows, version 2.1
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You cannot paste all or part of one equation editor object into another
equation editor object.
<P>
When you copy part of one equation using the shortcut menu, the entire
equation pastes into the new equation object, even though you copied only a
portion of the original equation. If you type part of your equation before
you choose paste, your equation will be overwritten by the paste operation.
<P>
This problem does not occur when you copy and paste part of an equation
object into the current equation object.
<P>
This functionality is different from previous versions of Word where you
are able to copy and paste portions of one equation object into
another.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because Equation Editor is closed when you deactivate
the equation object. In contrast, in previous versions of Word, the
Equation Editor remains open in the background. This functionality was
changed to improve resource usage while Equation Editor is running.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Word for Windows 95
version 7.0. Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Start the Equation Editor independent of another program, switch between
Word and Equation Editor to piece together your equation, and then paste
the equation back into the document in the other program (for example,
paste the equation back into your Word document).
