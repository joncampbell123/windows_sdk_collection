<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The first time you try to insert clipart using Microsoft ClipArt
Gallery for Windows, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   ClipArt Gallery: Cannot Create Index File

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The three main causes of this error are described below.
<P>
<P><h3>Cause 1: A Lack of Free Disk Space for Modifying the Artgalry.idx File</h3>
 
<P>
In File Manager, check the amount of free space on the hard disk. Make sure
there is at least 5 megabytes (MB) of available space on the hard disk.
(This is not the amount of space required for the index file (.idx), but it
does help Windows run more reliably.)
<P>
<P><h3>Cause 2: Invalid Paths to the .icx Files in C:\Windows\Artgalry.ini</h3>
 
<P>
Use Notepad to view the Artgalry.ini file. Make sure that the path
for each entry in the Artgalry.ini file is valid. For example, if the
[Import] section of the Artgalry.ini file includes the entry
<P>
<PRE>   File=C:\Winapps\Works3\,&lt;collection&gt;.idx,...

</PRE>where &lt;collection&gt;.idx is the name of the index and thumbnail files
associated with a collection of clip art graphics files, such as the
ones that ship with several Microsoft products. For example, an entry
for Microsoft Works might look like:
<P>
<PRE>   File=C:\Winapps\Works3\,Wks3art.idx, Wks3art.thm,...

</PRE>Make sure the path is correct for all the file names in the [Import] section of
the Artgalry.ini file, especially the line that has the name of the index file
that appears in the error message.
<P>
Cause 3: A Corrupted &lt;collection&gt;.idx or Artgalry.idx...
 
<P>
To establish whether or not an .IDX file is corrupted, use Notepad to edit
the C:\Windows\Artgalry.ini file. In the [Import] section, you should find
the following entry:
<P>
<PRE>   File=C:\Msworks\Clipart\,&lt;collection&gt;.idx,&lt;collection&gt;.thm,...

</PRE>where &lt;collection&gt;.idx is the name of the index file that appears in the
error message.
<P>
Place a semicolon (;) at the front of this line (for example, ;File=c:) to
disable it. Save the file and quit Notepad.
<P>
Now try inserting clip art using ClipArt Gallery. If you do not receive the
error message, the .idx file is probably corrupted, and you will need to
either manually add the clip art images, or remove and then reinstall the
clip art images using the Setup program.
<P>
To manually add the clip art do the following:

<OL><P><LI>In ClipArt Gallery, click Options.

<P><LI>Click Add.

<P><LI>Switch to the directory that contains the clip art graphics. For
   example, the location of the clip art graphics that come with Microsoft
   Works might be the C:\Msworks\Clipart directory.

<P><LI>Click Select All. Click OK.
<P>
</OL>At this point, you are asked whether or not you want to categorize your
clip art. If you click No, the process is much faster, but both options are
valid. The clip art is then added to ClipArt Gallery.
<P>
If the clip art graphics are stored as Picture Store (*.PCS) files, you
will not be able to add the clip art manually and you will have to use the
Setup program for the application that provided the clip art to remove the
clip art that is causing the error and them run Setup again to add the clip
art images back in.
