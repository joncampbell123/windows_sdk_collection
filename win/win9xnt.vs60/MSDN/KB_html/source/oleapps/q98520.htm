The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Draw versions 1.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0 and 3.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to import a picture into Microsoft Draw, you may receive
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Sorry, there are too many filters installed under
   [MS Graphic Import Filters] section in WIN.INI. This section
   will be ignored.

</PRE>Draw supports a maximum of 15 graphic filters. If more than 15 are
installed, the above error message occurs.
<P>
To eliminate this error message, you can reduce the number of graphic
filters installed by modifying the WIN.INI file with the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu in Program Manager, choose Run.

<P><LI>In the Command Line box, type "sysedit" (without the quotation
   marks) and press ENTER.

<P><LI>Bring the WIN.INI file to the front by clicking its title bar or
   choosing it from the Window menu.

<P><LI>From the Search menu, choose Find.

<P><LI>In the Find box, type "ms graphic import" (without the quotation
   marks) and press ENTER.

<P><LI>Look for lines in the [MS Graphic Import Filters] section that
   correspond to graphic filters that are either not needed or are
   duplicates.
<P>
   Note: These lines can be removed completely, or you can comment them
   out by placing a semicolon (;) at the beginning of each line you want
   ignored.

<P><LI>When you have reduced the number of filters to 15 or fewer, choose
   Save from the File menu, and then choose Exit.
<P>
   You must restart Microsoft Draw for these changes to take effect. It
   is not necessary to restart Windows or the application you are using
   with Draw.
