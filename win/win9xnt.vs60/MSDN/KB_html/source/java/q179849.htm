The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual J++, versions 1.0, 1.1
<LI>SDK for Java, versions 2.0, 2.01
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Connectable objects are COM objects that use a standard COM mechanism for
notifying clients that something has occurred or changed. ActiveX controls
and Automation objects use this mechanism to fire "events." Developer
environments such as Visual Basic and Visual C++ have built-in support for
these events.
<P>
The Microsoft SDK 2.0 for Java gives Java client developers the ability to
use these connectable objects and receive their events.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A connectable object is a COM object that implements the interface
IConnectionPointContainer. A client application calls
IConnectionPointContainer-&gt;FindConnectionPoint() to ask the object if it
supports a specific type of connection which is defined by a unique COM
interface and ID. If the object supports that connection type, the result
is a pointer to an IConnectionPoint interface that represents that specific
connection type.
<P>
Now that the client application has the object's IConnectionPoint interface
for a specific type of connection, the client can instruct the object to
add the client as a recipient for the connection's outgoing calls.
<P>
To do this, the client application has to create a "sink" object, which is
just a COM object that implements the unique COM interface used by this
connection. The client then calls IConnectionPoint-&gt;Advise() and passes its
sink to the connectable object. The object gives the client a value called
a "cookie" that represents this connection.
<P>
When the connectable object needs to notify the client application that
some event has occurred, it makes a call to the interface that is
implemented on the clients "sink" object.
<P>
Later, when the client wants to disconnect from the object, the client
calls IConnectionPoint-&gt;Unadvise() and passes in the "cookie."
<P>
Fortunately for Java developers, the Microsoft SDK for Java 2.0 makes this
process much simpler. To attach a client written in Java to a connectable
object, you must first make the "sink" by creating a Java class that
implements the COM interface defined in the objects type library. Once you
have created an instance of this "sink" class, you will use the
com.ms.com.ConnectionPointCookie class to make the "connection" between
your sink and the connectable object. All calls to the sink occur in the
methods defined on the COM interface.
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: In order to compile the following code, you MUST use the latest Java
compiler included in SDK 2.0 or later (Jvc.exe version 1.02.4337 or above).
The version of the compiler included with Visual J++ and SDK 1.5 will not
work with the source produced by JActiveX.exe. For information on about
using the new Java compiler with Visual J++, see the REFERENCES section of
this document.
<P>
To demonstrate this, use the Internet Explorer 4.0 COM object. Internet
Explorer fires "events," or calls to a "sink" object connected to it. Since
Internet Explorer's type information includes the description of the
interface Internet Explorer uses as a sink, you need to convert the type
information into Java classes by using the JActiveX.exe tool.
<P>
Open a command prompt and set the current directory to
C:\&lt;WINDIR&gt;\SYSTEM[32]\. Make sure that the SDK-JAVA.20\BIN directory is in
the PATH, then type:
<P>
<PRE>   JACTIVEX.EXE SHDOCVW.DLL

</PRE>This produces a directory and many files under C:\&lt;WINDIR&gt;\JAVA\TRUSTLIB\.
The directory name is "Shdocvw" and the files that you need to know about
follow:

<UL><LI>InternetExplorer.java
<LI>IWebBrowser2.java
<LI>DWebBrowserEvents2.java
<P>
</UL>These files are the wrapper classes for the Internet Explorer 4.0 COM
object and its interfaces. Notice the DWebBrowserEvents2.java file. This
source file contains the interface definition for the sink required to
connect to Internet Explorer 4.0. The methods on the interface represent
the events that Internet Explorer "fires." This sink has many methods. The
two that we are concerned with for this sample are StatusTextChange(String
Text) and OnQuit(). In order for a program to receive Internet Explorer's
events, you need to create a class that implements this interface.
<P>
Below is an application that implements the DWebBrowserEvents2 interface:
<P>
<PRE>   import java.awt.*;
   import java.awt.event.*;
   import com.ms.activeX.*;
   import com.ms.com.*;
   import shdocvw.*;  // Import the IE40 package created by JactiveX.

   public class JavaConnect extends Frame
      implements DWebBrowserEvents2, ActionListener
   {
      IWebBrowser2 browser; // Member to hold IE COM object
      TextField location; // Member on Frame for user to type in URL
      TextArea out; // TextArea on Frame that shows Browser status text
      ConnectionPointCookie cookie; // Cookie that connects your event
                                    // "sink" to the browser

      public static void main(String args[])
      {
         // Create an instance of this class. Resize and show.
         final JavaConnect jc = new JavaConnect();
         jc.addWindowListener(new WindowAdapter() {
           public void windowClosing(WindowEvent e)
           {
              if (jc.browser != null)
                 jc.browser.Quit();
           }
         });
         jc.setSize(400,400);
         jc.show();
      }

      public JavaConnect()
      {
         // Create an instance of IE and make it visible
         browser = (IWebBrowser2)new InternetExplorer();
         browser.setVisible(true);

         // Create a ConnectionPoint between the browser
         // and our DWebBrowserEvents2 interface
         cookie = new ConnectionPointCookie(browser, this,
                      shdocvw.DWebBrowserEvents2.class);

         // Create a Panel for the Button and TextField
         Panel northPanel = new Panel();
         northPanel.setLayout(new BorderLayout());

         // Create a Button, add yourself as its ActionListener
         // and add it to the Panel
         Button nav = new Button("Navigate");
         nav.addActionListener(this);
         northPanel.add("West", nav);

         // Create a TextField and add it to the Panel
         location = new TextField();
         northPanel.add("Center", location);

         // Add Panel to Frame
         add("North", northPanel);

         // Create a TextArea and add it to the Frame
         out = new TextArea();
         add("Center", out);
      }

      // ***********************************************************

         // parameters of the Navigate2 method
         Variant optional = new Variant();
         optional.noParam();

         // Call Navigate2 on IE
         browser.Navigate2(new Variant(location.getText()),
                               optional, optional, optional, optional);
      }

      public void StatusTextChange(String Text)
      {
         // The status bar information has changed.
         // Append this new status text to the TextArea.
         out.append(Text+"\n");
      }

</PRE>In the constructor, create a ConnectionPointCookie.  The constructor
parameters should be based on the following:

<UL><LI>The COM object that is a connectable object
<LI>A Java object that implements the sink interface
<LI>The Class object that represents the sink interface
<P>
</UL>In this application's case, you called ConnectionPointCookie(browser, this,
shdocvw.DWebBrowserEvents2.class).
<P>
The ConnectionPointCookie handles all of the COM complexities of attaching
the sink to the correct IConnectionPoint on the connectable object.
<P>
When this application is executed using the following you will see two
windows:
<P>
<PRE>   jview JavaConnect

</PRE>One is a Java Frame that contains a TextField, a Button, and a TextArea.
The other is the Internet Explorer windows. On the Java Frame, enter a URL
in the TextField and click Navigate. You should notice the Internet
Explorer window load the URL you specified. As Internet Explorer loads the
Web page, the Status Bar at the bottom of the browser window changes to
give the user an updated status. This text is also echoed to the Java
application through the event mechanism. The applications
StatusTextChange() method gets called each time. The StatusTextChange
method appends the text to the bottom of the TextArea on the Frame.
<P>
By clicking on the window close button on the Browser, you can send an
OnQuit event to the Java application. The application responds by releasing
the Internet Explorer COM object and quitting.
