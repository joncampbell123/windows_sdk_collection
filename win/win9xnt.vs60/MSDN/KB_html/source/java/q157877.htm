The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual J++, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 requires a protected-mode CD-ROM driver to access the Visual J++
product. If you use a real-mode CD-ROM driver, the following problems
occur:

<UL><LI> Autorun.inf does not execute upon placing the CD in the drive.

<LI>If you try to execute Setup.exe manually by using the Run option on
   the Start menu, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Cannot find the file "drive letter: \setup.exe" (or one of its
      components). Make sure the path and file name are correct and that
      all required libraries are available.
</PRE><P>
   If your path includes a directory where another Setup.exe resides, this
   file is found and executed instead.

<LI>If you try to execute Setup.exe manually by double-clicking on the file
   name in Explorer, you receive the "Program Not Found" dialog box.
<P>
   If your path includes a directory where another Setup.exe resides, this
   file is found and executed instead.

<LI>You cannot open certain folders on the CD, and you receive the following
   error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The folder "drive letter:\foldername" does not exist.
</PRE><P>
   The following folders cannot be opened:
<P>
<P><PRE>      - Cab&amp;Sign
      - Cool Tools
      - MSDev
      - Welcome
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 requires a protected-mode CD-ROM driver to access file names
that do not conform to the 8.3 conventions of MS-DOS.
<P>
Windows 95 can use a real-mode CD-ROM driver to view the CD; however, it
cannot access the files or folders that do not conform to the 8.3
conventions. Real-mode CD-ROM drivers include the following:

<UL><LI>Drivers that must be loaded in the Config.sys file.

<LI>The Microsoft CD-ROM Extensions (MSCDEX) driver (or third-party
   equivalent) that must be loaded in the Autoexec.bat file.
<P>
</UL>The Java language uses long file names and lowercase letters as part of its
naming convention standards--for example, MySampleApplet.java and
MySampleApplet.class. The Visual J++ product, therefore, implements this
naming convention, requiring a protected-mode CD-ROM driver in Windows 95.
<P>
Some CD-ROM drive manufacturers do not provide protected-mode CD-ROM
drivers; therefore, these drives cannot be used with the Visual J++
product.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Using another machine with a protected mode CD-ROM driver in Windows 95 or
Windows NT 4.0, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the complete Visual J++ CD to a network hard drive and install it
   over the network.

<P><LI>Share out the Visual J++ CD-ROM drive and install over the network.

<P><LI>If you are using Windows 95, establish a Direct Cable Connection and
   install over that connection.

<P><LI>If these options are not readily available, installation of a new
   protected mode CD-ROM driver is necessary. Manufacturers are responsible
   for providing protected-mode CD-ROM drivers, some of these drivers are
   available as part of the Windows 95 product.
<P>
</OL>If a compatible protected-mode CD-ROM driver is not available as part of
the Windows 95 product, contact your manufacturer or use an Internet search
engine to find a protected mode CD-ROM driver (suggested keywords: "Windows
95 CD-ROM driver," and your manufacturer's name).
