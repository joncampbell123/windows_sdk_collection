</OL> 
<P>
[1.00] How do I get technical support for Visual J++?
<P>
If you have the retail version of Visual J++, it comes with two free
support incidents included with the purchase of the product. You can call
the VJ++ support number listed under Technical Support from the Help menu
to receive VJ++ support. You can also submit "Web Response" support
incidents via e-mail (see the Visual J++ support Web site at
<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualjsupport/">http://www.microsoft.com/visualjsupport/.</A></B>
<P>
You can also receive peer-to-peer support in the Microsoft public
newsgroups. While we encourage the use of the newsgroups, they are not an
avenue for one-on-one technical support from Microsoft. If you need timely
help directly from Microsoft, please use the technical support phone lines,
or the Web Response e-mail support.
<P>
[1.01] How do I report Visual J++ bugs?
<P>
We appreciate bug reports and product feedback. To report bugs or give us
constructive feedback on Visual J++ you can use the bug reporting Web page
at <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualjsupport/report/report.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/VisualJSupport/report/report.htm.</A></B> You can also
call the Visual J++ technical support line to report bugs. Please note that
phone calls will initially be charged against you as a support incident,
but if we determine that it is a bug, the charge will be canceled.
<P>
[1.03] Why does the MS-DOS Command Prompt window disappear after my Java
application terminates when executed from the Developer Studio IDE?
<P>
"Close on exit" is the default behavior of an MS-DOS Command window.
You can set the properties of your MS-DOS Command windows to not
close on exit and the Command window will remain after your application
terminates. Another option is to have an input statement as the last
statement in your Java application:
<P>
<PRE>   public class Wait
   {
      public static void main(String args[]) throws java.io.IOException
      {
         System.out.println("Hello\n");
         System.in.read();
      }
   }

</PRE></OL>This code causes the Command window to remain until you press
the enter key. This is a useful way to cause the Command window to
remain so that you can see output during the development of your Java
application.
<P>
[1.04] How do I view the error output from my Java applets in Internet
Explorer?
<P>
The file Windows\Java\Javalog.txt contains information about the last
Applet loaded in Internet Explorer. All of the System.out messages and
exception information from the last executed applet is stored in the
Javalog.txt file when Java Logging is enabled in Internet Explorer. Use the
following steps to enable Java Logging:

<OL><P><LI>Start Internet Explorer.

<P><LI>From the View menu, select Options.

<P><LI>Click the Advanced tab.

<P><LI>Select the "Enable Java logging" check box.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Restart Internet Explorer
<P>
</OL>[1.05] I have an applet that I copied from the VJ++ "Getting Started" card.
It runs fine in Internet Explorer but not in Netscape Navigator.
<P>
Navigator requires that the applet class be declared "public." The code
sample supplied on the Getting Started card does not declare the applet
class as public and will not load in the Netscape browser. Add public to
the declaration, and it should run fine in Navigator. The Microsoft Virtual
Machine (VM) version that shipped with Visual J++ does not enforce the
requirement that the applet class be public. The latest versions of the VM
available from <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/java/">http://www.microsoft.com/java/</A></B> do enforce this requirement.
<P>
[1.06] I've installed the latest SDK Developer classes from the Visual J++
Free Downloads page. Now I'm getting java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError from a
simple System.out.println() in a Java Hello World application.
<P>
The SDK Developer Classes came from the latest Microsoft SDK for Java and
are not compatible with older VMs, such as the one shipped with Visual J++
1.0. You can fix this problem by updating your Java VM from
<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/java/">http://www.microsoft.com/java/.</A></B> You should get in the habit of periodically
checking this site and keeping your Java VM as up-to-date as possible. The
Java VM and SDK are updated with bug fixes and new functionality more
frequently than the Visual J++ Development Environment.
<P>
[1.07] I've heard about the Microsoft AFC class library; does it come with
Visual J++ 1.1?
<P>
No, the AFC classes are still under development and are not included with
Visual J++ 1.1. AFC is currently being distributed in the Microsoft SDK for
Java 2.0 preview release at <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/java/">http://www.microsoft.com/java/.</A></B>
<P>
[1.08] Does Visual J++ 1.1 support the new Sun JDK 1.1 language and VM
features?
<P>
No, the VM and class libraries in Visual J++ 1.1 are synched with the
Microsoft SDK for Java version 1.5 (Sun SDK 1.02). However, the VM and
class libraries with the Microsoft SDK 2.0 preview release for Java do
contain Sun JDK 1.1 support. The SDK 2.0 preview can be installed and used
with Visual J++ 1.1 (see the SDK 2.0 release notes). Because the SDK 2.0
preview is beta code and has not been fully tested with Visual J++ 1.1,
Microsoft Technical Support cannot provide you with standard support if you
install the SDK 2.0 preview with Visual J++ 1.1.
<P>
[1.09] I'm using the DialogLayout layout manager created by the Visual J++
Resource Wizard in my Frame class. In the debugger I get an unhandled Java
Exception: "Unhandled exception in java.util.hashtable." Running the
application outside of the debugger causes jview to hang.
<P>
The DialogLayout class generated by the Resource Wizard tries to manipulate
the default Font of the parent Container class. The Frame class does not
have a default Font created for it so this causes the unhandled exception.
You can work around this by creating a Font for the Frame class:
<P>
<PRE>   // File Test.java, requires DialogLayout.java and
  // IDD_DIALOG1.java be created via the Resource Wizard
   import java.awt.*;
   public class Test
   {
      public static void main(String args[])
      {
         Frame frame=new Frame("Test Frame");

         // Resource Wizard generated code does a getFont
         // call, since Frame doesn't have a default font
         // we need to set one.
         Font font=new Font("Dialog",Font.PLAIN,12);
         frame.setFont(font);

         // Create the Wizard generated layout manager
         // with the frame class as parent
         IDD_DIALOG1 myLayout=new IDD_DIALOG1(frame);
         myLayout.CreateControls();

         frame.show();

         // Wait around so we can see the frame created
         // CTRL+C on the jview window to destroy frame
         while(true);
      }
   }

</PRE><P><LI>Installation Questions
</OL> 
<P>
[2.00] The Visual J++ 1.0 Setup program doesn't run, do I have a bad CD-
ROM?
<P>
The Visual J++ CD-ROM was created using the Joliet file system to enable
the use of long file names and file extensions greater than three
characters (.java and .html). Older DOS 16-bit "real mode" CD-ROM device
drivers cannot read the non-8.3 portions of the CD; this requires a 32-bit
protected mode CD- ROM device driver.
<P>
The symptoms you will see if you try and install Visual J++ on a system
with real mode drivers include the following:

<UL><LI>Autorun.inf will not auto-execute setup upon placing the CD in the
   drive.

<LI>If Setup.exe is executed manually by using the Run option from the Start
   menu, the error message "Cannot find the file '[drive
   letter]:\setup.exe' (or one of its components)" appears. Make sure the
   path and filename are correct and that all required libraries are
   available. (NOTE: If the default path in the environment includes a
   directory where another Setup.exe file resides, this file will be found
   and executed instead of the Visual J++ setup).

<LI>If Setup.exe is executed manually by double-clicking on the file name in
   Explorer, the "Program Not Found" dialog box appears. (Note: If the
   default path in the environment includes a directory where another
   Setup.exe file resides, this file will be found and executed instead of
   the Visual J++ setup).

<LI>Certain folders on the CD will not open. Instead, the error message "The
   folder '[drive letter]:\foldername' does not exist" appears. The
   following folders will not open:
<P>
<P><PRE>     Cab&amp;Sign
     Cool Too(ls)
     MSDev
     Welcome
</PRE><P>
</UL>Most hardware/drivers are capable of reading the Visual J++ 1.0 disk;
however, some small percentage of customers are still using real mode
drivers. If you encounter this problem, you should first contact your
system vendor or CD-ROM manufacturer to see if they have an updated
protected mode driver for your hardware.
<P>

<P>
[2.01] How can I tell Visual J++ 1.0 setup to not install Internet
Explorer?
<P>
In certain situations, it can be helpful to install Visual J++ without the
Internet Explorer installation portion of setup being run. For instance, if
you have downloaded the latest version of Internet Explorer and then need
to reinstall Visual J++, you do not want the older version of Internet
Explorer to be installed over your current version (Visual J++ 1.0 setup
does not check the build number of Internet Explorer). You can run the
Visual J++ setup from the \MsDev directory on the CD with the /NOVM option
("D:\msdev\setup /novm") to tell Visual J++ to skip the Internet
Explorer setup portion of Visual J++ setup.
<P>
The Visual J++ 1.1 setup checks the build version of the Internet
Explorer and should not try to update a later version.
<P>
[2.02] I've installed Visual J++ 1.0 and now some of my other Developer
Studio add-ins behave differently.
<P>
Visual J++ 1.0 uses version 4.2 of the Developer Studio shell. If you have
an earlier version of the Developer Studio shell the Visual J++ 1.0 setup
program updates your current IDE components to the Developer Studio 4.2
versions. This can cause some behavior of other Developer Studio add-ins to
change.
<P>
For instance, Visual C++ 4.0 or 4.1 will have some shared components
updated to the Visual C++ 4.2 versions. The compiler will be updated to the
4.2 version and this can cause some changes in behavior. C++ Code that
compiled previously could now give warnings or errors due to the fact that
the C++ compiler has significantly changed due to changes in the ANSI C++
standards. More information can be found in the Knowledge Base article:
<B><A href="../java/q157618.htm">Q157618</A></B>: Installing VJ++ Upgrades Certain VC++ Components
<P>
[2.03] I've installed Visual J++ over the Visual C++ 4.0 Standard Edition
and now things don't work correctly.
<P>
The Visual C++ 4.0 Standard Edition was not designed to be upgradeable in
the same manner as the Visual C++ 4.x Professional Editions. Installing
Visual J++ into the same directory as Visual C++ 4.0 Standard may cause
undefined behavior as the Visual J++ setup updates various Developer Studio
4.0 components to the 4.2 versions. To use Visual C++ 4.0 standard and
Visual J++ together on the same machine, you will need to install them into
separate installation directories. (Note the default behavior is to install
Visual J++ into the same \MSDEV directory as Visual C++).
<P>
[2.04] When I try to start Visual J++ 1.1, I get an error saying "Cannot
load package DEVDTG" because the internal version number does not match the
Developer Studio shell version number. The error message suggests
reinstalling the Developer Studio, which I did, but that didn't fix the
problem.
<P>
This is caused by installing Visual J++ 1.1 (or any other Visual Studio 97
retail product) in the same directory with a previous beta version of the
Developer Studio 97 IDE. The IDE shell checks internal version numbers of
the package files (.PKG files) that it loads at startup. If the version
number of the PKG files do not match the Developer Studio IDE, the IDE will
not load the package.
<P>
The only publicly available Beta of the Developer Studio 97 was installed
with the Site Builder download of Visual InterDev. You should uninstall the
Visual InterDev Beta before installing Visual J++ 1.1 (trial or retail
versions). Visit the Visual InterDev Web site at
<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/vinterdev/">http://www.microsoft.com/vinterdev/</A></B> for instructions on uninstalling the
Visual InterDev Beta. The release version of Visual InterDev has the
proper internal version numbers and coexists with Visual J++ 1.1.
<P>
[2.05] I can't install the Visual J++ 1.1 Trial Edition. After the files
are extracted from Vjtrial.exe I get a DOS box with many "Bad Command or
File Name" errors.
<P>
This can happen on Windows 95 machines if the DOS utility Move.exe is not
on the system path. The Trial install uses the DOS command MOVE to move the
installation files from the temporary extraction directory to a temporary
installation tree before running the Visual J++ installation program. To
fix this problem, make sure that Move.exe exists in the \Windows\Command
directory and that the command directory is on the system path.
<P>
[2.06] I'm trying to install the Visual J++ 1.1 Trial Edition multi-file
download and I can't find the GlueVJ.bat file that's mentioned on the
download Web page.
<P>
GlueVJ.bat is extracted when you "run" the VJTrial4.exe download file. You
need to run the four downloaded .exe files (VJTrial1-VJTrial4), which
create the four pieces of VJTrial.exe as well as GlueVJ.bat. Make sure that
all of these files are in the same directory, then run GlueVJ.bat to merge
the pieces and create VJTrial.exe.

<OL><P><LI>Compiler Questions

<P>
[3.00] There are no compiler questions at this time.

<OL><P><LI>Debugger Questions
</OL> 
<P>
[4.00] I'm not able to restart the Visual J++ 1.0 debugger. After debugging
my application once, the debugger will not restart a second time unless I
exit and restart the Developer Studio.
<P>
This is a bug that can be caused by installing the Visual C++ 4.2
Enterprise Edition in the same directory as Visual J++ 1.0. This bug can be
worked around by renaming the VC++ 4.2 Enterprise package DLL file,
Msvcent.pkg, to some other file name before starting the Developer Studio
while you are doing Visual J++ debugging. Note that this disables the
VC++ Enterprise package and you must rename to file back to Msvcent.pkg and
restart the Developer Studio to re-enable the Enterprise package.
<P>
[4.01] I'm having trouble setting breakpoints in my Java code. Breakpoints
set from the editor before starting the debugger always seem to be
disabled.
<P>
For performance reasons, the debugger pre-loads only the main class of your
project. The main class is either the class with the same name as the
project or the class you specify in the 'Build Menu-Settings-Debug tab-
General Category-Class for debugging/executing'.  If you set breakpoints in
other classes via the editor before the classes are loaded, the breakpoints
are disabled. You can force the pre-loading of secondary classes in two
ways. One method is to list the classes you wish to pre-load in the 'Build
Menu-Settings-Debug tab-Additional classes Category'. The second method is
to right-click a method in the ClassView pane of the Project Workspace
and select Set Breakpoint from the Shortcut menu. This second method
causes a break when program execution enters the method.
<P>
[4.02] I'm not able to view a variable in the Debugger Watch window.
<P>
The following scoping problem is a known bug in the Visual J++ 1.0
debugger. The resolution is to change the second instance of the variable
to a different variable name, or to create the variable at method scope:
<P>
<PRE>   public class Loop
   {
      public static void main(String[] argv)
      {
      // Create n here at method scope to workaround
      // e.g. int n=0;
         for (int n=0; n&lt;10 ; n++)
         {   // First instance of n is viewable in the debugger
            System.out.println(n);
         }
         System.out.println();
         for (int n=0; n&lt;10 ; n++)
         {   // Second instance of n is not viewable in the debugger
            System.out.println(n);
         }
      }
   }

</PRE></OL>[4.03] I can't seem to get debugging to work with Visual J++ and Internet
Explorer 4.0.
<P>
Internet Explorer 4.0 (IE4) can be installed to run in one of two modes:
The mode where IE4 runs integrated with the desktop and in a mode where it
runs like IE3 as a standalone browser. VJ++ needs to "tweak" the
environment of the browser before spawning it for debugging to work. We
can't do this in the IE4 integrated desktop mode. Try uninstalling IE4 and
reinstalling in the standalone mode for VJ to work properly. Please see the
IE4 release notes for more information

<OL><P><LI>ActiveX/COM Integration Questions
</OL> 
<P>
[5.00] Do Visual J++ applets or applications support ActiveX control
containment?
<P>
Currently, the Microsoft Java class libraries do not support the
containment of ActiveX GUI controls. You can't place an ActiveX control
that has a user interface or that sources or sinks events directly onto an
applet without implementing all of the ActiveX control containment and
eventing interfaces yourself. To be clear, you can use ActiveX automation
servers from Java and you can write ActiveX automation servers in Java
utilizing the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine's ability to expose Java
classes as ActiveX objects. You can also have ActiveX controls and Java
applets on the same Web page and have them interact (see the OLEControls
sample in Visual J++).
<P>
[5.01] Why do I get an exception when I try and use an OLE Control (a.k.a.
OCX) in my Java code?
<P>
This can be caused by trying to "new" an OLE Control (OCX) from within your
Java code and then calling one of the methods of the OLE Control. The
Microsoft Java class libraries and Virtual Machines do not currently
support the containment of OLE Controls directly in Java applets. An OLE
Control requires that numerous interfaces and methods be supported in the
"containing" application. This support is currently not implemented.
Therefore, your OLE Control is not fully created and returns an OLE error
when any method is called. This error gets expressed in Java as a thrown
exception. ActiveX automation servers can be used from within your Java
code, and it is possible to write an OLE Control so that it can be created
as a simple automation server that does not require full container support.
More information on this can be found in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
article: <B><A href="../visualc/q146120.htm">Q146120</A></B> - How to Use an OLE Control as an Automation Server.
<P>
[5.02] I am trying to use an ActiveX automation object written in Java (the
COMCallingJava sample) from Visual Basic but I keep getting "Out of Memory"
errors.
<P>
This is normally caused by the Operating System not being able to find the
Java class file that implements the ActiveX automation server. The class
file that implements the Server must be copied to the Java classpath (for
instance: \Windows\Java\Lib) for OLE object creation to work properly for
Java class files. A common example of this is the COMCallingJava sample
application supplied with VJ++. It will work fine when the sample is first
built because the CEuclid.class is in the local directory (which the
Developer Studio adds to the classpath before running Internet Explorer).
Trying to run the VBDriver Visual Basic sample code supplied in the
VBDriver project subdirectory will then fail with the "Out of Memory"
error. This can be remedied by copying CEuclid.class to
the \Windows\Java\Lib directory. You can also set the output directory in
the project build options so that the class file is automatically built in
the appropriate classpath directory.
<P>
[5.03] How can I use a Java class as an ActiveX server-side object with
Microsoft Active Server Pages (ASP)?

<P>
[5.04] My Java COM object that I'm calling from an ASP script is not
getting updated when I compile a new version and copy it to my Server. The
old version gets run unless I reboot the Server, which causes the new
version to load the next time I download the ASP script. Stopping and
restarting the WWW service does not seem to help.
<P>
There is a bug in the Active Server Pages where it is not releasing the
Java COM object after it exits. You can try shutting down the WWW, GOPHER,
and FTP services from the Internet Service Manager, which seems to work for
some people. Just shutting down the WWW service is not enough; you must
shut down all three services. If this doesn't work, try killing the
Inetinfo.exe process, which implements WWW, GOPHER, and FTP. This cannot be
done from the Task Manager; you will need to use pview.exe, which can be
found in the Win32 SDK and Visual C++. Another way to shut down
Inetinfo.exe is to attach the VC++ debugger to the process by right
clicking on Inetinfo.exe in the Task Manager (assuming the VC++ is
installed on the Server machine), and selecting Debug from the Shortcut
menu. You can then use the VC++ debug to exit the process.
<P>
[5.05] I keep getting the Run time error "java.lang.ClassFormatError" on
certain JAVATLB or the Java Type Library Wizard generated classes when
using an ActiveX automation server created with Visual C++.
<P>
This problem occurs when you add automation methods using the VC++
ClassWizard that take parameters of type PTR. The ClassWizard is not adding
[in,out] attributes to the ODL file that it generates. This causes JAVATLB
to generate invalid class files when it is run against the type library for
the MFC automation server. You can work around the problem by manually
modifying the ClassWizard generated ODL file and adding [in, out]
attributes to the automation methods which pass PTR parameters:
<P>
<PRE>   //   NOTE - ClassWizard will maintain method information here.
   //   Use extreme caution when editing this section.
   //{{AFX_ODL_METHOD(PtrTest)
   [id(1)] void pStrTest( [in, out] BSTR* arg1);
   [id(2)] void pLongTest( [in, out] long* arg1);
   //}}AFX_ODL_METHOD

</PRE></OL>[5.06] I'm using the com.ms.com.Variant class in my applet and I am getting
class not found errors. Other classes in the com.ms.com package can't be
found either.
<P>
The com.ms.com package is available only to Java applications and "trusted"
applets. An applet can be made trusted by packaging it in a digitally
signed CAB file. Note that applets run from the Visual J++ Developer Studio
are automatically made trusted in order to facilitate program development
and debugging.
<P>
[5.07] I can't get the ADOJava sample that comes with the OLEDB SDK to
work. It hangs when I click Next.
<P>
When you create the COM class wrapper files for ADO using JavaTLB, use the
/X:m- option to turn off the auto-marshalling of COM parameters.

<OL><P><LI>Microsoft Java VM and SDK Questions
</OL> 
<P>
[6.00] I've heard about the Microsoft SDK for Java. Do I need the SDK in
order to use Visual J++?
<P>
Microsoft has released an SDK for Java that is primarily targeted at Java
tool and library vendors. The Visual J++ package is a standalone product
and does not require the Microsoft SDK for Java or any of the tools
supplied with the SDK. The Microsoft SDK for Java does contain several
tools that are not included in Visual J++, which may be of interest to Java
programmers, such as the tools needed to create the DLL's used by Java
native code method calls. For more information on the Microsoft SDK for
Java, please visit the SDK Web page at <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/java/sdk/">http://www.microsoft.com/java/sdk/.</A></B>
<P>
[6.01] I'm confused about the difference between Visual J++ and the
Microsoft SDK for Java, why both?
<P>
Visual J++ is a full-featured Java development tool. The SDK is a set of
freely available resources for Java developers that will work with any Java
development tool, including VJ++.  The SDK can be obtained from
<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/java/sdk/">http://www.microsoft.com/java/sdk/.</A></B>
<P>
[6.02] I'd like to write Java native code methods in C; can I do that with
Visual J++?
<P>
Visual J++ does not contain all of the tools necessary to create native
code methods. You will need to download the Microsoft SDK for Java to
obtain the tools and documentation for writing Java native code methods in
C or C++ for the Microsoft Java VM. You will also need a C development
tool, such as VC++, which is capable of creating Windows DLLs. For more
information on the Microsoft SDK for Java, please visit the SDK Web page at
<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/java/sdk/">http://www.microsoft.com/java/sdk/.</A></B>
<P>
[6.03] When I try to open my html file in Internet Explorer 3.02 I get
"exception :com.ms.applet.AppletSecurityException : security Couldn't
connect to with origin from file".
<P>
This is caused by one of the security fixes in the Java VM with IE 3.02.
Security has been enhanced such that an applet created via a file URL
(double-clicking on the .html file) cannot open files in directories other
than the one the applet resides in. This can affect the default App Wizard
generated applet since it uses an image subdirectory to contain the image
files for the spinning globe animation. This does not affect applets loaded
via HTTP, or applets run from the Visual J++ Developer Studio.
