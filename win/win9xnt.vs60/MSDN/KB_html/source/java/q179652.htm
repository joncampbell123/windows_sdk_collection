<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>The Need to Sign Java Code</h3>
 
<P>
Java code can typically be grouped into two categories: applications and
applets. Java applications are installed on the user's machine and have
complete access to all system resources. Java applets, however, were
restricted to the "sandbox." This meant that they were restricted from
doing certain tasks, like reading or writing to the hard drive. These
restrictions were necessary to provide a secure environment for applets to
run in but they also severely restricted their functionality.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Early Solutions</h3>
 
<P>
The first attempt to solve this problem was in Microsoft Internet Explorer
3.0. Using a technology called Authenticode (see below for a description),
developers could sign files that contained their Java applets. When the CAB
file was downloaded from a Web page, a certificate dialog box was presented
to the user. If the user trusted the publisher of the code, the Java code
was treated as fully trusted and would have complete access to system
resources. If the user did not trust the publisher of the code, the applets
were denied access. Sun, in its  JDK 1.1 release also had a similar, binary
model. Netscape Navigator 3.0 did not have a comparable security model.
<P>
<P><h3>Current Models</h3>
 
<P>
In the 4.0x releases of Internet Explorer and Netscape Communicator, the
binary model was extended to a more fine-grained access of system
resources. (At the time of release of Internet Explorer 4.0, Sun had not
yet released their JDK 1.2 security model, which also promised fine-grained
access functionality). Internet Explorer 4.0x additionally includes a
feature called the Package Manager that allows developers to install
applets locally and other features such as versioning, namespace
management, and so forth. For end users this resulted in benefits such as
reduced download time since the applet did not have to be downloaded every
time a Web page was hit.
<P>
<P><h3>Differences Between the Microsoft and Netscape Models</h3>
 
<P>
There are five significant differences between the Java security models in
Internet Explorer 4.0x and Netscape Communicator 4.0. These differences and
workarounds, if applicable, are described below.
<P>
Packaging:
<P>
In order to step out of the Java "sandbox," applets need to be packaged in
CAB files for use with Internet Explorer 4.0x and into JAR files for use
with Netscape Communicator. In order to create CAB files, you need to use
the Cabarc or Dubuild utilities. Details about the Cabarc utility is
available in the Microsoft SDK for Java 2.0x
(<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/java/sdk/">http://www.microsoft.com/java/sdk/)</A></B> in the tools section. To create a JAR
file for Netscape Communicator, you need to use the JAR packager utility
from a Web page or the Zigbert utility that can be run from the command
line.
<P>
Installing Java Applets and Applications:
<P>
Java applets and applications may be installed using the Package Manager
that is available as a new feature in Internet Explorer 4.0x. Some of the
advantages of using the Package Manager are versioning control, application
namespace management, improved security, ability to uninstall, and ease of
use. In order to use the Package Manager in Internet Explorer 4.0x, you
need to use the dubuild utility to create a Distribution Unit. There is no
equivalent package management facility in Netscape Communicator 4.0.
Details about the Package Management feature is available in the SDK for
Java 2.0x (<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/java/sdk/)">http://www.microsoft.com/java/sdk/).</A></B>
<P>
Signing Code:
<P>
Signing Java code uses a technology called Authenticode in Internet
Explorer and Object Signing in Communicator. Authenticode technology was
introduced as a feature in Internet Explorer 3.0 and allowed signed CABS to
step out of the sandbox. In Internet Explorer 4.0x this feature was
extended to allow Java code fine-grained access to system resources. Both
CABs and JARs are signed using industry standard X. 509 v3 certificates and
PKCS #7 signatures. Currently, Verisign is the only Certificate Authority
(CA) that issues Microsoft Authenticode and Netscape Object Signing
certificates. However, these certificates are not interchangeable. In
addition, Communicator does not recognize CAB files or the signature that
is embedded in a CAB file. Internet Explorer 4.0x can download jar files
but does not recognize the signature in a JAR file. In order to sign code,
developers should use the Signcode utility. The Signcode utility allows
developers to sign their code with the specific permissions that are being
requested. Details are available at
<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/java/security/secfaq.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/java/security/secfaq.htm.</A></B> The signcode utility is
available in the SDK for Java 2.0x (<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/java/sdk)">http://www.microsoft.com/java/sdk).</A></B>
<P>
Security Model:
<P>
The security model in version 4.0x of Internet Explorer and Communicator
allows Java applets to selectively step out of the sandbox. Both use a
trust model that explicitly requires user permission before the code is
allowed access to system resources. However, there are a few differences
between the two models. The Microsoft model is a static model that requires
the user to trust the code up front. In contrast, the Netscape model is a
dynamic model where the code requests user input during its execution. This
results in the user being presented with multiple dialog boxes at
unpredictable times. The Microsoft model allows parameterization of the
permissions giving developers and users fine-grained access to resources.
For example, in the Microsoft model, a publisher can request access to a
particular file on the users hard drive; this level of detail is not
available in the Netscape model. The Microsoft model is often referred to
in documentation as "Trust Based Security Model for Java" while the
Netscape model is often referred to as "Capabilities Based Model." Details
about the Microsoft model and comparison with other models are available at
<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/java/security/">http://www.microsoft.com/java/security/.</A></B>
<P>
As described above, the Netscape model requires developers to write to a
capabilities API. This results in developers having to maintain two
separate code bases for deploying code for both browsers. One way to avoid
having to maintain separate code bases is to make the security class files
visible on the class path while compiling your Java code. You can then
catch the ClassNotFound exceptions and take appropriate action.
<P>
The Microsoft model does not require developers to write to an API since
the permissions are encoded in the signature. However, an API is provided
for classes that need to assert or deny permissions. For example, if you
are developing a library, you may want to explicitly assert your permission
to access system resources. Details on the assert permission interface are
provided in the documentation for the SDK for Java 2.0x

   TITLE     : PRB: SecurityExceptionEx Exception Running a Java Applet

</PRE>HTML Tags:
<P>
To download a CAB file with Java code, you need to use the applet tag with
the Cabbase parameter. This works with Internet Explorer version 3.0 and
4.0x.
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;APPLET
      code=MyClass.class
      width=100
      height=100&gt;
   &lt;PARAM NAME=cabbase VALUE=MyApplet.cab&gt;
   &lt;PARAM NAME=... VALUE=...&gt;
   &lt;/APPLET&gt;

</PRE>If you wish to use the Package Manager, you need to use the applet tag with
the Useslibrary parameter. The Package Manager feature is available in
Internet Explorer 4.0 and later versions.
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;APPLET
      code=com.mycorp.AppletMain
      width=100
      height=100&gt;
   &lt;PARAM NAME=useslibrary VALUE="MyApplet"&gt;
   &lt;PARAM NAME=useslibrarycodebase VALUE="MyApplet.cab"&gt;
   &lt;PARAM NAME=useslibraryversion VALUE="1,1,2,3"&gt;
   &lt;PARAM NAME=... VALUE=...&gt;
   &lt;/APPLET&gt;

</PRE>If you wish to deploy JAR files with Netscape Communicator 4.0, you need to
use applet tag with the archive parameter:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;APPLET
      code="MyApplet"
      width=200
      height=200&gt;
      archive="test.jar"&gt;
   &lt;PARAM NAME="ApplicationClass" VALUE="mycompany.MyApplet"&gt;
   &lt;PARAM NAME=... VALUE=...&gt;
   &lt;/APPLET&gt;

</PRE>If you wish to fully optimize performance on Internet Explorer 3.x,
Internet Explorer 4.x and Netscape Communicator, you can combine the tags
as in the example below.
<P>
Internet Explorer 4.x looks for the Useslibrary parameter first and will
then look for the Cabbase parameter. Internet Explorer 3.x will not see the
Useslibrary parameter, but will see the Cabbase parameter. The important
feature to note regarding Useslibrary is that it will install the package
on the user's machine permanently until they are removed by the user,
whereas the Cabbase parameterwill simply download and use the CAB every
time the user hits the page. Also note, the Internet Explorer 3.x method
using Cabbase will also work on Internet Explorer 4.x and is sometimes the
best solution. Communicator does not recognize the Cabbase or Useslibrary
parameter and will ignore it. The author of the page will need to decide on
the most appropriate combination of tags/parameters.
<P>
NOTE: If you use the Useslibrary and Cabbase parameters together, both CAB
referenced by these parameters will be searched before individual class
files that may exist on the Web server.  This may cause a performance loss
and should be noted if some Java classes needed by the applet exist only
outside of the cabs on the Web server:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;APPLET
      code="MyApplet"
      width=200
      height=200&gt;
      archive="test.jar"&gt;
   &lt;PARAM name="ApplicationClass" value="mycompany.MyApplet"&gt;
   &lt;PARAM NAME=cabbase VALUE=MyApplet.cab&gt;
   &lt;PARAM NAME=useslibrary VALUE="MyApplet"&gt;
   &lt;PARAM NAME=useslibrarycodebase VALUE="MyApplet.cab"&gt;
   &lt;PARAM NAME=useslibraryversion VALUE="1,1,2,3"&gt;
   &lt;PARAM NAME=... VALUE=...&gt;
   &lt;/APPLET&gt;

</PRE>For more information on how to include an Archive attribute and Cabinets
parameter in the same &lt;applet&gt; tag, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../java/q177159.htm">Q177159</A></B>
   TITLE     : INFO: Support for Multiple CABs or JARs in the Same
                     APPLET Tag

</PRE>NOTE: If you have a complex set of tags, you may want to sniff the user
agent string to determine the client being used. For example since the
package management functionality is not supported in Internet Explorer 3,
you may want to determine the version number of the browser as in the
example below:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;SCRIPT&gt;
      ua=navigator.userAgent;
      v=navigator.appVersion.substring(0,1);
      if (ua.lastIndexOf("MSIE")!=-1)
   {
      if (v == '4')
      {
       'do IE4.x stuff here
      }
      else if (v == '3')
      {
       'do IE3.x stuff here
      }
      else
      {
       'do other browser stuff here
      }
  }
  &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
