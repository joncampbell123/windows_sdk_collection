The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>SDK for Java, version 2.0, 2.01

<LI>Microsoft Win32 Virtual Machine for Java
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When running a Java applet, the security manager throws one of the
following exceptions:
<P>
<PRE>   com.ms.security.SecurityExceptionEx[classname.methodname]

   com.ms.security.SecurityExceptionEx[Host]

   com.ms.security.SecurityExceptionEx[Unknown]

   java.lang.SecurityException: J/Direct method has not been authorized for
   use on behalf of an untrusted caller.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 

<UL><LI>A SecurityExceptionEx[methodname.classname] will occur if your
   applet attempts to perform a trusted operation and is not trusted.

<LI>A SecurityExceptionEx[Host] will occur if the Web browser invoked
   a method that performs a trusted operation and that method did not
   first assert its permission to perform the trusted operation. This
   situation will occur if your applet performs trusted operations in the
   applets default constructor, init(), start(), stop() or destroy()
   method without first asserting its permissions.

<LI>A SecurityExceptionEx[Unknown] will occur if the script engine invoked a
   method that performs a trusted operation, and that method did not first
   assert its permission to perform the trusted operation. This situation
   will occur if your applet has a public method called by VBScript or
   JScript, and that method performs trusted operations without first
   asserting its permissions.

<LI>A "java.lang.SecurityException: J/Direct method has not been authorized
   for use on behalf of an untrusted caller" will occur if the Web browser
   or script engine invoked a method that makes a J/Direct call, and that
   method did not first assert its permission to perform the trusted
   operation.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If a SecurityExceptionEx[methodname.classname] occurs, you must sign your
applet to enable it to perform operations outside of the Java sandbox. For
more information please see the documentation in the Microsoft SDK for Java
2.0 or 2.01. (NOTE: You must sign your cabinet file with the appropriate
permissions. -Low or -LowX permission will guarantee you have appropriate
access or you may sign with the appropriate granular permissions using an
ini file passed to Signcode.exe).
<P>
If a SecurityExceptionEx[Host], SecurityExceptionEx[Unknown], or
"java.lang.SecurityException: J/Direct method has not been authorized for
use on behalf of an untrusted caller" and you are sure your caller cannot
do harm if your trusted operation is performed, you can do one of the
following:

<UL><LI>Assert your permission using the PolicyEngine class. (NOTE: The lifetime
   of PolicyEngine.assertPermission() is the same as the lifetime of the
   method in which it is called. Once the method that asserts its
   permission returns , you would need to re-assert permissions as needed.)

<LI>Spawn a separate thread to perform the trusted operation, giving
   the thread permission to perform the operation.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the Microsoft Virtual Machine (VM) for Java (build 2252 or higher) that
is included in the SDK for Java 2.0/2.01 and Internet Explorer 4.0/4.01,
the security manager now crawls the call stack when an applet is run from a
signed cabinet file. This behavior is new in this build of the VM, and
helps ensure that the applet author is aware of the security risks of
untrusted code manipulating their applet. By asserting an applet's
permission, the programmer is acknowledging that they understand the
security risks and have taken all measures possible to protect the user's
system.
<P>
When trusted operations are performed, the security manager ensures the
object is trusted to perform the operation, and then the call stack is
crawled to ensure all callers are also trusted to make the call. A
SecurityExceptionEx[Host] or SecurityExceptionEx[Unknown] exception will be
thrown if an untrusted caller is found on the call stack.
<P>
The assertPermission(PermissionId pid) method in the PolicyEngine class
will prevent the security manager from crawling the call stack, enabling
your applet to perform trusted operations even when methods on the call
stack are not trusted. You should only assert your permission if you are
sure an untrusted member of the call stack cannot harm the users system. A
logical place to assert your permissions is at the beginning of the method
that is making the trusted call. Once this method returns, subsequent
public methods called from outside the virtual machine will also need to
assert permission before making trusted calls.
<P>
The PermissionID class has predefined granular permissions, such as NETIO,
FILEIO, and so forth. In order to grant full permissions to the applet use
the SYSTEM permission. This is needed for calling J/Direct, COM, and native
methods.
<P>
The following sample applet demonstrates reading a character from a Web
page, which is a trusted operation. This example needs to be trusted either
by placing the file in a signed cabinet file, running the project from
Developer Studio, or by placing the class in the classpath:
<P>
<PRE>   import com.ms.security.*;

   import java.applet.Applet;
   import java.net.*;
   import java.io.*;
   import java.awt.*;

   public class myApplet1 extends Applet {
     TextField message=null;

     public myApplet1() {
       message=new TextField();
       setLayout(new BorderLayout());
       add("Center",message);
     }

     public void init()
    {
       /*
         Our init function needs to read a character from a URL, which is a
         trusted operation.  We assert NET permission to stop the stack
         crawling since the Web page isn't trusted.  The applet must be
         signed so the init() function has permission to perform net
        operations.
       */
       try {
         if (Class.forName("com.ms.security.PolicyEngine") != null) {
           PolicyEngine.assertPermission(PermissionID.NETIO);
         }
       } catch (Throwable cnfe) {
       }

       try {
         URL url = new URL("<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/">http://www.microsoft.com/</A></B>");
         DataInputStream dis;
         dis = new DataInputStream(url.openConnection().getInputStream());
         dis.readChar();
         message.setText("Read character.");
       } catch (MalformedURLException mue) {
         message.setText("MalformedURL");
         mue.printStackTrace();
       } catch (Throwable t) {
         message.setText(t.toString());
         t.printStackTrace();
       }
     }
   }
