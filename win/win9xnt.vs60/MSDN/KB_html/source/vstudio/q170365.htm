</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft releases service packs to provide bug fixes and address other
issues that customers have discovered since the product's release. This

Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 3 is a superset of Visual Studio 97 Service

<P>
As stated above, the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack CD-ROM is available for
purchase over the Web. In addition, the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack will
be available for download from the Web for free. There are several versions
available:

<UL><LI>Visual Basic - All-languages versions: This contains all of the English
   and non-English updates to Visual Basic, including German, Japanese,
   French, Spanish, Italian, Korean, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified
   Chinese. You should select this option if you have any of these versions
   of Visual Basic installed on your machine. Approximate size: 12.3MB.

<LI>CORE: This CORE set of updates includes all of the English and
   non-English updates for Visual Basic, Visual InterDev, Visual J++,
   Visual FoxPro, and Visual SourceSafe. You should select this option if
   you have any of the previously listed products. Approximate size:
   37.8MB.

<LI>FULL: This FULL set of updates includes everything in CORE, plus all of
   the updates for English and non-English versions of Visual C++. For
   Visual C++ users who previously installed Service Pack 1 FULL (or
   installed the updates from the CD-ROM), please see the Special Note
   above. Approximate size: 91.4MB.
<P>
</UL>Due to the scope of updates available on the Visual Studio 97 Service
Pack and the subsequent large size of the files, we recommend ordering the
CD-ROM version. However, we want to make the files available for download
for those who prefer it.
<P>
You can get to the web download from the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack
Web site:
<P>

</PRE><h3>Uninstalling the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack</h3>
 
<P>
You must uninstall the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack manually; it is not
built into the product. To uninstall Visual Studio 97 Service Pack updates
to the developer tools on your system, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Uninstall the developer tools (Visual C++, Visual Basic, etc.).

<P><LI>Delete any remaining Microsoft developer tools product files (but not
   files or programs you have created).

<P><LI>Reinstall the developer tools.
<P>
</OL><h3>Detecting Visual Studio 97 Service Pack Updates</h3>
 
<P>
The Help About box for developer tools does not indicate what updates have
been made since the initial release of the product in 1997.
<P>
After a service pack has been applied to a developer tool, the only
indication that the service pack has been applied is in the version
information embedded in file properties for the binary files that were
updated.
