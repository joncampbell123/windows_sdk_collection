4.10 4.10a
WINDOWS
<P>
<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Project for Windows 95, versions 4.1 4.1a
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0, 7.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Microsoft Project, the following error message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not initialize Visual Basic for Applications.
   Timer Driver not installed.

</PRE>The same message also appears when you attempt to insert a module in a
Microsoft Excel workbook.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are several possible causes:
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1</h3>
 
<P>
A conflict with another device or software running on the system.
<P>
To test whether there is a conflict with a device or software application
running on the system, start Windows 95 in Safe Mode. If Microsoft Project
starts properly, then check for and disable items loading in the Windows 95
Start folder and also check for items in the registry Run, RunOnce,
RunServices, and RunServicesOnce keys. You can find these keys at:
<P>
<PRE>   \\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion

</PRE>To remark-out a key's value data without deleting it, edit the value and
place a semi-colon or other character as the first character in the value
name. This will disable the device so that you can test without it being
loaded when Windows 95 starts.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Case 2</h3>
 
<P>
The Vba32.dll, Vbaen32.dll, or Vbaen32.olb file is corrupted or missing.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 3</h3>
 
<P>
The file Mmsystem.dll is corrupted or missing. This file should be in the
Windows\System folder. The correct file size is 103,248 bytes, and the
correct file date is July 11, 1995.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 4</h3>
 
<P>
The System.ini file is missing a line that says "drivers=Mmsystem.dll," or
the file Mmsystem.dll is missing from the Windows\System folder.
<P>
NOTE: The "drivers=" line in the System.ini file may contain more than one
file name to the right of the equal sign.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use the appropriate method for your situation.
<P>
<PRE>Method 1:   Remove the offending program that is conflicting with the
            Windows 95 virtual timer services.

Method 2:   If the files Vba32.dll, Vbaen32.dll, or Vbaen32.olb are
            corrupted or missing, rename the files and reinstall
            Microsoft Project.

            1. In the Windows\System folder, locate the following files:

               Vba32.dll
               Vbaen32.dll
               Vbaen32.olb

            2. Select each file and give it a different name. For example,
               you might change the extension to "old."

            3. Reinstall Microsoft Project.

Method 3:   If the Mmsystem.dll file is corrupted or is missing, replace
            the existing Mmsystem.dll with the extracted file from the
            setup disks.

            The file is located in WIN95_08.CAB on Disk 8 of the Windows 95
            disks, or in the Win95 folder of the Windows 95 CD-ROM.

            For additional information on how to extract individual files
            from CAB files, please see the following article in the
            Microsoft Knowledge Base:

               ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../zmiscellaneous/q129605.htm">Q129605</A></B>
               TITLE     : How to Extract Original Compressed Windows 
                           Files 

Method 4:   If the Mmsystem.dll file is missing from the System.ini file,
            edit the System.ini file so that Mmsystem.dll is listed on the
            "drivers=" line, and make sure that Mmsystem.dll is present in
            the Windows\System folder.
