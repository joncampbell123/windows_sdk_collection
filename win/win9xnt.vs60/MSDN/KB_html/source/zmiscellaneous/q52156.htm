<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Zapping the Parameter RAM (PRAM) of a Macintosh is one technique for
solving various system and application problems on a Macintosh. It is
performed at restart time and involves a simple keystroke-combination. Once
it is done, many of your settings for Control Panel devices will be reset
to their default values.
<P>
The parameters (PRAM) of a Macintosh keep track of various settings in the
Control Panel, such as General, Mouse and Keyboard. "Zapping," or
resetting, the PRAM returns the above files to their default settings.
<P>
Zapping the parameters of a Macintosh should only be used as a last resort
solution for unusual System behavior. Always first try reinstalling the
System and programs or booting up with a floppy System disk and rebuilding
the desktop.
<P>
<P><h2>ZAPPING THE PRAM</h2>
 
<P>
To zap the parameters of a Macintosh, do the following:
<P>
System 7.0 and later:
<P>
<PRE>   1. From the Special menu, choose Restart

   2. After you release the mouse button, hold down the following keys on
      the keyboard:  COMMAND+OPTION+P+R and continue to hold them down
      until your hear the second startup sound.

      If you don't hear a startup sound, then wait until your screen
      displays black for the second time, and then release the keys.

</PRE>System 6.0 and earlier:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Hold down the COMMAND+OPTION+SHIFT keys as you choose Control Panels
      from the Apple Menu

</PRE>For more information about zapping the PRAM, see the "Items to be Reset
after Zapping PRAM" section below.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The PRAM on a Macintosh is a small, battery powered, piece of RAM. It is
powered by an internal battery so that the settings that are stored in PRAM
are preserved even when your machine is turned off. These settings are
stored in PRAM, instead in a file on disk, so that when you boot off of a
different System disk, the settings remain the same. Most of the settings
that are stored in PRAM are those that you have selected using Control
Panel devices in your System:Control Panels folder (such as whether you are
using color or grays, an option set by using the Monitors Control Panel
device). When you turn on your Macintosh, the settings that are stored in
the PRAM are then read into the main RAM on your Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h3>Items to be Reset after Zapping PRAM</h3>
 
<P>
After Zapping your PRAM, you may need to reset some of the Control Panel
device settings on your machine. The following is a list of some of the
more important Control Panel device settings that should be changed after
zapping your PRAM. The actual changes to your PRAM settings will vary
somewhat, depending on the version of the System software that you are
using, and on your computer model.

<PRE>                    to Black/White)
