<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
After you install Microsoft Office version 4.2, you may not be able to
access Cue Cards in PowerPoint version 4.0a. You may receive the message:
<P>
<PRE>   PowerPoint could not locate or start the Cue Cards. It can be
   installed using PowerPoint setup.

</PRE>Microsoft Office 4.2 contains a version of the POWERPNT.DLL file that is
not compatible with Cue Cards. To correct this problem, Microsoft has
produced an Application Note titled "Correction to the POWERPNT.DLL File
Included with Office 4.2" (WT1017), which contains an updated version of
the POWERPNT.DLL file.

</PRE><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Office version 4.2 includes PowerPoint version 4.0a. A
mistake was made when the PowerPoint files were added to Office, and
the wrong version of the POWERPNT.DLL file was included. As a result,
you will not be able to access Cue Cards in PowerPoint.
<P>
To resolve this problem, replace your current POWERPNT.DLL file with
the correct version of POWERPNT.DLL, which is on the WT1017 disk
included with this Application Note.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To replace your POWERPNT.DLL file, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Exit PowerPoint if you have it running.

<P><LI>Insert the enclosed WT1017 disk in the appropriate floppy disk
   drive.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;:\pptdll.exe &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the WT1017 disk
   and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory where your
   POWERPNT.DLL file currently resides. For example, if POWERPNT.DLL
   is located in the POWERPNT directory on drive C and the WT1017 disk
   is in drive A, type the following command and press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\pptdll.exe c:\powerpnt
</PRE>
<P><LI>The file PPTDLL.EXE is a self-extracting file that allows a large
   file, which normally would not fit on a floppy disk, to be
   distributed in this manner. To extract the POWERPNT.DLL file from
   the PPTDLL.EXE self-extracting file, do the following:
<P>
   a. Change to your PowerPoint directory. For example, if your
<P><PRE>      PowerPoint directory is on drive C and is named POWERPNT, type
      the following lines at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER
      after each line:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         c:
         cd \powerpnt

   b. Type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER.

         pptdll.exe

   c. If you are asked if you want to overwrite the existing
      POWERPNT.DLL file, choose Yes.

</PRE></OL>You can now access PowerPoint's Cue Cards.
