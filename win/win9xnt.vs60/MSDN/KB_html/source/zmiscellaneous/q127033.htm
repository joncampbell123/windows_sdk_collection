<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you are troubleshooting problems on a Macintosh, you may want to do a
clean installation of the System software.
<P>
Doing a clean installation of the system software creates a "clean" copy of 
your System Folder. Creating a clean copy means that you do not have to
move or hide the various files in your System Folder. If you are running
System Software 7.5 and above, you can use System Installer program to
create a new System Folder. (Your old System Folder will be saved as
"Previous System Folder.")
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>How to Do a Clean Installation of System Software</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>System Software 7.5.x and 7.6</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start your computer from the existing System folder on the hard drive.

<P><LI>Insert either the Install Disk 1 or the System CD, and
   double-click the Installer program.

<P><LI>In the Welcome screen, click Continue.

<P><LI>If you are installing System 7.5 or System 7.5.2, press COMMAND+SHIFT+K
   in the System Installation dialog box. Click "Install New System
   Folder", then click OK.
<P>
   If you are installing System 7.6, click Options in the Install System
   Software dialog box. Click "Install New System Folder", then click OK.

<P><LI>In the next dialog box, click Install New System Folder, then click
   OK.
<P>
   You should now be back in the System Software Installation dialog box.

<P><LI>Click the drop-down arrow next to Easy Install, and select Custom
   Install.

<P><LI>From the Features To Be Installed list, select System Software.
<P>
   To speed up the troubleshooting process, you will probably want to do a
   minimal installation of the System software, which will install the
   minimum number of files necessary to start your Macintosh.

<P><LI>Click the small triangle next to System Software and clear (remove
   the Xs from) all the check boxes EXCEPT for the Minimal System For The
   Macintosh Only check box.
<P>
   NOTE: If you are working with a Power Macintosh with 16 MB of RAM or
   less, you may also want to install Memory (under Control Panels).
<P>
   NOTE: If you have a CD-ROM, you should also click the triangle next
   to Multimedia Software and select the CD-ROM item to install the
   extension for accessing your CD-ROM drive.

<P><LI>Click Clean Install.
<P>
   The installation program then proceeds, starting with "Install Disk 1"
   and continues with "Install Disk 2" and "Install Disk 4," and then
   finally "Install Disk 1" again.
<P>
   When you get a screen that talks about Power Talk and QuickDraw
   GX, click the Continue button.
<P>
</OL>If everything went successfully, you will be asked to Restart your
computer.
<P>
Your original System Folder will be renamed "Previous System Folder." Do
NOT delete it just yet. Your new System Folder will contain the following
items:
<P>
<PRE>   Apple Menu Items folder
   Control Panels folder
   Extensions folder
   Finder file
   Fonts folder
   Preferences folder
   Startup Items folder
   System suitcase

</PRE></OL>The Apple Menu Items folder will contain just one item, an alias to Control 
Panels folder. The Preferences folder will also contain just one item, the 
Finder Preferences file (if you select the Multimedia option, then your 
Extensions folder will contain the Apple CD-ROM extension). All other new 
folders in the new System folder will be empty.
<P>
<P><h3>System Software 8.0</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start your computer from the existing System folder on the hard drive.

<P><LI>Insert either the Install Disk 1 or the System CD, and
    double-click the Installer program.

<P><LI>In the Welcome screen, click Continue.
 
<P><LI>Select the  "Perform Clean Installation" check box in the Select 
    Destination dialog box, then click Select.

<P><LI>In the Important Information dialog box, click Continue.

<P><LI>In the Software License Agreement dialog box, click Continue. Click 
    Agree in the dialog box that appears.
<P>
</OL>To speed up the troubleshooting process, you will probably want to do a
minimal installation of the System software, which will install the
minimum number of files necessary to start your Macintosh. Steps 7 through 
12 outline how to perform a minimal install of the System software.

<OL><P><LI>Click Customize in the Install Software dialog box.

<P><LI>In the "Custom Installation and Removal" dialog box, clear all of the    
    check boxes except for the "Mac OS 8" check box, then click Start.

<P><LI>Click Continue in the "Welcome to MacOS 8" dialog box.

<P><LI>Click the drop-down arrow next to Easy Install, and select Custom
    Install.

<P><LI>Click "System Software for this computer".
<P>
   NOTE: If you are working with a Power Macintosh with 16 MB of RAM or
   less, you may also want to install Memory (under Control Panels).
<P>
   NOTE: If you have a CD-ROM, you should also click the triangle next
   to Multimedia Software and select the CD-ROM item to install the
   extension for accessing your CD-ROM drive.

<P><LI>Click Clean Install.
<P>
</OL>The installation of the System Software proceeds to run. If everything 
installs successfully, you will be asked to Restart your computer.
<P>
Your original System Folder will be renamed "Previous System Folder." Do
NOT delete it just yet. Your new System Folder will contain the following
items:
<P>
<PRE>   Apple Menu Items folder
   Application Support folder
   Control Panels folder
   Control Strip Modules folder
   Extensions folder
   Finder file
   Fonts folder
   Launcher Items folder
   MacTCP DNR file
   Preferences folder
   Scrapbook File file
   Scripting Additions folder
   Shutdown Items folder
   Startup Items folder
   System suitcase
   Text Encodings folder

</PRE></OL><h3>Steps to Reverse the Above Process</h3>
 
<P>
If you successfully installed a clean System folder by following the
steps 1-9 above, but need to go back to the original System folder, do
the following:

<OL><P><LI>Restart your computer from either your Disk Tools disk or your System
   CD.
<P>
   NOTE: If you have difficulty forcing your machine to start from the
   CD-ROM drive, refer to the articles listed below for instructions on
   how to control boot drives.
<P>
   For additional information about booting from CD-ROM, please see the
   following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../zmiscellaneous/q120099.htm">Q120099</A></B>

      TITLE     : Booting Macintosh Centris and Performa Machines

   The drive from which the computer starts will have its icon displayed 
   on top of all other drive icons on the desktop.

</PRE><P><LI>Move the new System Folder on the Hard Drive into the trash, and
   empty the trash.

<P><LI>Change the name of the folder called "Previous System Folder" to
   "System Folder" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Open the newly renamed System Folder, and then close it.
<P>
   This step allows your computer to recognize this new System Folder.

<P><LI>Restart your computer.
<P>
   You should now be starting from your original System Folder on your 
   hard disk drive.
<P>
   NOTE: If your computer cannot find a System Folder on the hard drive
   after you restart the computer (a disk icon appears showing with a
   question mark), you probably did not open and close the System folder,
   as outlined in Step 4. You will have to insert either the Disk Tools
   disk or your System CD and then repeat steps 4 and 5.
