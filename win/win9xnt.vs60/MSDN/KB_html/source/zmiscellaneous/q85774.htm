<P><h2>WHAT IS THE MSDL?</h2>
 
<P>
The MSDL operates like any MS-DOS-based computer bulletin board system
(BBS). The MSDL contains Application Notes from Microsoft Product
Support Services (PSS), as well as driver files and other types of
support files for download. To use the MSDL, you must have a computer
with a modem and a terminal package. Any terminal package, such as
Microsoft Works, Windows Terminal, Procomm, or Crosstalk(TM), will
work with the MSDL. If you experience difficulty while you are working
with the MSDL, try calling a local BBS so you can avoid paying long-
distance charges while you try to determine the cause of the problem.
<P>
Please note that technical support is not available for the MSDL.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Connect to the MSDL</h3>
 
<P>
The MSDL supports 1200, 2400, 9600, and 14,400 baud rates (V.32 and
V.42), with 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and no parity. Make sure the
terminal software is configured to operate with these settings. After
you have chosen these settings, you can begin the session as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Call the MSDL at (425) 936-6735.

<P><LI>Enter your full name and the location you are calling from.
<P>
   The MSDL will list some basic instructions and information and then
   display the Main menu:

</PRE></OL><h3>How to Download Files</h3>
 
<P>
If you already know the exact name of the file to download, follow the
steps below. If you do not know the filename, see the following
section "How to Search for Files."

<OL><P><LI>At the Main menu, press 1 for Download File.

<P><LI>Press D and then press the ENTER key.

<P><LI>When asked for the filename, type the name of the file you want to
   download. Be sure to include the correct extension (usually .exe);
   also, be sure to differentiate between the letter "O" and the
   number 0 (zero) in filenames.
<P>
   Hint: If you see a "-More-" prompt at the bottom of the screen,
   you can press the SPACEBAR to see more files.

<P><LI>When asked which protocol you would like to use, enter any protocol
   supported by your terminal package (check your software manual for
   more information). If you are unsure, press X for Xmodem.

<P><LI>The MSDL will then display the "Please start the download in your
   communications program" message. When you see this message, start
   the download process with your terminal software. For example, if
   you are using Windows Terminal, choose Receive Binary File from the
   Transfers menu.
<P>
   If you don't start the process, the transfer will fail, and you'll
   need to start again at step 2.

<P><LI>After your transfer is complete, you can quit the MSDL by pressing
   E to choose Exit.
<P>
</OL><h3>How to Search for Files</h3>
 
<P>
If you do not know the exact name of the file to download, or if you
simply want to find out what files are available, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>At the Main menu, press 2 for File Index.

<P><LI>Press F for File Search.

<P><LI>You will be prompted to enter the text to search on. For example,
   if you want to search for a Hewlett-Packard(R) (HP(R)) LaserJet(R)
   printer driver, type "hp laserjet" (without the quotation marks)
   and press the ENTER key.
<P>
   The matching filenames will be displayed in a list.
<P>
   Hint: If you see a "-More-" prompt at the bottom of the screen,
   you can press the SPACEBAR to see more files.
<P>
   If you don't find what you are looking for, see the following
   section, "How to Use the File Index," for instructions.

<P><LI>After you see the file that you want, write down the filename so
   you can download the file later.

<P><LI>Press the ENTER key to quit the search option.
<P>
</OL>For instructions about how to download the file, see the preceding
section, "How to Download Files."
<P>
<P><h3>How to Use the File Index</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>At the Main menu, press 2 for File Index.

<P><LI>In the next screen (the File menu), choose the number that matches
   the application you are looking for.

<P><LI>Continue to select the appropriate number from the menus that
   appear until you see a list of files displayed on the screen.
<P>

   you can press the SPACEBAR to see more files.

<P><LI>After you locate the file, write down the name. Press the SPACEBAR
   until you see the following at the bottom of the screen:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;D&gt;ownload, &lt;P&gt;rotocol, &lt;E&gt;xamine, &lt;N&gt;ew, &lt;L&gt;ist, or &lt;H&gt;elp
      Selection or &lt;CR&gt; to exit:
</PRE>
<P><LI>To download the file, press D, then follow steps 3-6 in "How to
   Download Files" on page 2.
<P>
</OL><h3>How to Use the File After It Is Downloaded</h3>
 
<P>
You now have your file. If the file has an .exe extension, run the
file by typing its name at the MS-DOS command prompt. The .exe file
will extract its contents and the resulting files are then ready to be
installed. Please refer to any text files that have been extracted for
exact instructions about using the downloaded file or files.
<P>
<P><h2>CUSTOMER TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE FOR THE MSDL</h2>
 
<P>
You may encounter one or more of the following problems when using the
MSDL:

<UL><LI>Your connection fails.

<LI>Your connection succeeds but results in garbage characters on the
   screen.

<LI>The MSDL line constantly rings but does not answer.

<LI>Your attempt to download a file results in the message "Please
   start the download in your communications program."

<LI>Your attempt to download a file fails.
<P>
</UL>Procedures for correcting these problems follow, but please remember that
if for some reason you cannot correct them, you can always receive MSDL
files by downloading them, or by calling Microsoft Product Support Services
at (425) 454-2030 (or your direct support number) or the Microsoft Sales
Information Center (MSIC) at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
<P><h3>Your Connection Fails</h3>
 
<P>
If you cannot connect to the MSDL, or if you have connected but
nothing happens, try the following steps in order:

<OL><P><LI>Check your communications protocol software and make sure data bits
   is set to 8, parity to none, and stop bits to 1--(8,N,1).

<P><LI>Select a lower baud rate. Doing this will result in slower data
   transfers, but it may allow you to get the files you need. If you
   still cannot connect or must use a higher baud rate, try step 3.

<P><LI>Disable modem data compression, specifically V.32bis and V.42bis,
   and try connecting again. There are different types of data
   compression, so make sure you disable all types on your modem.
<P>
   Data compression is intended to allow higher data transfer rates,
   but most MSDL files are already compressed. In fact, the transfer
   rate can be slower if your modem instructs the MSDL-side modem to
   compress files that are already compressed before sending them.
<P>
   To disable data compression, you must modify your terminal software
   Originate string. For example, most Courier modems require the
   addition of "&amp;K0" to the Originate string. In Windows Terminal,
   choose Modem Commands from the Settings menu, and modify the
   Originate string ATQ0V1E1S0=0 to read ATQ0V1E1S0=0&amp;K0. Data
   compression will be disabled the next time the modem is dialed.
<P>
   If you do not have a Courier modem, or if you are unable to
   determine exactly how to disable compression for your modem, see
   your modem manufacturer's documentation for instructions.
   If you disable all compression and still cannot connect to the
   MSDL, proceed to step 4.

<P><LI>Disable error correction. There are different types of error
   correction, so make sure you disable all levels. To disable error
   correction for Courier modems, add "&amp;M0" to the terminal software
   Originate string. If you do not have a Courier modem, see your
   modem manufacturer's documentation for instructions.

<P><LI>If none of these steps corrects the problem, try a different modem.
<P>
</OL>If the connection still fails, obtain the files by one of the other
means available to you. If you need further assistance, call Microsoft
Product Support Services at (425) 454-2030 (or use your direct support
number).
<P>
Your Connection Succeeds but Results
in Garbage Characters on the Screen
 

<OL><P><LI>Make sure the number you are dialing is (425) 936-6735.

<P><LI>Make sure that data bits are set to 8, parity to none, and stop
   bits to 1 (8,N,1) in your communications program.

<P><LI>Use the troubleshooting tips under the section titled "Your
   Connection Fails."
<P>
</OL><h3>The MSDL Line Constantly Rings but Does Not Answer</h3>
 
<P>
If calling the MSDL results in constant ringing, try calling again
later in the day. This problem is caused by the failure of one or more
modems to reset correctly after a user has hung up. Generally this
problem occurs when the MSDL is extremely busy. This situation is
usually corrected soon after it is detected.
<P>
Your Attempt to Download a File Results in the Message
<P><h3>"Please Start the Download in Your Communications Program"</h3>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, you must start the Receive File process in
your communications software. For example, in Windows Terminal, choose
Receive Binary File from the Transfers menu. The MSDL cannot send data
until it receives this signal.
<P>
This information is also listed in the MSDL Main Menu under Help.
<P>
<P><h3>Your Attempt to Download a File Fails</h3>
 
<P>
If your download attempt fails, try these procedures:

<OL><P><LI>Make sure you have selected the same protocol in your
   communications software and from the MSDL.

<P><LI>Switch to a different protocol.

<P><LI>Disable data compression on your modem. (See step 3 in the "Your
   Connection Fails" section.)

<P><LI>Try a lower baud rate or connect to the MSDL again. This often
   corrects problems caused by bad phone connections or noisy phone
   lines.
<P>
</OL>If the download still fails, obtain the files by one of the other
means available to you. If you need further assistance, call Microsoft
Product Support Services at (425) 454-2030 (or use your direct support
number).
