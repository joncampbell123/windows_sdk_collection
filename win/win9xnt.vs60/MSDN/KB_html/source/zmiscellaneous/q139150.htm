The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you run Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95 on a multi-user Windows
NT computer, you may not be able to use the following features:

<UL><LI>The graphic import filters
<LI>The text converters
<LI>The AutoCorrect feature
<LI>The spelling checker
<P>
</UL>This problem is related to access permissions to the Windows NT registry.
<P>
NOTE: If the problem only occurs in Clipart Gallery, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../zmiscellaneous/q26885.htm">Q26885</A></B>
   TITLE     : PT95: Clipart Gallery 2.0a Update for Windows NT Users

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Under a Typical installation of Windows NT workstation, users have limited
rights to the Windows NT registry. Only administrators and owners (those
who install particular programs) have full access to the registry.
<P>
This problem occurs with PowerPoint 7.0 because Powerpnt.exe in version
7.0 sends a request to the Windows NT registry for full access (note that
PowerPoint 7.0b does not make this request). Users rights are restricted
on multi-user workstations and the request for full access is denied. If
you are logged on as a user with limited rights, this request may be
denied under PowerPoint 7.0. Because the request is denied, the features
mentioned at the beginning of this article may not work as expected.
<P>
This problem occurs in PowerPoint 7.0 under the following circumstances:

<UL><LI>The installation was performed by an administrator (who is then the
   owner)

<LI>A single user installs PowerPoint (and then becomes the owner) and
   other users attempt to use PowerPoint features.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To gain access to these features, use any of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Update the PowerPoint installation to version 7.0b</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Make the User an Administrator</h3>
 
<P>
Add each user account that will be using PowerPoint to the Administrators
group.
<P>
NOTE: This is not the best alternative as it gives potentially unskilled
users the ability to alter user rights, change permissions, and delete
essential operating system files.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 3: Grant Full Permission to Registry Keys</h3>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
If you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair
Disk (ERD).
<P>
Edit the Windows NT Registry and grant selected users full permission to
the necessary keys.

<OL><P><LI>Log on as an administrator and run REGEDT32.EXE

<P><LI>Go to each location below:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools
<PRE></PRE>         \AutoCorrect
         \Graphics Filters
         \Proofing Tools
         \Text Converters

</PRE><P><LI>Click Security. Click Permissions.

<P><LI>Click Add , click Show Users, and add the appropriate users.

<P><LI>Assign each user Full Permission to the keys involved.

<P><LI>Click OK and indicate that you are changing permission on the
   subkeys.

<P><LI>Click OK again and confirm that you want to replace Permissions (this
   will not necessarily fix the problem with PowerPoint Help.)
<P>
   NOTE: As an alternative, you may create a new group with full
   access to these keys and add each user to the new group. If you
   later install PowerPoint 7.0b, you can delete this group or
   remove the users from it (the group is no longer necessary).
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 4: If the Problem Occurs on a Non-Multi-User Workstation</h3>
 
<P>
If you are experiencing this problem on a Windows NT Workstation that is
not a multi-user workstation, the problem stems from having
installed PowerPoint as an Administrator and attempting to use its
features as a user with lesser rights. In this case, run PowerPoint
Setup and log in as the user rather than as the administrator. This
will ensure that the user is registered to use all the features.
This will have minimal or no effect on system-level administrative
issues.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article.
