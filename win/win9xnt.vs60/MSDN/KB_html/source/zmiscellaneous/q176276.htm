This article lists frequently asked questions about mail migration on MSN,
The Microsoft Network.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Q: What is mail migration?
<P>
   A: Mail migration is the process of configuring your MSN e-mail
<P><PRE>      account to use an Internet based e-mail client that uses Post
      Office Protocol (POP3) and Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP)
      e-mail servers. These e-mail servers are faster and more reliable,
      and support Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) encoded
      file attachments, so it is easier to send and receive documents
      over the Internet.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Q: How do I know if my MSN e-mail account has already been migrated?
<P>
   A: To verify that your MSN e-mail account has already been migrated,
<P><PRE>      use the following steps:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click People.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      2. In the Look In box, click MSN.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      3. In the Name box, type your first and last name, and then click
<PRE></PRE>         Find Now.

      4. If the MSN Sign-In screen appears, click Connect.

      If your e-mail address is listed as &lt;Member_ID&gt;@email.msn.com,
      your MSN e-mail account has already been migrated.

</PRE><P><LI>Q: Why did my e-mail address change to &lt;Member_ID&gt;@email.msn.com?
<P>
   A: After mail migration, your e-mail address has not changed. You may
<P><PRE>      continue to use &lt;Member_ID&gt;@msn.com as your e-mail address. However,
      when you use &lt;Member_ID&gt;@email.msn.com as your e-mail address, your
      e-mail messages travel more quickly over the Internet and are often
      received in less time.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Q: How can I migrate my MSN e-mail account?
<P>
   A: You can use any of the following methods to migrate your MSN e-mail
<P><PRE>      account:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Method 1
      --------
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      The first time you connect to MSN after you install MSN 2.5, you
      are prompted to use Microsoft Internet Mail. Click the Use Internet
      Mail link to migrate your MSN e-mail account.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Method 2
      --------
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      On the Communicate Home Page, click Frequently Asked Questions,
      and then click Using E-mail. Follow the instructions on the screen
      to migrate your MSN e-mail account.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Method 3
      --------
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Navigate to the following Web page on MSN
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         <B><A href="http://setup.msn.com/membersonly/config/default.asp">http://setup.msn.com/membersonly/config/default.asp</A></B>

      and then click the Use Internet Mail link to migrate your MSN
      e-mail account.

      Method 4
      --------

      If you are temporarily unable to connect to MSN, use the following
      steps to migrate your MSN e-mail account:

      1. Insert the MSN CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive. If the Auto Insert
         Notification option is turned on, close the Welcome To MSN window
         that opens on the desktop.

      2. Double-click My Computer.

      3. Right-click the MSN (CD-ROM drive) icon, and then click Explore.

      4. Double-click the Msnsetup folder.

      5. Double-click the Compnts folder.

      6. Double-click the Coreui.exe file. Follow the instructions on the
         screen, and accept all default settings.

      7. Close all open windows, and then restart the computer.

</PRE><P><LI>Q: I've installed MSN 2.5, and signed up for a new MSN account. Do I
<P><PRE>      still need to migrate my MSN e-mail account?
</PRE><P>
   A: No, because all new MSN members automatically have their MSN e-mail
<P><PRE>      accounts configured to use Internet Mail.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Q: I've downloaded Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0, and am unable to
<P><PRE>      send or receive e-mail using Microsoft Outlook Express. How can I
      send and receive e-mail using Outlook Express?
</PRE><P>
   A: To send and receive e-mail using Outlook Express you must have
<P><PRE>      the newest version of MSN, version 2.5.
</PRE><P>
   For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE ID: <B><A href="../zmiscellaneous/q174810.htm">Q174810</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Can I Use Outlook Express Without Upgrading to MSN 2.5?

</PRE><P><LI>Q: Can I use Outlook Express or Internet Mail with MSN 2.0?
<P>
   A: Outlook Express and Internet Mail can only be used with MSN 2.5.

<P><LI>Q: Why can't I switch back to Microsoft Exchange (Inbox) or Microsoft
<P><PRE>      Outlook after migrating to Internet Mail?
</PRE><P>
   A: After you migrate to Internet Mail, your MSN e-mail account is
<P><PRE>      moved to the new POP3 e-mail servers. Past e-mail configurations
      using Microsoft Exchange (Inbox) or Outlook attempt to access your
      MSN e-mail account on the old MAPI servers. Since your MSN e-mail
      account no longer exists on the MAPI servers, you are unable to
      send or receive e-mail.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: To use Outlook after mail migration, you must install the
      Internet Mail Enhancement Patch.
