The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Apple Macintosh System Software, version 7.5.3
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists the enhancements that are included as part of the System
7.5 Update 2.0.
<P>
This list was taken from the "New in this Update - 2" file that came with
the installation disk or disc:
<P>
Note: The System 7.5 Update 2.0 includes all of the changes that were with
the System 7.5 Update 1.0. These changes are listed separately in the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE ID: 138646
   TITLE:      Changes with Macintosh System 7.5 Update 1.0

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Changes to SimpleText</h3>
 
<P>
Includes SimpleText version 1.3.1, which supports QuickDraw
3D.
<P>
Changes to the Starter
 
<P>
This Update includes Starter version 2.8 which incorporates
minor behind the scenes changes not likely to be visible to
users.
<P>
<P><h3>Other New or Changed Components</h3>
 
<P>
Includes Open Transport v.1.1, a major re-implementation of
the network system software for use on all 68030-, 68040-, and
PowerPC-based computers except the desktop 5200, 5300, 6200,
and 6300 series computers. After an Easy Install, Open
Transport will be active only if it was active before the
update was installed (it cannot be active on desktop 5200,
5300, 6200, and 6300 series computers). For more information,
see the Open Transport Information folder, inside the Apple
Extras folder.
<P>
Includes a small application called Network Software Selector
(NSS), which enables users of 68030-, 68040-, and early
PowerPC-based computers to choose between Open Transport and
classic AppleTalk if both are installed. (You must restart
the computer for the change to take effect.) PCI-based
computers support only Open Transport.
<P>
NSS is in the Apple Extras folder; information on using it is
built into the application. NSS is intended to ease the
transition to Open Transport by allowing you to use the older
networking software if there is a compatibility problem with
an application and Open Transport. Once the problem is
resolved, you should switch back to Open Transport.
<P>
<PRE>     Note: Because MacTCP is incompatible with Open
           Transport v.1.1, MacTCP is disabled any
           time Open Transport is selected using the
           Network Software Selector. (Open Transport
           uses the TCP/IP control panel instead of
           MacTCP.) If, however, you reselect classic
           AppleTalk, MacTCP is enabled again.

</PRE>Includes SerialDMA 2.0.2 for use on all PowerPC-based
computers, the Centris 660AV, Quadra 660AV, Quadra 840AV, as
well as the corresponding Performa and Apple Workgroup Server
products. SerialDMA provides a complete rewrite of the DMA
serial driver which originally accompanied these computers,
thus fixing the occasional system hang, communications
timeouts, poor communications performance, and other glitches.
The new SerialDMA 2.0.2 driver not only corrects these
problems, but also exceeds the performance and reliability
standards for serial communications on the Mac OS platform
(providing support for speeds of up to 230,400 baud).
<P>
SerialDMA 2.0.2 is native on the PowerPC-based computers.
<P>
Includes a new version of Apple Modem Tool (1.5.5), which
supports 115.2K and 230.4K connections on SerialDMA 2.0
machines.
<P>
Includes the latest version of PC Setup (v1.0.7) for use with
all DOS Compatible Mac OS computers.
<P>
Includes Screen control panel version 1.0.7. This new version
does not crash if it's in the System Folder of a Macintosh SE
during startup or when it's opened on any 68000-based Mac OS-
based computer.
<P>
Includes File Sharing 7.6.2, which includes several
improvements over previous versions. Now, when file sharing is
turned on, removable disks and CD-ROM discs will automatically
be shared (except for audio CDs, which will no longer be
shared). To eject a removable disk or CD-ROM disc, you no
longer have to turn off File Sharing, as long as no other user
is currently connected to the shared volume.
<P>
Includes a faster version of the AppleShare Workstation client
software. The new version performs read-ahead and write-behind
caching, allowing the Finder to write to a local volume while
reading from a remote volume (and vice-versa). The new version
also briefly caches some information from the desktop database
to avoid unnecessary hits to the disk.
<P>
Includes Apple Video Player 1.4.
<P>
<P><h3>Miscellaneous Fixes and Enhancements</h3>
 
<P>
The Shut Down warning, which appears during startup if the
computer was shut down improperly, dismisses itself after two
minutes so that startup isn't delayed when no one is around to
read the message.
<P>
<PRE>     Note: This warning can be turned off completely
           in the General Controls panel.

</PRE>Includes Macintosh Easy Open 1.1.2, which fixes delays when
dragging Finder folders.
<P>
The dialog box displayed after the keyboard Power key is
pressed dismisses itself (simulating a click on its Cancel
button) after one minute.
<P>
Fixes a problem with the Power key. In previous versions, if
the Power key was held down just a little too long, the
hardware could miss the release of the key. If the next key
pressed was the Command key, the hardware would mistakenly
think that Command-Power had been pressed and would bring up
the programmer's window (or MacsBug if it was installed).
<P>
Color Picker no longer crashes during startup. There is a
problem with certain third-party SCSI drivers that mark the
drive as removable at the beginning of startup and later mark
it as non-removable. Because Color Picker creates an alias to
itself during startup, the change to non-removable prevented
the Color Picker alias from being resolved later. Color Picker
now handles the failure to resolve this alias.
<P>
Fixes a problem introduced by System 7.5 Update 1.0 that
prevented 2-byte characters from being used when naming a DOS
disk.
<P>
Fixes a problem that allowed the Menu Manager to use an
unlocked handle. This fix will eliminate some crash problems,
especially when using certain pop-up menus.
<P>
Changes several video drivers to provide better support for
new monitors introduced since System 7.5 was released.
<P>
Handles low-memory situations better than previous releases of
Sound Manager.
<P>
Fixes a problem that allowed the sound volume to be lower
after restarting than it was before restarting; volume should
now be properly preserved when restarting.
<P>
The state of the Mute checkbox in the Sound control panel's
Volume window is now preserved across restarts.
<P>
Fixes a problem that allowed QuickDraw to leak about 50 bytes
of memory in some isolated circumstances.
<P>
Fixes a problem that allowed a nonexistent disk drive to show
up in Disk First Aid.
<P>
Fixes a crash problem in the Communications Toolbox that
happens if there are more than about 600 zones on a single
network. The new limit is just over 8000 zones.
<P>
Fixes a problem on the 630 and 5200 series computers that
would cause them to ignore the infrared remote control.
<P>
Fixes a problem that made it take two attempts to unmute the
sound using the infrared remote control on 630 and 5200 series
computers.
<P>
Presents a dialog box that advises users that audio CDs cannot
be shared if an audio CD is selected and the "Share a Folder"
or "Share a Folder (no Guest)" automated task is executed.
(In the past, the system would hang in this situation.)
<P>
Fixes a bug that caused the wrong font to be used in some
cases.
<P>
Fixes a problem that allowed a garbage pattern to be used when
redrawing the pattern in a scroll bar.
<P>
Fixes a problem with submenus drawn too large or not drawn at
all.
<P>
Fixes a problem that sometimes caused the startup progress bar
to draw improperly.
<P>
Fixes a problem in WorldScript Power Adapter that could cause
text to wrap randomly in Text Edit fields, or to appear
garbled.
<P>
Plugged a small memory leak that sometimes occurred when
resizing a window.
<P>
