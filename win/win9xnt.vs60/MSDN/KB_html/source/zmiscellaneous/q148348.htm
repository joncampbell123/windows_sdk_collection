The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 98
<LI>Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you upgrade to any of the Windows versions listed above, your dot-
matrix printer may seem to print slowly. In addition, the printer may no
longer print during each pass of the print head. The printer may print
only as the print head passes in one direction, not as the print head
passes in both directions.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These symptoms can occur for any of the following reasons:

<UL><LI>The document that you are printing contains TrueType fonts instead of
   printer fonts. Because TrueType fonts are sent to dot-matrix printers
   as graphics, they are printed in graphics mode, which is slow. If you
   were using primarily printer fonts with your previous version of
   Windows or Windows for Workgroups, and you are using primarily TrueType
   fonts with your current version of Windows, printing may seem slower.
<P>
   NOTE: Some of the printer drivers that are included with Windows 95 do
   not support printer fonts. When you are using one of these drivers,
   TrueType fonts are used in place of printer fonts. This may cause your
   documents to print slowly. If you were using a Windows 3.1 printer
   driver with your previous version of Windows or Windows for Workgroups,
   and you are using a printer driver that does not support printer fonts
   with Windows 95, printing may seem slower.

<LI>The print resolution, print quality, or printer font that your printer
   is configured to use is causing it to print only as the print head
   passes in one direction. Because the printer is no longer printing as
   the print head passes in both directions, printing may seem slower.

<LI>If you are using Windows 95, it may be configured to spool print jobs
   to your computer's hard disk until the printer is ready to print. This
   allows Windows 95 to return control to the program that you are
   printing from much faster, but it may cause overall printing speed
   (the amount of time that it takes for a document to be printed) to
   seem slower.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

<UL><LI>If the documents that you are printing contain TrueType fonts instead
   of printer fonts, you may want to use printer fonts in your documents
   instead of TrueType fonts. Printer fonts appear in font lists with a
   printer icon next to the font name. TrueType fonts appear in font lists
   with "TT" next to the font name.
<P>
   If printer fonts do not appear in font lists in programs that you
   print from, you may be using a Windows 95 printer driver that does not
   support printer fonts. To determine if this is the case, use the
   Windows 3.1 printer driver included with the printer instead of the
   printer driver included with Windows 95. For information about
   installing Windows 3.1 printer drivers in Windows 95, please see the
   following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win95x/q132946.htm">Q132946</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : How to Install Windows 3.1 Drivers in Windows 95

</PRE><LI>If your printer is printing only as the print head passes in one
   direction, configure your printer to use a lower print resolution or
   print quality, or a lower-quality printer font. For example, if your
   printer is currently configured to print in letter quality (LQ) mode,
   you may be able work around this problem by configuring it to print in
   draft mode instead.
<P>
   To modify the print resolution or print quality that your printer is
   configured to use when you are using a printer driver included with
   Windows 95, double-click the Printers icon in Control Panel, use the
   right mouse button to click the printer that you want to configure,
   click Properties, and then click the Graphics tab to modify the print
   resolution or the Device Options tab to modify the print quality.
<P>
   NOTE: Not all dot-matrix printers allow you to configure the print
   resolution and print quality in this manner. If the Graphics or Device
   Options tab does not appear on the property sheet for your printer, if
   you are using the Windows 3.1 printer driver included with the printer
   instead of the Windows 95 printer driver, or if you want to configure
   your printer to use a lower-quality printer font, contact the printer's
   manufacturer for information about configuring your printer.

<LI>If you are using Windows 95, configure it to print directly to the
   printer instead of spooling print jobs to your hard disk. Doing so may
   improve overall printing speed, but it may also increase the amount of
   time that it takes for Windows 95 to return control to the program you
   are printing from. To configure Windows 95 to print directly to the
   printer, follow these steps:
<P>
   1. In Control Panel, double-click Printers.
<P>
   2. Use the right mouse button to click the printer that you want to
<P><PRE>      configure, and then click Properties on the menu that appears.
</PRE><P>
   3. Click the Details tab.
<P>
   4. Click Spool Settings, click Print Directly To The Printer, and
<P><PRE>      then click OK.
</PRE><P>
   5. Click OK.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Most dot-matrix printers can be configured for three different print
resolutions and three different print qualities. For example, a typical
dot-matrix printer may offer 360, 180, and 90 dots per inch (dpi), and
letter quality, near letter quality (NLQ), and draft mode. Depending on
the printer you are using, certain combinations of print resolution and
print quality may cause the printer to print only as the print head passes
in one direction. This typically occurs at higher resolutions or at higher
print qualities, as the printer attempts to generate higher quality output
by gaining more control over placement of the print head.
<P>
For example, most dot-matrix printers print only as the print head passes
in one direction when they print at 360 dpi in LQ mode. These printers
typically print as the print head passes in both directions when they
print at 90 dpi in draft mode. When they print using any other combination
of print resolution and print quality, some printers may print only as the
print head passes in one direction, while others may print as the print
head passes in both directions.
<P>
In addition, some printers offer both LQ and NLQ printer fonts, and draft
printer fonts. When the LQ or NLQ printer fonts are used, the printer
typically prints only as the print head passes in one direction. When the
draft printer fonts are used, the printer typically prints as the print
head passes in both directions.
