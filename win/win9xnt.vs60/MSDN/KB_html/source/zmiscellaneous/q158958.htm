<P><h3>DirectX(tm) Setup</h3>
 
<PRE>Component         Version

Direct3D(tm)      4.04.00.0068    Certified
DirectDraw(tm)    4.04.00.0068    Certified
DirectSound(tm)   4.04.00.0068    Certified
DirectPlay(tm)    4.04.00.0068    Certified
DirectInput(tm)   4.04.00.0068    Certified
Old DirectPlay    4.03.00.1096    Certified
Audio driver      4.20.00.0095    Certified
Display driver    4.00.950        No hardware support

</PRE></OL>&lt;&gt;Direct3D Hardware Acceleration Enabled
&lt;Reinstall DirectX&gt;
&lt;Restore Audio drivers&gt;
&lt;Restore Display driver&gt;
<P>
NOTE: If you have Goosebumps: Escape from Horrorland installed
on your computer, Direct3D(tm)should be listed as version
4.04.00.0069 and Certified.
<P>
<P><h3>Component</h3>
 
<P>
There are two types of components:

<OL><P><LI>DirectX software modules, hereafter referred to as Direct(tm)
   components.

<P><LI>Audio and Display drivers. These are generally provided by the
   hardware vendors, although drivers for popular cards are included
   with DirectX on the game compact disc. These drivers are newer than
   those on the Windows 95 compact disc and are all certified for use with
   DirectX, meaning they will take advantage of advanced hardware
   acceleration features. However, they may not be the latest drivers
   available.
<P>
</OL><h3>Old DirectPlay</h3>
 
<P>
This line only appears if DirectX 1.0 or 2.0 was been installed. These
files are saved for compatibility.
<P>
<P><h3>Direct3D Hardware Acceleration Enabled</h3>
 
<P>
You can use this check box to turn the Direct3D hardware
acceleration on or off.
<P>
<P><h3>Reinstall DirectX</h3>
 
<P>
This button runs the DirectX file verification and driver update
routine again. This is useful when:

<UL><LI>The Direct(tm) components are not marked as "Certified"
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If the version numbers of the Direct(tm) components do not match.
<P>
</UL>Setup checks and updates old versions of the Direct(tm). It does not
overwrite newer DirectX files with older files.
<P>
Setup also checks the audio and display drivers, updating them if
there is a newer driver on the game compact disc.
<P>
<P><h3>Restore Drivers Buttons</h3>
 
<P>
The Restore Drivers buttons are only enabled if DirectX Setup has
previously upgraded either the audio or display driver. If you click the
button previous audio or video driver files are restored. This is useful if
the upgraded driver is causing problems in Windows or other Windows
applications.
<P>
<P><h3>Certified</h3>
 
<P>
Generally, the Direct components are all certified, unless special
third-party updates are used. Click the "Reinstall DirectX" button to
have Setup verify the versions.
<P>
NOTE: The "Display drivers" and "Audio drivers" do not need to be certified
- they can be regular Windows 95 version 4.0 drivers. However, for best
performance, a DirectX-certified driver is desirable. While the game CD-ROM
contains updated drivers for popular audio and display cards, newer
versions may be available from your hardware vendor. Click Reinstall
DirectX to have Setup check and if possible upgrade the driver. Or install
new drivers using the instructions provided by your hardware vendor.
<P>
<P><h3>No Hardware Support</h3>
 
<P>
This just means the video &amp; audio drivers are not DirectX-enabled so no
direct-hardware access will be performed. DirectX will emulate special
features in software, not hardware. For faster performance, obtain DirectX-
enabled drivers, if available, from your hardware vendor.
<P>
<P><h3>Version</h3>
 
<P>
For the Direct components, the version number listed signifies which
DirectX version the files are from. These should not be less than the
current version of DirectX installed. For instance, if you have DirectX 2.0
installed, none of the components should have a DirectX 1.0 version number.
Generally, the Direct components are all be of the same version
number, unless special third-party updates are being used. Click the
"Reinstall DirectX" button to have Setup verify the versions.
<P>
For the audio and display drivers, the versions do not need to match the
Direct components. These numbers do not directly correspond to the
DirectX version, but rather are hardware driver version numbers.
<P>
If a hardware driver is not DirectX-certified, no version number will be
reported. This does not mean the driver will not work with DirectX games.
<P>
<P><h3>Version Numbers</h3>
 
<P>
Here are the version numbers For Direct components:
<P>
<PRE>   DirectX 1.0       4.02.0095
   DirectX 2.0       4.03.00.1096
   DirectX 3.0       4.04.00.0068
