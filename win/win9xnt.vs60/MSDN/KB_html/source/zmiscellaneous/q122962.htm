The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You cannot print more than one PowerPoint file at a time using Find File.
This is different from the Find File dialog boxes in Microsoft Word 6.0
and the Microsoft Office Manager (MOM), which support selecting and
printing of multiple files.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
You cannot use Word 6.0 or MOM as a workaround. Word 6.0 tries to convert
the files to Word before printing them, and MOM gives the error "Sorry, you
cannot open a presentation during a slide show or when a dialog box is
showing." If you click OK, MOM goes ahead and prints the first presentation
and closes.
<P>
<P><h3>Macintosh Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
A workaround you can use for PowerPoint for the Macintosh, with the help of
QuickDrawGX, is to create a printer on the desktop. Select several
presentations with the mouse, and drag and drop them on the printer. This
method achieves the same result as "selecting multiple presentations...
printing or deleting" them.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
PowerPoint has a Find File command that you can use to search your drives
for specific files. This command is on the File menu. After you find the
files, you can open, print, or delete the files from within the Find File
dialog box. However, you cannot select a group of files by holding down the
CTRL or SHIFT key while you select the files, and, therefore, you cannot
open, print, or delete more than one file at a time.
