   TITLE     : Internet Explorer Security Breach Patch Available

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Fixes in Internet Explorer 3.0b and 3.01b</h3>
 
<P>
Internet Explorer 3.0b and 3.01b includes the following fixes:

<UL><LI>3.0a/3.01a Security Update: Fix for the "Cybersnot" bug. This patch
   causes Internet Explorer to prompt you with the following warning when
   you open a Windows shortcut or link (.lnk) or Internet shortcut
   (.url):
<P>
<P><PRE>      Opening:
      &lt;file&gt; from &lt;server&gt;
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Some files can contain viruses or otherwise be harmful to your
      computer. It is important to be certain that this file is from a
      trustworthy source. What would you like to do with this file?
</PRE><P>
   You are then prompted to either open the file or save it to disk. Note
   that the "Always ask before opening this type of file" option is
   disabled when you are opening .lnk and .url file types as a result of
   the 3.0b/3.01b  fix.
<P>
   If you have installed the 3.0a/3.01a patch, you should upgrade to
   Internet Explorer 3.0b or 3.01b. To determine whether the version of
   Internet Explorer that you are using has been updated with the
   3.0a/3.01a patch, click About Internet Explorer on the Help menu. One
   of the following versions is listed if you have updated to the
   3.0a/3.01a patch:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Version 3.0a (470.1155)
    - Version 3.0a (470.1158)
    - Version 3.01a (4.70.1215)
</PRE>
<LI>A fix for the MIT variation of the "Cybersnot" bug that causes
   Internet Explorer to prompt you with the same warning as the
   "Cybersnot" bug when you open any of the following "unsafe" file
   types:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Executable file (.exe)
    - Zip file (.zip)
    - MS-DOS batch file (.bat)
    - MS-DOS program information file (.pif)
    - Setup information file (.inf)
    - Windows registry file (.reg)
    - Windows NT command script file (.cmd)
    - Qbasic file (.bas)
    - Internet shortcut (.url)
    - Internet link (.lnk)
    - MS-DOS program file (.com)
</PRE><P>
   Note that the "Always ask before opening this type of file" option is
   disabled when you are opening any of the "unsafe" file types listed
   above as a result of the 3.0b/3.01b fix.
<P>
   When you open any file that is not on the "unsafe" list, Internet
   Explorer prompts you with same warning, but you are able to enable or
   disable the "Always ask before opening this type of file" option.

<LI>A fix for the "UMD" bug that causes Internet Explorer to prompt you
   with the following warning when you open any file from a shell
   (folder) view within Internet Explorer:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Some files can contain viruses or otherwise be harmful to your
      computer. It is important to be certain that this file is from a
      trustworthy source. Do you want to continue opening this file?
</PRE><P>
   If you click OK, the file opens; if you click Cancel, the operation
   stops and the file is not opened or downloaded.
<P>
   NOTE: This applies to "top-level browsing" using the Internet Explorer
   Address bar [that is, typing "C:\" or "\\&lt;server&gt;\&lt;share&gt;" (without
   quotation marks), where &lt;server&gt; is the computer and &lt;share&gt; is the
   folder or drive that contains the resources that you are accessing],
   or browsing local or remote folders in a frame on a Web page.

<LI>An update to the user agent string. The user agent string allows Web
   sites to detect the type of browser being used to access the site.
<P>
   After installing Internet Explorer 3.0b/3.01b, the user agent string
   reported is one of the following, depending on the version of Internet
   Explorer:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - 3.00 - NT - Mozilla/2.0 (compatible; MSIE 3.0; Update B;
      Windows NT)
    - 3.00 - Win95 - Mozilla/2.0 (compatible; MSIE 3.0; Update B; Windows
      95)
    - 3.01 - NT-Mozilla/2.0 (compatible; MSIE 3.01; Update B; Windows NT)
    - 3.01- Win95 - Mozilla/2.0 (compatible; MSIE 3.01; Update B; Windows
      95)
</PRE><P>
   If you are not running patch B, the user agent string returned for
   version 3.01 is "Mozilla/2.0 (compatible; MSIE 3.01; Windows 95)."
   Similarly, the user agent string for version 3.0 is "Mozilla/2.0
   (compatible; MSIE 3.0; Windows 95)."
