<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to troubleshoot video display problems or error
messages relating to the video display driver when you are starting or
using Windows 95 or Windows 98.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Video problems that occur when Windows is started normally, but do not
occur when Windows is started in Safe mode are usually related to the
display driver that Windows is attempting to use. To determine whether
you are using a Windows 3.1, Windows 95, or Windows 98 video driver,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to open the System.ini file in
   the Windows folder.

<P><LI>In the [Boot] section, search for the "Display=" line. If this line
   reads anything other than the following line, the driver you are using
   is designed for Windows 3.1 (or an earlier version of Windows):
<P>
<P><PRE>      Display.drv=Pnpdrvr.drv
</PRE><P>
</OL>If you are using a video driver designed for Windows 95 or Windows 98, go
to the "Advanced Graphics Settings" section in this article. Otherwise,
continue with the following section.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows 3.1 Display Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
If no Windows 95 or Windows 98 display driver is available for your video
adapter, try using the Windows 3.1 drivers available from the adapter's
manufacturer. Consult the documentation included with that driver for
information about how to install the driver.
<P>
NOTE: If you use a Windows 3.1 display driver in Windows 95 or Windows 98,
you cannot use new Graphics Device Interface (GDI) features such as:

<UL><LI>Animated cursors. For information about using animated cursors, please
   see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win95x/q123334.htm">Q123334</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Requirements for Animated Cursors

</PRE><LI>Dynamic resolution changes. In many circumstances, you can change the
   video resolution in Windows 95 and Windows 98 without restarting
   Windows. If you change the color depth or the video driver you are
   using, you must restart Windows.

<LI>VGA fallback mode. If Windows detects a problem with the video card
   or video driver, it restarts with the VGA driver.

<LI>The Windows 95 or Windows 98 virtual flat frame buffer device
   (Vflatd.vxd). Vflatd.vxd provides a frame buffer that can be up to 1 MB
   in size. Windows 3.1 video drivers are limited to a 64K frame buffer
   that affects your available system resources.
<P>
</UL>If the Windows 3.1 display driver does not work properly in Windows 95 or
Windows 98, use the standard VGA driver included with Windows 95 and
Windows 98. To do so, use the appropriate method:
<P>
Windows 95:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-
   click Display.

<P><LI>Click the Settings tab, and then click Change Display Type.

<P><LI>Click the Change button in the Adapter Type section, and then click
   Show All Devices.

<P><LI>In the Manufacturers box, click (Standard Display Types).

<P><LI>In the Models box, click Standard Display Adapter (VGA), click OK,
   and then click Close.

<P><LI>Click Close.
<P>
</OL>Windows 98:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-
   click Display.

<P><LI>Click the Settings tab, and then click Advanced.

<P><LI>Click the Adapter tab, and then click Change.

<P><LI>Click Next, click "Display a list of all the drivers in a specific
   location, so you can select the driver you want," and then click Next.

<P><LI>Click Show All Devices.

<P><LI>4. In the Manufacturers box, click (Standard Display Types).

<P><LI>In the Models box, click Standard Display Adapter (VGA), click OK,
   and then click Next.

<P><LI>Click Next, click Next, and then click Finish.

<P><LI>Click Close, click Close again, and then click Yes to restart your
   computer.
<P>
</OL>If you continue to experience problems, continue with the following
section.
<P>
<P><h3>Advanced Graphics Settings</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 and Windows 98 has a built-in method for troubleshooting video
problems. There is a slider you can adjust to change the way Windows uses
the video card. It is a good idea to start with the setting on the right
(the Full setting) and move the slider one setting to the left until you
find the setting that works best. To use the slider to change the way
Windows uses the video card, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click System.

<P><LI>Click the Performance tab, and then click the Graphics.

<P><LI>Note that the Hardware Acceleration slider has four settings (Full,
   Most, Basic, and None). Each of these settings is described below.
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Full
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      This is the default setting and allows for full hardware
      acceleration.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Most:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      This setting adds the following items:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       - SWCursor=1 to the [Display] section of the System.ini file.
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         Setting SWCursor to 1 disables the hardware cursor.

         NOTE: This setting is similar to using the /Y switch with some
         versions of the MS-DOS-level Microsoft Mouse driver.

      The Most setting applies to Western Digital (WD) or S3-compatible
      drivers. If you have problems with the way the mouse pointer appears
      on the screen, try this setting.

    - Basic:

      This setting adds the following items:

       - SafeMode=1 to the [Windows] section of the Win.ini file.

         Setting SafeMode to 1 allows for basic acceleration only (for
         example, pattern bit block transfer [bitblt] and screen-to-screen
         bitblt).

       - MMIO=0 to the [Display] section of the System.ini file.

         Setting MMIO to 0 disables memory-mapped I/O for S3-compatible
         drivers.

       - SWCursor=1 to the [Display] section of the System.ini file.

         Setting SWCursor to 1 disables the hardware cursor.

      Try the Basic setting if your computer seems to stop responding
      (hang) randomly and you have an S3-compatible video driver.

    - None:

      This setting adds the following items:

       - SafeMode=2 to the [Windows] section of the Win.ini file.

         Setting SafeMode to 2 disables all video card acceleration (for
         example, the GDI calls the device-independent bitmap [DIB] engine
         directly for screen drawing, rather than using the display
         driver).

       - MMIO=0 to the [Display] section of the System.ini file.

         Setting MMIO to 0 disables memory-mapped I/O for S3-compatible
         drivers.

       - SWCursor=1 to the [Display] section of the System.ini file.

         Setting SWCursor to 1 disables the hardware cursor.

      Try the None setting if your computer seems to hang randomly, you
      have an S3-compatible video driver, and the Basic setting does not
      resolve the problem.

<P><h3>Eliminate Memory Conflicts</h3>
 
<P>
Determine whether the problem is a result of a conflicting driver in
memory. For information about how to do so, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

               Messages

</PRE></OL>If you continue to experience problems, continue with the following
section.
<P>
<P><h3>Verify Valid Driver Files</h3>
 
<P>
To verify that the display adapter driver files are valid, use the
appropriate method:
<P>
Windows 95:
<P>
Run Windows 95 Setup again and choose the Verify option when you are
prompted. The Verify option causes Windows 95 to check all files and
replace any that are missing or damaged.
<P>
Windows 98:
<P>
Run the Windows 98 System File Checker tool. To start the System File
Checker tool, click Start, click Run, type "sfc.exe" (without quotation
marks) in the Open box, and then click OK.
<P>
For information about how to use the System File Checker tool to extract
a file, click Start, click Help, click the Index tab, type "system file"
without quotation marks), double-click the "System File Checker" topic,
click Using System File Checker and then click Display.
<P>
If you continue to experience problems, continue with the following
section.
<P>
<P><h3>Contact the Manufacturer of the Display Adapter</h3>
 
<P>
If none of these troubleshooting steps correct the problem, contact the
display adapter's manufacturer for information about obtaining an updated
Windows 95 or Windows 98 driver.
