<PRE>  Margins         Yes         Yes          Word margins are measured from
                                           the paper's edge to body text;
                                           WordPerfect margins are measured
                                           from the edge to the header. The
                                           conversion adjusts the margins
                                           as needed to preserve page
                                           layout. If problems are
                                           experienced with margins (for
                                           example, if they are set outside
                                           the printable range in Word),
                                           choose Page Setup from the File
                                           menu, select the Margins tab,
                                           and click OK. If margins need to
                                           be adjusted, Word will ask to
                                           fix them.

</PRE>*Numbering/Outline features:
<P>
WordPerfect's Numbering/Outlining features are converted to SEQ (sequence)
fields in Word by default. To convert WordPerfect's Numbering/Outline
features to Word's paragraph numbering features, follow the steps below:

<OL><P><LI>From the Windows Program Manager, run File Manager, select the file
   Mstxtcnv.ini (located in your Windows directory), and choose Open from
   the File menu. The Mstxtcnv.ini file is opened into Windows Notepad.

<P><LI>In Mstxtcnv.ini, locate the section titled [WordPerfect5Conv]. Add the
   following entry on a new line after the last existing entry in the
   section:
<P>
<P><PRE>       FavourSequenceFields=No
</PRE>
<P><LI>Choose Save from the Windows Notepad File menu, and exit Notepad and
   File Manager.
<P>
</OL>Now when you convert WordPerfect 5.x documents, WordPerfect's numbering
features will be converted to Word's numbering features.
<P>
<P><h3>Note on Round-Trip Conversions</h3>
 
<P>
Converting a document from Word format to WordPerfect format and back again
may cause the loss of some formatting (for example, fonts, justification,
styles, and mail merge) unless you load, paginate, and save the converted
document in WordPerfect before converting back to Word.

The information in this article is derived from the WPCONV.DOC document
that is installed by the Supplemental WordPerfect Conversions Kit in the
