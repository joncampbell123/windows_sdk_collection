<P>
<PRE> ---------------------------------------------------------------------
</PRE>The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows 98
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
During the first reboot in Windows 95 Setup, you may receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Invalid system disk
   Replace the disk, and then press any key

</PRE>You may also receive this error message when you boot from the startup
disk.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message may be caused by one of the following situations:

<UL><LI>The system is infected with a boot-sector virus. This error is known
   to be caused by the AntiCMOS.A virus.

<LI>The system is running virus-protection software.

<LI>The system is using hard disk management software (such as Disk
   Manager, EZ-Drive, or DrivePro) for hard disk geometry translation.
   These tools provide support for hard disks with more than 1024
   cylinders.

<LI>Setup was unable to copy the system files to the hard drive.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use one of the following methods to correct the problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Systems Infected with a Virus</h3>
 
<P>
Use an anti-virus program to detect and remove the virus, and then
reinstall Windows 95. Boot-sector viruses infect computer systems by
copying code either to the boot sector on a floppy disk or the partition
table on a hard disk. During startup, the virus is loaded into memory.
Once in memory, the virus infects any non-infected disks accessed by the
system.
<P>
<P><h3>Systems Running Virus-Protection Software</h3>
 
<P>
Boot the system using the startup disk created during Windows 95 Setup.
Use the SYS command from the startup disk to restore the system files to
the hard disk.
<P>
Some computers use built-in anti-virus software that must be disabled 
in the computer's CMOS settings. For information about changing CMOS 
settings, consult the computer's documentation or manufacturer.
<P>
<P><h3>Systems Using Disk Management Software</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 may not in some cases detect disk management software and
may overwrite the master boot record (MBR) information. Refer to the
documentation for the disk management software you are using for
information about restoring the MBR.
<P>
Also, check the Setuplog.txt file for the following statement:
<P>
<PRE>   FSLog: BIOS Heads=:64:, BootPart Heads=:64:

</PRE>The number above (64 in this example) may vary from computer to computer.
If these two numbers are different, replace the system files on your hard
disk according to the instructions in the "Reinstall the Windows 95 system
files" section below.
<P>
<P><h3>Reinstall the Windows 95 System Files</h3>
 
<P>
CAUTION: If you are using Disk Manager or any other disk drive overlay
program on a hard disk, make sure that the overlay driver is loaded before
you use the SYS command on that hard disk. If the overlay driver is not
loaded and you use the SYS command on the hard disk, the drive may not be
recognized as being partitioned by the disk drive overlay program and you
could experience a data loss or inability to boot from the drive.

<OL><P><LI>Boot the system using the Windows 95 Emergency Boot Disk.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following lines:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:
      cd\windows\command
      attrib c:\msdos.sys -s -h -r
      copy c:\msdos.sys c:\msdos.xxx
      a:
      sys c:
      attrib c:\msdos.sys -s -h -r
      del c:\msdos.sys
      copy c:\msdos.xxx c:\msdos.sys
      attrib c:\msdos.sys +s +h +r
</PRE>
<P><LI>Remove the disk and reboot the computer.
