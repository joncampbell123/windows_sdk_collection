<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article provides detailed instructions about how to install the
most recent version of DirectX.
<P>
DirectX is an extension of the Microsoft Windows 95 operating system
designed to provide Windows-based games and multimedia-rich programs
with high-performance, real-time access to available hardware on
current computer systems. This results in faster and better performing
Windows-based games and multimedia-rich programs.
<P>
DirectX 5.0 works best with updated audio and display drivers that
include hardware acceleration features. DirectX 5.0 includes updated
drivers for the most popular sound and video adapters. For many older
sound and video adapters, these are the most recent drivers available.
If you are using recently manufactured sound and video adapters, you
can contact your hardware manufacturer to inquire about obtaining more
recent DirectX-compatible drivers for your sound and video adapters.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To download and install the most recent version of DirectX, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start your Web browser, and connect to the following Microsoft Web
   site:
<P>
<P><PRE>      <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx">http://www.microsoft.com/directx</A></B>
</PRE>
<P><LI>Scroll down the page until you see the DirectX 5.0 For End Users
   section. Click the Download Your Copy link in this section.

<P><LI>Click the appropriate link for your language version of Windows 95,
   and then click the link to download the file.

<P><LI>Click Save this Program To Disk, and then click OK. We recommend this
   option because the DirectX installation file remains available on your
   hard drive in case you need to reinstall DirectX at a later time.
<P>
   Note the name of the file, so that you can find it on your hard drive
   when the download is complete.

<P><LI>Save the file to your favorite download folder. If you are not sure
   where to save it, we suggest "C:\". For example, if you download the
   English language version of DirectX, type "C:\dx5eng.exe" (including
   the quotation marks) in the File Name box, and then click Save.

<P><LI>When the download is complete, click OK, and then quit your Web
   browser.

<P><LI>Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

<P><LI>In the named box, type the name of the DirectX installation file.

<P><LI>In the Look In box, click the drive onto which you downloaded the
   DirectX installation file, and then click Find Now.

<P><LI>In the list of found files, double-click the DirectX installation
   file, and then follow the instructions on the screen to install the
   most recent version of DirectX on your computer.
