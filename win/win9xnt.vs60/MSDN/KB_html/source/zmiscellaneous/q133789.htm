<P>
Microsoft offers an Application Note titled "WT1229: Getting Started
Controlling Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95 Through OLE Automation"
that provides information to get you started on taking full advantage of
the new object model in the Microsoft PowerPoint presentation graphics
program for Windows 95.
<P>
PowerPoint for Windows 95 is an OLE Automation server and can be controlled
from any program that is an OLE controller, such as the Microsoft Visual
Basic programming system, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Project, or Microsoft
Access. What this means is that PowerPoint can become an integral member of
any Office solution that you or your company develops.
