This article explains how Microsoft is using Microsoft Windows NT systems
to provide large-scale customer support through the Internet.
 
<P>
<P><h2>HISTORY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft first established a public ftp server (ftp.microsoft.com) during
the summer of 1993. During the first six months of operation, it handled
about 280,000 anonymous logons. Use of this server increased dramatically
as Internet popularity grew, and through the first half of 1994 the server
was handling 250,000 anonymous logons per month and the T1 line (1.5
million bits per second) it used to reach the Internet became saturated.
Microsoft examined the situation and decided to expand the services
offered over the Internet.
<P>
Microsoft established three new Internet servers--each one an expandable
multi-processor Windows NT version 3.5 server capable of handling millions
of requests per month. To ensure adequate bandwidth for customer access to
the servers, the T1 line was upgraded to a T3 line capable of 45 million
bits per second.
<P>
<P><h2>CURRENT SERVICES</h2>
 
<P>
The three key services being provided are FTP, Gopher, and World Wide Web.
<P>
<P><h3>FTP Service</h3>
 
<P>
The server ftp.microsoft.com allows anyone to log on as "anonymous" with
their full email name as the password. It uses the FTP server software
included with Windows NT. There are banner files and readme files in many
of the directories, and a partial directory listing (LS-LR.ZIP) in the
root. Be sure to use binary mode (type "bin" to set binary mode) when
downloading binary files such as those with .ZIP or .EXE extensions. You
must have write permission in your current local working directory, or you
will receive "access denied" errors when you try to "get" files. Usage
instructions for ftp client software should be provided in the
documentation, and your local network administrator may be able to help
you.
<P>
More information on customizing the ftp server service is in this document:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-docs/papers/tcpipnt.zip">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-docs/papers/tcpipnt.zip</A></B>

</PRE>Knowledge Base articles are available in the KB directory for each product,
and the entire Software Library is under /Softlib. The readme files contain
instructions for locating specific drivers or articles.
<P>
<P><h2>GOPHER SERVICE</h2>
 
<P>
Internet Gopher services are available from gopher.microsoft.com on port
70. Gopher is a protocol that facilitates browsing and locating information
over a network. Gopher client and server software for many platforms
(including Microsoft Windows) is available in the public domain. Microsoft
is using public domain Gopher server software developed by the European
Microsoft Windows NT Academic Centre (EMWAC). The server software and more
information on its use can be found at emwac.ed.ac.uk in the directory
pub/gophers.
<P>
The Microsoft Gopher server contains over 50,000 Knowledge Base articles
complete with full text search indexing. Simply click your way through
the Knowledge Base article menu to a specific product, then select a search
menu. Type in a keyword and all articles for that product are searched for
it. A list of articles matching the search word is returned, and clicking
on one of the displayed titles downloads that article for display. The
top-level item "Welcome to the Microsoft Gopher Server" has instructions
and updated information.
<P>
<P><h2>WORLD WIDE WEB SERVICE</h2>
 
<P>
HTTP (or HyperText Transfer Protocol) is widely used on the Internet for
publishing information with links to other items. It is often referred to
as a HyperMedia service because it allows pointers to different media
items: text, pictures, sounds, movies, etc. The Microsoft World Wide Web
server named, www.microsoft.com contains information on the company's
products and strategies. The home page (or top-level display) on the server
also has pointers to ftp.microsoft.com and gopher.microsoft.com, so it
makes an ideal entry-point to Internet services at Microsoft. Microsoft is
using public domain HTTP server software developed by the European
Microsoft Windows NT Academic Centre (EMWAC). The server software and more
information on its use can be found at emwac.ed.ac.uk in the directory
pub/https.
<P>
Several public domain HTTP clients are available for many platforms
including Microsoft Windows. One of the more popular ones, MOSAIC, is a
multi-protocol browser that allows you to access any of the common Internet
services from a GUI interface. This means that the client can attach to
www.microsoft.com and view the homepage, then follow links to information
on any of the other servers. Some of the links even point to servers
elsewhere on the Internet.
<P>
<P><h2>FOR ASSISTANCE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft cannot provide end user assistance on the use of public domain
clients to reach our servers. Please consult your client software
documentation or vendor as needed. We welcome suggestions for content,
reports of apparent server-end problems, and general comments.
Send them to these email addresses:
<P>
<PRE>   FTP:    ftp@microsoft.com

   Gopher: gopher@microsoft.com

   HTTP:   www@microsoft.com

</PRE>Due to volume, individual email responses usually are not possible. All
mail is read, but these are not product support aliases. For information on
product support see MSNBRO.TXT in the root of ftp.microsoft.com.
