<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes setup and troubleshooting tips that you can use for
SCSI controllers in Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Setting Up SCSI Adapters in Windows</h3>
 
<P>
Before installing the Windows protected-mode drivers for your SCSI
adapter, make sure the adapter is working in a real-mode configuration.
Verify that the drivers for the adapter are loading in the Config.sys
and/or Autoexec.bat files. Once the adapter is working correctly in real
mode you can set up its protected-mode drivers.
<P>
To install a Windows protected-mode SCSI controller driver, run the Add
New Hardware Wizard from Control Panel. Windows currently supports SCSI
and SCSI 2 adapter types. If Windows cannot detect your SCSI adapter,
manually select your adapter from the list of SCSI controllers in the Add
New Hardware Wizard.
<P>
If your controller card is not listed, Windows does not currently
support it. Windows will not load protected-mode drivers for the adapter
and you must use real-mode drivers. You may want to contact the card
manufacturer to see if a protected-mode driver is available for Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Plug and Play SCSI Specifications</h3>
 

<UL><LI>The adapter must support at least the SCAM level 1 protocol for
   automatic SCSI ID assignment. SCAM (SCSI Configured Automatically)
   refers to a proposal for the SCSI-3 interface standard.

<LI>Automatic termination of the SCSI bus by the SCSI controller must
   occur.
<P>
</UL>SCSI controllers that do not meet these requirements may be compatible
with Windows but are not supported with Plug and Play functionality.
<P>
<P><h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
 
<P>
One of the first steps in troubleshooting is to remove a conflicting
device driver and reinstall it in Device Manager. An exclamation point in
a yellow circle or an "X" in a red circle in Device Manager indicates a
potential hardware conflict or a device that has been disabled. Restart
Windows in Safe mode and remove any conflicting SCSI device drivers in
Device Manager. Restart Windows normally and start the Add New Hardware
Wizard by double-clicking the Add New Hardware icon in Control Panel.
<P>
If you are still experiencing problems, check the following items:

<UL><LI>The SCSI bus must be configured properly for Windows to load
   protected-mode drivers. The configuration of a SCSI bus can be
   separated into the two following processes:
<P>
   1. Configuring the SCSI bus itself. This includes terminating
<P><PRE>      both ends of the SCSI bus, setting the Logical Unit Number (LUN),
      and setting the device IDs. The LUN is used to designate which
      SCSI controller is being accessed in a system with more than one
      controller being used. The SCSI device ID is similar, but is
      the designation for multiple devices on one controller.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Check to make sure that termination is correct. Incorrect
      termination is a common problem when setting up SCSI devices.
      Consult the SCSI controller manual or manufacturer for details on
      configuring your SCSI bus.
</PRE><P>
   2. Configuring the SCSI host adapter. This includes assigning its IRQ
<P><PRE>      line, DMA channel, UMB range, and so on. Consult the SCSI controller
      manual or manufacturer for details.
</PRE>
<LI>Most ASPI-compliant cards have an option to enable or disable their
   boot ROM BIOS. Enabling the BIOS makes the SCSI drive bootable.
   However, SCSI drives are commonly used as a secondary disk subsystems
   (with the traditional IDE/ATA drive serving as the boot disk
   subsystem). Disable the BIOS if the computer does not boot from the
   SCSI drive.

<LI>If the SCSI card works in MS-DOS but is not fully functional in Windows
   95 using the protected-mode drivers, look at the parameters in the
   real-mode driver line in the Config.sys file and modify the
   switches or parameters on the Settings tab in Device Manager. The
   Windows drivers support only the switches and parameters supported by
   the real-mode drivers provided by the manufacturer.

<LI>Windows may have problems switching from real-mode drivers to
   protected-mode drivers with untested third-party real-mode drivers.
   Temporarily disable the real-mode drivers in the Config.sys and/or
   Autoexec.bat files by placing the word "rem" (without quotation marks)
   at the beginning of the driver lines. Restart Windows and try
   accessing the SCSI drive or check Device Manager for non-functioning
   devices.

<LI>Examine the Bootlog.txt file. Check the following items:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Are the SCSI drivers being initialized properly?
    - Can the SCSI drive be accessed at all?
    - Is a Windows protection error (WPE) received and is a
      SCSI VxD/MPD/PDR the last entry in the file?
