<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you remove a sound card from your computer and remove the sound
card in Device Manager, the joystick (game) port on the sound card still
appears in Device Manager.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There is no parent-child relationship between the sound card and the
joystick port. Therefore, when you remove the sound card in Device Manager,
the joystick port is not automatically removed.
<P>
In addition, because the virtual joystick device driver (Vjoyd.vxd) cannot
normally detect whether the joystick port has been removed or the joystick
port is present but has no joystick attached, the driver is always active.
Therefore, when the hardware in your computer is detected, detection is not
run on the joystick port.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You can manually remove the joystick port in Device Manager by following
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click My Computer, then click Properties
   on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>Click the Device Manager tab.

<P><LI>Double-click the Sound, Video, And Game Controllers branch to expand
   it.

<P><LI>Click the joystick port, then click Remove.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
