The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Works for Windows version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Works for Windows 3.0 on a floppy-drive-only workstation,
and choose a Program Group for Works, Setup checks for the necessary disk
space and then displays the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Not enough space on Drive C:

</PRE>The dialog box indicates that the space required/needed on drive C is 4K.
Setup uses this disk space, which in Works version 3.0 must be available on
a drive designated as drive C, to modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS
files. Because diskless workstations by definition do not have a C drive,
you will need to create one by mapping to a network server as drive C,
using the workaround below, or upgrade to Works for Windows version 3.0a or
3.0b (full disk set required).
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Works version 3.0 for
Windows. This problem was corrected in Works version 3.0a for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: After you have completed the following steps, you can connect
to the server where the Works shared files (files installed by SETUP /A)
were installed, and run SETUP.EXE from there. The Works user's directory
itself can be installed to any available share.

<OL><P><LI>From the workstation, log on to a server.

<P><LI>From an MS-DOS prompt on the workstation, map (connect) to a network
   server as drive C. If you are on a Novell network, use the following
   command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      map root c:=&lt;server volume&gt;:&lt;subdirectory&gt;
</PRE><P>
   For example, to map to the USER\TEMP subdirectory on the default
   login server, type
<P>
<P><PRE>      map root c:=sys:user\temp
</PRE><P>
   where temp is an actual subdirectory on the server in the user
   directory.

<P><LI>Copy the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files from the startup floppy
   disk to logical drive C (in the directory mapped in step 2).
<P>
   If you skip this step, Setup will run, but will display the error
   message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Could not rename the file 'C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT' to
      'C:\AUTOEXEC.BAK'.
</PRE><P>
   You could choose the Ignore button at this point, and the
   installation would finish, but an AUTOEXEC.BAT file with only one
   line (the Share command) would be created.

<P><LI>Make sure that Share (SHARE.EXE) is available on the startup disk,
   and that the boot disk is in the floppy disk drive.

<P><LI>Run the Works workstation Setup program. Note that Works itself does
   not need to be installed on the same share (drive C).

<P><LI>Copy AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS back to the startup disk and make
   sure that the Share statement is similar to the following before
   restarting your system:
<P>
<P><PRE>      A:\SHARE.EXE /L:500 /F:5100
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: Share must be positioned in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file somewhere
   above a command that starts Windows or any menu program.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
After Setup displays the "Not enough space" message, four options are
available: Change Options, Install Now, Exit Setup, and Help. The Change
Options command isn't pertinent because the only option listed, Custom
Options, refers to the temporary file and is required. If you select
Install Now, Setup will appear to continue successfully, but eventually the
following error message will be displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not open the file named C:\AUTOEXEC.TMP.

</PRE></OL>At this point Setup is incomplete, with no program icons installed, so the
best thing to do is reinstall using the map root workaround above, or its
equivalent.
<P>
Note that the Works administrator's installation can be done without
access to drive C.
<P>
For more information about the map root or other Novell commands, see your
Novell documentation.
