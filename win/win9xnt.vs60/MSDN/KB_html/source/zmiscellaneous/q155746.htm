<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0, 7.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This articles discusses how to automatically install (register) a converter
in the versions of Word listed at the beginning of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To automatically install (register) a converter in the versions of Word
listed at the beginning of this article, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the converter file you want to install to either the Word program
   folder or the \Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Textconv
   folder.

<P><LI>Start Word.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Open.

<P><LI>Select a file that Word cannot recognize (for example, a plain text
   file or a document in the format supported by the converter that you
   installed).
<P>
</OL>Word will detect and automatically register the converter in one of two
locations in Windows 95 Registration Database:
<P>
Word 7.x:
 
<P>
<PRE>   \HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Word\7.0\Text Converters

   \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Shared Tools\Text Converters

</PRE></OL><h3>Word 97:</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_USERS\.Default\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word\Text Converters

</PRE>It is not necessary to complete steps 1 and 2 during the first file open in
a Word session. Also the "Confirm Conversions at Open" option (located on
the General tab of the Options command on the Tools menu) does not have to
be checked during this process.
<P>
One of the following occurs upon opening a foreign file in Word 7.0:

<OL><P><LI>If the "Confirm Conversions at Open" option (located on the General tab
   of the Options command on the Tools menu) is not checked (the Word 7.0
   default), Word will immediately open your document using the matching
   supported and installed converter.

<P><LI>If the file is a text file, Word will immediately open the file as Text
   Only.

<P><LI>If the file is of some other format not recognized by Word, and the
   "Confirm Conversion at Open" option is not check, the Convert File From
   dialog box will appear anyway, proposing to open the document as Text
   Only. Click Cancel and only open documents supported by the available
   converters.
<P>
   NOTE: If the FileOpen command has been modified in some way, the
   Convert File From dialog box may be bypassed. The macro intercepts the
   Convert File From dialog box and defaults to opening the file as Text
   Only, resulting in garbage characters. To display the Convert File From
   dialog box, select Confirm Conversions before opening the file.

<P><LI>If the Confirm Conversions option is checked, Word will prompt to open
   the document from the format supported by one of the installed
   converters or will prompt to open the file as Text Only if the file is
   plain text or another format not recognized by any of the installed
   converters or internally by Winword.exe.
<P>
   NOTE: All converters that are made available for use with Word 7.0,
   with the exception of the AmiPro and Enable converters, are shipped
   with Word 7.0 and Microsoft Office 95. Setup should be used to add and
   remove converters that are supplied with the product.
