<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists troubleshooting tips you can use to help resolve
problems with floppy disk drives in Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are having problems with a floppy disk drive (such as receiving the
error message "Error reading drive &lt;X&gt;:"), try the troubleshooting tips in
the following sections.
<P>
<P><h3>Safe Mode</h3>
 
<P>
Start Windows in Safe mode and try to access the floppy disk drive. To
start Windows 95 in Safe mode, restart your computer, press the F8 key
when you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, and then choose Safe Mode
from the Startup menu. To start Windows 98 in Safe mode, restart your
computer, press and hold down the CTRL key after your computer completes
the Power On Self Test (POST), and then choose Safe Mode from the Startup
menu. For more information about Windows 98 startup, see the following
article in the
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../zzmiscellaneous/q178548.htm">Q178548</A></B>
      TITLE     : No "Starting Windows 98" Message at Startup

</PRE>If you can access the floppy disk drive, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click My Computer, then click Properties
   on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>Click the Device Manager tab.

<P><LI>Double-click Floppy Disk Controllers.

<P><LI>Click the floppy disk controller for the drive you are having problems
   with, then click Properties.

<P><LI>Click the Original Configuration (Current) check box to clear it. This
   disables the Windows protected-mode driver for the floppy disk drive
   controller.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Restart Windows normally.
<P>
</OL>If you can access the floppy disk drive successfully after following the
above steps, the following conditions may be true:

<UL><LI>The floppy disk drive controller may not be supported in protected
   mode.

<LI>There are drivers loading in the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file that
   may be necessary for protected-mode access.

<LI>There are drivers loading in the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file that
   may be causing conflicts in Windows and need to be disabled.
<P>
</UL>If you still cannot access the floppy disk drive after following steps
1-7, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use the right mouse button to click My Computer, then click Properties
   on the menu that appears.

<P><LI>Click the Device Manager tab.

<P><LI>Double-click Floppy Disk Controllers.

<P><LI>Click the floppy disk controller, and then click Remove to remove the
   controller.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Add New Hardware.

<P><LI>Click Next, and then click Yes to allow Windows to detect the hardware
   in your computer.

<P><LI>When the Add New Hardware Wizard is finished, restart the computer
   and try to access the floppy disk drive again.
<P>
</OL>Redetecting the floppy disk controller should resolve any addressing
problems with the controller by detecting the correct address range. If
the floppy disk controller is not detected correctly, there may be a
problem with the hard disk controller. If the floppy disk controller is
redetected but you still cannot access the floppy disk drive, there may be
a problem with the floppy disk.
<P>
<P><h3>Damaged Disks</h3>
 
<P>
Use the following steps to check for a damaged disk:

<OL><P><LI>Use a disk utility (such as ScanDisk) to test the disk for damage.
<P>
   NOTE: Do not use a non-Windows 95 or Windows 98-aware disk utility on
   DMF disks. Non-Windows 95 or Windows 98-aware disk utilities can damage
   DMF disks. The Windows ScanDisk tool recognizes and does not damage DMF
   disks.
<P>
   Before you run a disk utility, please see the following article in
   the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win95x/q120442.htm">Q120442</A></B>
<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Using Hard Disk Utilities with Windows 95

</PRE><P><LI>Type the following command at an MS-DOS command prompt
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;\*.* nul
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive you are having problems with.
   For example, if you are having problems with drive A, insert a disk
   you are having problems with in drive A and type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\*.* nul
</PRE><P>
   This command copies the files on the disk to a null device. If there
   is a problem copying the files, error messages appear on the screen.
<P>
</OL><h3>CMOS Settings</h3>
 
<P>
Consult your computer's documentation or manufacturer to make sure that
your computer's CMOS settings are correct.
<P>
<P><h3>Irwin Tape Backup</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 Setup removes the following statement from the [386Enh] section
of the SYSTEM.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   device=&lt;path&gt;\VIRWT.386

</PRE></OL>If you re-install the Irwin Tape Backup software after you install Windows
95, this statement is placed in the SYSTEM.INI file again and can cause
conflicts with floppy disk access in Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Device Conflicts</h3>
 
<P>
Device conflicts as reported by Device Manager can cause problems reading
from and writing to floppy disks. You can resolve this problem by changing
or removing the resources from Device Manager that are causing the
conflict. These are typically conflicts with hard drive controller cards,
video cards, or COM ports.
