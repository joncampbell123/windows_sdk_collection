The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you save a document from Word 6.x for Windows or Word 6.x for the
Macintosh in WordPerfect 5.x format, the document may in rare instances
become corrupt, and you will not be able to reopen the document in Word or
WordPerfect.

<UL><LI>If you try to reopen the document in Word, the following error message
   results:
<P>
<P><PRE>      File cannot be converted because of password protection
</PRE>
<LI>If you try to reopen the document into WordPerfect 5.x or 6.x for DOS 
   or Windows, a dialog box appears indicating the file is password 
   protected, and WordPerfect prompts you to enter a password. 
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In some instances, Word's WordPerfect converter incorrectly sets the
Encryption Key in a WordPerfect document when exporting as WordPerfect 5.x
format.
<P>
The Encryption Key is composed of 2 bytes: the thirteenth and fourteenth
bytes in a WordPerfect file. If a document has not actually been password
protected, these bytes should always be set to 0 (zero). In reported cases
where a document saved from Word can no longer be opened, the thirteenth
byte has been incorrectly set to a value of 78.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you have access to a hexadecimal editor, such as Norton Commander,
change the value of the thirteenth byte in affected WordPerfect documents
to 0 (zero). Resave the document with a new name, and attempt to open the
document in Word or WordPerfect.
<P>
If after making this change the document opens successfully, the file was 
indeed incorrectly exported from Word. If Word and WordPerfect still prompt 
for a password, the document was at some point opened in WordPerfect and is 
actually password protected. In such case, you will not be able to open the 
document into Word (by design), and you will only be able to reopen the 
document in WordPerfect if you have access to the document password. 
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
The only known cause of this problem has been corrected in Word 6.0 for
Windows NT, Word 7.0 for Windows 95 and Windows NT, and in the kit release
of the WordPerfect 5.x converter for use with Word 6.x for Windows.
