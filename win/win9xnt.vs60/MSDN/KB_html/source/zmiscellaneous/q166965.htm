The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Access versions 7.0, 97
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.
<P>
This article contains an example that shows you how to refresh linked
tables in your database using the Common Dialog control that is available
with Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools or the Microsoft Access
Developer's Toolkit version 7.0.
<P>
For an example of a different method to relink tables that uses Windows
application programming interface (API) functions, refer to the Developer
Solutions sample application (Solutions.mdb) included with Microsoft Access
7.0 and 97. Open the Solutions.mdb database, select "Use multiple
databases" in the "Select a Category of Examples" box, and then "Link
tables at startup" in the Select An Example box.
<P>
This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for
Applications and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the
programming tools provided with Microsoft Access. For more information
about Visual Basic for Applications, please refer to your version of the
"Building Applications with Microsoft Access" manual.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
An application that uses split database design has its tables in one
database in a shared network location (the back-end database), and all its
queries, forms, reports, macros and modules in another database on each
client computer (the front-end database). The front-end database links all
of its tables to the back-end database. If the back-end database is moved,
errors occur in your application. You can build functionality into your
application to detect that the back-end database file is missing from its
expected location, and then prompt the user for the new location.
<P>
The following example demonstrates a method for relinking table data in
your application. This method creates a form that a user can open to relink
the back-end tables, and optionally uses a form to automatically verify the
back-end link behind the scenes.
<P>
This article assumes that you have the Microsoft Common Dialog control,
which is available with the Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition and
the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit version 7.0. If you do not have
this control, skip the Sub procedure cmdBrowse_Click() in the example.
<P>
NOTE: If you use the Common Dialog control and you plan to distribute your
database application, you must include the Common Dialog Control file,
Comdlg32.ocx, and its supporting DLLs with your setup files. For more
information about which supporting files to include with ActiveX controls
in Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition applications, search the Help
Index for "ActiveX controls, files required for." For more information
about which supporting files to include with OLE Custom Controls in
Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit version 7.0 applications, click the
Help button on the "Add the files that you want your custom Setup program
to copy" screen of the Setup Wizard.
