The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Apple Macintosh System Software, versions 7.0, 7.0.1, 7.1, 7.5, 7.5.1,

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This aritcle includes the following information:

<UL><LI>A brief history of file encoding
<LI>A list of encoding guidelines
<LI>A list of third-party manufacturers of encoding and decoding utilities
<P>
</UL><h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF ENCODING</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Uuencoding</h3>
 
<P>
This was historically the first method invented. The encoding was quite
simple and caused frequent problems. In particular, the first
implementation used the space character for encoding. But, some mail
gateways stripped spaces at the end of a line; so, what the recipient got
was invalid. Later, a special case was introduced to avoid this problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Xxencoding</h3>
 
<P>
This rarely used method appeared after the initial problems with
uuencoding, but before they were fixed. It avoids using the space character
by using a different character set for encoding.
<P>
<P><h3>Base64</h3>
 
<P>
This method was introduced for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)
standard, avoiding some rarely encountered problems with the other two
methods (which used some characters not available on some computers).
Together, with other benefits of MIME, this is the most secure method.
<P>
<P><h3>BinHex</h3>
 
<P>
A method conceived for transferring files among Macintosh systems. Files on
a Macintosh consist of two parts, the "data fork" and the "resource fork."
This encoding first adds a third header part, and composes the three parts
into a single data stream, which is then slightly compressed and encoded.
<P>
<P><h2>ENCODING GUIDELINES</h2>
 
<P>
When you work with file encoding, follow these guidelines:

<UL><LI>Avoid Xxencoding, which is obsolete.

<LI>You must use BinHex for Macintosh systems. It should not be used on
   other systems, because decoders are not widespread elsewhere.

<LI>If your mail software is MIME-compliant and offers to "attach" files
   encoded in Base64, use this method of encoding, as it is the preferred
   method for MIME messages. Otherwise, use uuencoding, which is still the
   most common encoding method.
<P>
   Notes:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - MIME-compliance is something only the mail software can handle. For
      example if you encode data to Base64 using UUDeview and then include
      the encoded data in your message, the resulting message will not be
      MIME-compliant.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - If your mail software does not allow "attachments" on its own and you
      have to use an external encoder, always use uuencoding.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Software is becoming more and more MIME-compliant which means that
      the uuencoding method will be replaced by Base64. However, as long as
      there is the possibility that the recipient uses older software,
      uuencoding is the safest method.
</PRE>
<LI>Compression is also an important issue. When possible, you should send a
   file compressed into a ZIP file or some similar format.
<P>
</UL><h2>THIRD-PARTY ENCODING AND DECODING UTILITIES</h2>
