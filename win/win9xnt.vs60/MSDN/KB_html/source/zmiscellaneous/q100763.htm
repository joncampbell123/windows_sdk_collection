6.00 6.20 6.22
MS-DOS

<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22
</UL> 
<P>
This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands
and filenames.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
You want to use DoubleSpace-compressed floppy disks without compressing
your hard disk, but when you run DBLSPACE, the initial setup screen does
not provide an option to compress only a floppy disk.
<P>
When you try to compress a floppy disk with DBLSPACE /COMPRESS &lt;drive:&gt;,
you receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   DoubleSpace cannot compress a floppy drive until you have installed
   DoubleSpace on your computer. To install DoubleSpace, type DBLSPACE
   at the command prompt.

</PRE>When you try to mount an already compressed floppy disk with
DBLSPACE /MOUNT &lt;drive:&gt;, you receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   There are no more drive letters reserved for DoubleSpace to use.
   To add more drive letters, choose the Options command from the
   Tools menu.

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To use DoubleSpace-compressed floppy disks without compressing the hard
disk, use one of the workarounds described below. Both procedures create a
DBLSPACE.INI file in the root directory of your startup drive and cause
DBLSPACE.BIN to remain in memory after startup. Note that the DBLSPACE.BIN
driver uses up to 54 kilobytes (K) of memory. You can not use compressed
floppy disks without loading DBLSPACE.BIN into memory. For more information
on DBLSPACE.BIN and memory, refer to your printed MS-DOS documentation and
online Help.
<P>
<P><h3>Workaround 1</h3>
 
<P>
Create a small, new DoubleSpace drive and then delete it. This creates the
DBLSPACE.INI file and loads DBLSPACE.BIN into memory so that you can read
the compressed floppy disk drive.
<P>
To do this:

<OL><P><LI>To run DoubleSpace, type "dblspace" (without the quotation marks)
    at the MS-DOS command prompt.

<P><LI>Choose Custom Setup.

<P><LI>Choose "Create a new empty compressed drive."

<P><LI>Select the drive you want to use. (DoubleSpace will use the free
    space on this drive to create a new compressed drive.)

<P><LI>When DoubleSpace displays the amount of free space to leave on
    the drive, use the UP ARROW key to move the highlight bar to the
    "Free space" setting and then press ENTER. This allows you to
    change the "Free space" setting.

<P><LI>When prompted for the amount of free space to leave on the drive,
    type a number LARGER than your hard disk drive and press ENTER.

<P><LI>After DoubleSpace tells you the maximum amount free space you can
    leave on your drive, type in that number. For example, if DoubleSpace
    tells you the maximum amount of free space is 95.55 megabytes (MB),
    leave 95 MB of free space.

<P><LI>Choose Continue.

<P><LI>Press the "C" key to create the compressed drive.

<P><LI>After DoubleSpace completes, if you do not want to keep the new
    compressed drive you created, run DBLSPACE and delete the new
    drive by selecting the Delete command from the Drive menu.
<P>
    Alternatively, you can delete the drive by using the following
    command:
<P>
       dblspace /delete &lt;drive:&gt;
<P>
    where &lt;drive:&gt; is the new compressed drive.
<P>
</OL>Now you can use compressed floppy disks. For example, to compress the
floppy disk in drive A:, type the following at the command prompt and
press ENTER:
<P>
<PRE>   dblspace /compress a:

</PRE></OL>To access an existing compressed floppy in drive A:, type the following
at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER:
<P>
<PRE>   dblspace /mount a:

</PRE><h3>Workaround 2</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a C:\DBLSPACE.INI file (where C is your startup disk) with a
   text editor such as MS-DOS Editor. The DBLSPACE.INI file should
   contain the following two lines:
<P>
<P><PRE>      MaxRemovableDrives=2
      LastDrive=F
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: LastDrive= must be set to one letter beyond your last
   logical drive letter. For example, if your last drive is E, use
   LastDrive=F in your DBLSPACE.INI file.

<P><LI>Copy DBLSPACE.BIN from your DOS directory to the root directory of
   your startup (boot) drive. For example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy c:\dos\dblspace.bin c:\
</PRE>
<P><LI>Restart your computer.
<P>
</OL>Now you can use compressed floppy disks. For example, to compress the
floppy disk in drive A:, type the following at the command prompt and
press ENTER:
<P>
<PRE>     dblspace /compress a:

</PRE></OL>To access an existing compressed floppy in drive A:, type the following
at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER:
<P>
<PRE>     dblspace /mount a:

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To remove the DBLSPACE driver from memory, delete the DBLSPACE.BIN file
from the root of your boot drive and then restart your computer. You can
use the DELTREE command to delete DBLSPACE.BIN:
<P>
<PRE>   deltree c:\dblspace.bin

</PRE>IMPORTANT: Once you delete DBLSPACE.BIN and restart your computer, you can
not create new compressed floppies or access existing compressed floppies.
