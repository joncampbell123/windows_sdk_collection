<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes several causes and cures for the LAN Manager
error: net 3226--Error in synchronizing with primary domain controller.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
While knowing that the problem stems from the primary domain controller
(PDC) narrows the problem somewhat, it still does not adequately cover
all possibilities. The first thing to do is translate the hexadecimal
"nnnn" of the number 0000:nnnn associated with the message. By way of
example, here is an explanation of a value for 'nnnn' taken from a recent
incident: C708.
<P>
First reverse the order of the two pairs of hexadecimal numbers:
<P>
C7-08 becomes 08C7
<P>
Next, translate this into decimal by multiplying the first position by
4096, the second position by 256, the third position by 16 and adding
all of these together along with the last position:
<P>
<PRE>0 * 4096 =    0
</PRE>8 *  256 = 2048
C *   16 =  192 (since C in hex is 12)
<PRE>7        =    7
           ____
           2247

</PRE>Now use this number in net helpmsg 2247 to produce:
<P>
<PRE>   NET2247: The UAS database file is corrupted

</PRE>This clarifies the problem and helps you determine what to do. If the
number computed is far out of range (valid values are approximately 1
to 5500) or seems inapplicable to the situation, go back and make sure
you transposed the pairs and performed the conversion correctly. For
instance, if C708 is converted without being transposed, the value is
50952.
<P>
Not all net 3226 messages are a result of the above problem. These causes
were extracted from incident reports to Product Support Services in the
last year.

<UL><LI>The day and time of the primary domain controller was more than 10
   minutes different than that of the backup domain controller or member
   server.

<LI>'Numbigbuf' was set too low, UAS replication uses this resource. The
   default should be adequate. Unfortunately, a documentation error
   suggests setting the value to 1 in LANMAN.INI if only HPFS is used.
   Remove this entry if you find it set this way.

<LI>The primary domain controller was paused.

<LI>Little or no free hard disk space was available.

<LI>'Sessions' had been set too low.

<LI>Tuning problems were causing time-outs.

<LI>A network card or repeater was bad.
<P>
</UL>Diagnostic and corrective actions may include:

<UL><LI>Make sure the PDC has accounts for all BDCs and members included in
   its Servers group.

<LI>Audit logons to see if failure to replicate is a result of the BDC or
   member not being able to logon to the PDC.

<LI>Run the CHKUAS program included in the Resource Toolkit to check for
   UAS errors.

<LI>Run the SYNCSTAT program (available from Microsoft Product Support
   Services) to get further information about synchronization status.

<LI>Synchronize the date/time of all servers.
<P>
<P>
</UL>At the problem server:
<P>
<PRE>   net stop netlogon
   net start netlogon /update:yes

</PRE><LI>Demote the problem server to stand lone and promote it again.
<P>
</UL>For more serious backup or member UAS corruption:

<OL><P><LI>Decompress NET.AC$ in the ACCOUNTS subdirectory on the OS/2 Server
   diskette by doing DECOMP A:\ACCOUNTS\NET.AC$ at the server.

<P><LI>Demote the problem server to standalone.

<P><LI>Shut down the problem server.

<P><LI>Boot it with the HPFS Recovery disk.

<P><LI>Rename NET.ACC, then rename NET.AC$ to NET.ACC--if it is in the
   &lt;lanman&gt;\ACCOUNTS directory.

<P><LI>Reboot the server.

<P><LI>Promote it to backup domain controller or member as appropriate.
<P>
</OL>For version 2.1a, a patched NETLOGON.EXE (available in CSD01.044) corrects
one cause of the net 3226 error.
