<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft takes several steps to ensure the software we ship is virus-free.
This article describes the product release and manufacturing/duplication
process. References to "media" include both floppy disks and CD-ROM disks.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Anti-Virus Tools</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft uses the latest virus detection and correction software available
in the industry. The virus detection software is updated when new viruses
are discovered.
<P>
<P><h3>Release Process</h3>
 
<P>
Each master disk or CD-ROM is created using newly formatted media. The
product groups uses both an approved standardized and quality enriched
process and set of optimized tools to create the master disk prior to
releasing the master disk to the product release organization.
<P>
The product release organization performs checks each master. The release
group also creates a master cross-verification checksum that accompanies
the master image once it has been approved. The checksum is a numeric
representation of the master as it was released. The checksum is used by
all duplication sites to cross-verify and ensure that the produced output
matches the released master. The checksum tool takes into account any
serialization requirements, verifying the integrity of the serial number,
and accounting for it in the numeric checksum value.
<P>
<P><h3>Product Release Verification And Product Group Approval</h3>
 
<P>
Several duplicate masters are sent to various groups within Microsoft for
verification and sign-off.
<P>
<P><h3>Release Insertion Into Manufacturing Network</h3>
 
<P>
The master is read into a UNIX-based disk duplication system. The system
creates an exact disk image of the master, duplicating the format and data.
A duplicated masters is created from the original read in image. This
silver master is used by the Product Group in their review, before they
sign-off. The silver master is not to be used in the Release to
Manufacturing (RTM) process. The golden master, delivered by the product
group to the release group, is the original image, and is released to
manufacturing when the final approvals are received from the product
groups.
<P>
<P><h3>Release To Manufacturing (RTM)</h3>
 
<P>
Once the masters are approved by all affected organizations, Microsoft
manufacturing is notified of the RTM by the Product Release organization.
The manufacturing groups that receive the masters access the release images
through a secured network.
<P>
<P><h3>Duplication Process</h3>
 
<P>
Disks are duplicated on a variety of industrial strength, quality focused
systems. Most of these systems are UNIX-based. The UNIX-based duplication
systems used in manufacturing are impervious to MS-DOS-based, Windows-
based, and Macintosh-based viruses.
<P>
The few MS-DOS-based and Windows-based standalone duplication systems do
not allow MS-DOS-based operating systems to access the duplication system.
Virus protection systems used by these MS-DOS-based and Windows-based
duplication systems strictly govern the duplication process, even when they
are not running.
<P>
<P><h3>In-Process Quality Check</h3>
 
<P>
Software products samples are checked using a checksum program on a
separate computer system. The checksum program verifies the data on the
finished media to ensure it matches the released master. This includes
verification of serialization requirements.
<P>
The floppy drive write circuitry is disabled on the test systems to ensure
the operating system and hardware cannot write any data to the floppy disk
being checked. This also applies to the Macintosh computer systems used for
in-process quality checks.
<P>
The software is then packaged in a disk baggy, bundled, and shipped. There
is no additional exposure to a computer in Manufacturing, Distribution, and
Logistics (MDL).
<P>
The personal computers used to check the duplication procedure are also
checked for viruses at least once each week.
<P>
<P><h3>Product Support Investigation</h3>
 
<P>
Product Support Services (PSS) can provide assistance in identifying a
virus. However, PSS cannot directly ascertain the source of a virus when
first contacted by the customer. Deductive reasoning and careful
troubleshooting can be used to assist the customer, however, only highly
sensitive media analysis and bit-by-bit media comparison equipment can
ascertain and analyze a suspected virus infected disk. This equipment can
identify the source of the virus, when it was transmitted to a disk, and by
what process. The analysis can provide assurance that a virus was
transmitted after the duplication process was completed. In this case, the
responsibility of the source of the virus does not reside in Microsoft
manufacturing and duplication.
<P>
<P><h3>Viruses On DMF</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: Do NOT use conventional virus scanning or repair utilities on
Distribution Media Format (DMF) disks. The DMF disk will be
absolutely unusable because the logical format of the DMF disk has
been altered back to a standard 1.44MB disk, and the file allocation
table (FAT) or master boot record (MBR) will now not allow access to
the data stored on the DMF disk. At this point, a replacement set of
disks will be required to continue.
