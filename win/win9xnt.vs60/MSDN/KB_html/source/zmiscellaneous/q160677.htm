The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Project for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Project "Save to Database" utility allows you to save and
open project information to and from a Microsoft Access database. One
component of this utility is the Proj2acc.dll file.
<P>
An updated Microsoft Project 4.0 to Microsoft Access database converter
(Proj2acc.dll) file is available in seven languages. The files are
available from the Microsoft Software Library. For information about
downloading these files, please see the "Instructions for Downloading"
section later in this article.
<P>
The database converter generates a Microsoft Access 2.0-format database,
which can also be used in later versions of Microsoft Access.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The new Proj2acc.dll file corrects the following issues:

<UL><LI>Any dates in the year 2000 are incorrect. For example, "4/15/2000" is
   changed to "4/15/100" instead of "4/15/00". When opening from the
   database, an error is generated that states that the date is invalid;
   the date is ignored.

<LI>Non-working day calendar changes may be incorrect. For example, if you
   use the D/M/Y date order and set 8/1/97 (August 1, 1997) as a non-
   working day, when opened from the database, January 8, 1997 is instead
   shown as a non-working day.

<LI>Percent complete values between one and nine percent are incorrect. For
   example, if you enter 3% on a task, when you save and open from the
   database, the value is 30%.

<LI>Erroneous dates may be produced if dates are at the beginning of the
   month. For example, if your project start date is set to 1/6/97 (again,
   assuming D/M/Y ordering), and you save to database, when opening the
   file, you may receive an error indicating invalid dates and the date is
   ignored. This error occurs in the French and German versions.

<LI>Setting the currency format to "0,00 $/h" causes the loss of resource
   rate information when opening from the database. For example, if you
   enter 5,50 $/h in the overtime rate of a resource and you save to the
   database, when you open from the database, you get a message indicating
   that the rate is invalid and your rate appears as 0,00 $/h.

<LI>The currency symbol placement setting is not respected after saving and
   opening from and to the database. For example, if you place the currency
   symbol such that your rates appear as "0.00 $/h" and you save to the
   database, when opened from the database your rates appear as "$0.00 /h".

   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

</PRE><h3>Instructions for Installing</h3>
 
<P>
After you obtain the file that matches your language version of Microsoft
Project, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the file to your Windows System directory or folder.
   For example, if you have the English version of Microsoft Project,
   copy the file Engprj2a.exe to your Windows System directory.
<P>
   NOTE: You cannot mix languages. For example, if you have the English
   version of Microsoft Project, you cannot use the Spanish version of
   the Save to Database file contained in Spnprj2a.exe.

<P><LI>Run the file you copied in step number 1. For example, in the Windows
   File manager, change to your Windows System directory, click the file
   name and, on the File menu, click run. Click OK.

<P><LI>You may get the message,
<P>
<P><PRE>      Warning! PROJ2ACC.DLL already exists. Overwrite (y/n)?
</PRE><P>
   Type "y" (without quotation marks) and click OK.

<P><LI>If you wish, you can delete the file copied in Step 1.
