The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.x, 7.x
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.x
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows NT, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Word may return the following error message when attempting to open a Rich
Text Format (RTF) file or an email message from Exchange Client using
WordMail:
<P>
<PRE>   There is not enough memory to complete the operation.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Word retains revisions for all open documents in memory using a global
revision table. A problem currently exists in rare instances where Word
writes the revision tables of more than one open document to a single
document when saving as RTF. If the revision table for that document grows
larger than the 64 kilobyte (KB) revision table maximum supported by the
RTF reader in Word, Word cannot reopen the file.
<P>
This problem can also occur when reading e-mail messages opened from
Exchange using WordMail because this transfer is also based on RTF.
<P>
This problem most commonly occurs when running Word in a network
environment where a large number of documents may be open at one time.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Word</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: The following workaround addresses the problem described above, but
the tradeoff is that the history of revisions made to the document is lost.
<P>
Method 1: Use a WordBasic Macro to Trim the Revision Table
<P>
The following macro trims the revision table in the RTF document.

   Conversions check box.

</OL><h3>WordMail</h3>
 
<P>
Turn off WordMail and read the message in Exchange. To do this, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start the Exchange mail client.

<P><LI>On the Compose menu, click WordMail Options.

<P><LI>Click to clear the Enable Word as a Mail Editor check box and click
   Close.

<P><LI>Open the mail message in Exchange.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Disabling WordMail as the message editor allows you to open the
message because Exchange does not recognize (or write) the revision table.
Exchange ignores the revision table and successfully opens the message.
<P>
To help prevent others who are using WordMail from receiving a message that
has accumulated a large revision table, quit Word and Log Off from Exchange
at least once a day.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Word 97 for Windows and Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The revision table in an RTF file header can be viewed by Turning on the
Confirm Conversions option, open an RTF file as Text Only, and searching
for the string "\revtbl" to identify the starting point of the revision
table. If a revision table contains names of authors who never actually
edited the document, then the above problem has occurred.
