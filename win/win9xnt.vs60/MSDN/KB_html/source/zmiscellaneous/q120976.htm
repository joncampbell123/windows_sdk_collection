<P>
OVERVIEW
 
<P>
This Application Note includes two Ami Pro version 3.0 text converters
that convert Ami Pro 3.0 files to and from Microsoft Word version 6.0
for Windows, Microsoft Word version 6.0 for Windows NT, or Microsoft
Word version 7.0 for Windows 95. Ami_pro.cnv is for use with Word for
Windows, and Ami332.cnv is for use with Word for Windows NT and Word
for Windows 95.
<P>
Also included is Amilimit.doc, a Word 6.0 document that contains a
table of conversion-limitation information about the Ami Pro
converters. The table lists only the features that are not converted,
that are not supported in one product or the other, or that require
comment.
<P>
NOTE: After you install a new converter, you must convert at least one file
from the "foreign" file format (that is, the format for which the converter
was designed--in this case, you must open at least one Ami Pro file).
Opening a foreign file causes Word to rebuild the list from which it
selects the converter. The converter will not be available until you do
this.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>INSTALLATION AND CONVERSION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h2>WORD VERSION 6.0 FOR WINDOWS</h2>
 
<P>
To use the converter with Word for Windows, first copy the converter
file to your Word program folder (usually, C:\Winword), quit and
restart Word, and then open an Ami Pro file.
<P>
<P><h3>To copy Ami_pro.cnv to your Word for Windows program folder</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>If you received a disk with this Application Note, insert the disk
   in the appropriate floppy disk drive.
<P>
   If you downloaded this Application Note from an online service,
   skip to step 2. This procedure assumes that you have already
   downloaded and extracted the compressed file.

<P><LI>From the Main group in Windows Program Manager, choose the MS-DOS
   Prompt icon. When the MS-DOS prompt appears, type the following and
   press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;source&gt;:\ami_pro.cnv &lt;WinWord&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;source&gt; is either the letter of your floppy disk drive or
   the path to the folder containing the file you downloaded and
   extracted from online services, and &lt;WinWord&gt; is the path to your
   Word for Windows program folder (usually, C:\Winword). For example,
   if you are installing from a floppy disk that you inserted in drive
   A, and C:\Winword is the path to your Word for Windows program
   folder, type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\ami_pro.cnv c:\winword
</PRE><P>
   Or, for example, if you downloaded Gc1064.exe from online services
   to C:\Download and C:\Ww is the path to your Word for Windows
   program folder, type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy c:\download\ami_pro.cnv c:\ww
