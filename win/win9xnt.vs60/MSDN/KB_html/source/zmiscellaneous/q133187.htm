<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to install a point-to-point protocol in Windows
95. You can use a point-to-point protocol to connect to PPP servers such as
Windows 95 servers, Windows NT servers, Novell NetWare servers, Shiva
LanRover servers, and Internet service providers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Before you can use the following steps, you must know the phone number for
the computer you want to connect to, the server name (if needed), and the
TCP/IP configuration (if needed).

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.

<P><LI>On the Windows Setup tab, double-click Communications in the Components
   box. Click the Dial-Up Networking check box to select it (if there is
   not already a check mark in the box), and then click OK. Click OK to
   install the Dial-Up Networking components.

<P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, then
   click Dial-Up Networking.

<P><LI>Double-click Make New Connection. Note that if you do not have a modem
   installed, you are prompted to install one.

<P><LI>Proceed through the Make New Connection Wizard to create a connectoid
   for the new connection.

<P><LI>Double-click the new connectoid in the Dial-Up Networking folder to
   open the new connection.
<P>
</OL>If you are connecting to a Windows NT dial-up server, make sure to type a
valid user name and password when you start the connection.
<P>
If you connect to many different servers, you may want to configure the
connectoid to open a Terminal window after dialing so that you can enter
your logon information after the connection is made. To do so, use the
right mouse button to click the connectoid, click Properties on the menu
that appears, then click Configure. On the Options tab, click the "Bring up
Terminal window after dialing" check box, then click OK. Use the Terminal
window to enter any required logon information.
<P>
If the modem dials but no connection is established, check the following
items:

<UL><LI>Make sure you chose the correct server type.

<LI>Make sure that compatible protocols are installed for the dial-up
   adapter.

<LI>Try turning off software compression. To do so, use the right mouse
   button to click the connectoid, then click Properties on the menu that
   appears. Click Configure, click the Connection tab, then click
   Advanced.

<LI>Open the Terminal window after dialing to determine whether
   additional logon information is required.
<P>
</UL>If you still cannot establish a connection, check with your system
administrator or Internet provider to determine the required settings for
your protocols, logon information, and TCP/IP addressing.
