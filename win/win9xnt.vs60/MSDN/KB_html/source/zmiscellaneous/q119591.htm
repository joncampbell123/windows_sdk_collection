<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article tells you how to obtain Microsoft drivers, patches,
Application Notes, and other support files by downloading them from various
online information services. This article contains information on the
following topics:
<P>
<PRE>   General Instructions for Downloading
      MS-DOS or Windows-Based Files (.exe)
      Macintosh-Based Files (.hqx or .sea)

   Specific Instructions for Online Information Services
      World Wide Web (WWW) on the Internet
      Microsoft Anonymous ftp Server on the Internet
      Microsoft Download Service (MSDL)

</PRE><h2>GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOWNLOADING</h2>
 
<P>
The files Microsoft posts on online services are usually compressed, self-
extracting files.
<P>
NOTE: Small files may not be compressed. These files will appear with their
original extensions and are not self-extracting.
<P>
<P><h3>MS-DOS or Windows-Based Files (.exe)</h3>
 
<P>
If a compressed, self-extracting file is MS-DOS based or Windows based, it
has an .exe extension. These files were compressed using IExpress or the
PKWare file-compression utility. To correctly download and extract an .exe
file, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Locate the file you want to download using one of the methods described
   in the sections in the "Specific Instructions for Online Information
   Services" section of this article.

<P><LI>If you are downloading to a floppy disk, you need a formatted, blank
   disk. If you are downloading to your hard disk, create a new folder in
   which you can temporarily place the file and extract it.
<P>
   CAUTION: Do not download files directly into your Windows folder. Doing
   so could overwrite files essential to the proper operation of your
   system.

<P><LI>Follow the downloading procedure used by your service to retrieve the
   file you identified in step 1. Download it to a floppy disk or to a new
   folder.

<P><LI>To extract the contents of the self-extracting .exe file after you
   download it, type the following from the command prompt or the Run
   command
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;path\filename&gt; -d
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;path\filename&gt; is the location and name of the downloaded file.
   For example, if you downloaded Sample.exe to C:\Download, type the
   following at the Run command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\download\sample -d
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: Although you can double-click a self-extracting .exe file to
   extract its contents, this step provides a method that ensures a
   recursively compressed file will maintain its file structure.
<P>
</OL>If you have problems extracting downloaded files, try downloading them
again.
<P>
<P><h3>Macintosh-Based Files (.hqx or .sea)</h3>
 
<P>
If a file is Macintosh based, it has an .hqx extension (except on MSDL,
where some files have .sea extensions). An .hqx file is a BinHex 4.0, text-
formatted file. After you download the .hqx file and copy it to your
Macintosh, decode it with BinHex 4.0 (or another utility that understands
BinHex 4 format, such as Stuffit or CompactPro). Decoding converts the .hqx
file into a binary-formatted, compressed .sea file. To extract the contents
of the file, double-click the &lt;Filename&gt;.sea icon.
<P>
<P><h2>SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR ONLINE INFORMATION SERVICES</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Downloading a File from the World Wide Web (WWW) on the Internet</h3>
 
<P>
To download a file from the World Wide Web, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Connect to Support Online at the following address:
<P>
<P><PRE>      <B><A href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/default.asp">http://support.microsoft.com/support/default.asp</A></B>
</PRE>
<P><LI>If you know the name of the file you want to download, select your
   product, type the file name in the "I want to search for" box, and then
   click Find.
<P>
</OL>If you don't know the file name, follow these steps to find and download
the file:

<OL><P><LI>On the menu bar on the left, click Downloads.
<P>
   If you do not see Downloads, click Show Long Menu to expand the menu.

<P><LI>On the Downloads page, click the product area in which you are
   interested.

<P><LI>Some product areas have additional categories. If the product area
   you selected has more categories, select the category in which you
   are interested.

<P><LI>The file names and the corresponding descriptions are displayed.
   Click the desired file.

<P><LI>If your Browser asks you if you want to save the file, click the
   save option. Select the destination folder (the floppy disk drive or
   the folder to which you want to download the file) and click Save.
<P>
</OL><h3>Microsoft Anonymous ftp Server on the Internet</h3>
 
<P>
If you are connecting using an Internet Browser:

<OL><P><LI>In the address area of your Internet browser, type the following and
   press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ftp.microsoft.com
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click the Softlib link and then click the MSlFiles link.

<P><LI>Scroll through the list of files to locate file you want to download.
<P>
   Note that the files are listed in alphabetical order.

<P><LI>Click the file name link &lt;FILENAME.EXT&gt; to download the file.
<P>
</OL>If you are connecting using the MS-DOS prompt:

<OL><P><LI>Type the following at the "&gt;" prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ftp ftp.microsoft.com
</PRE>
<P><LI>When prompted for a user name and password, type "Anonymous" (without
   the quotation marks). Use your email address for the password.

<P><LI>Change to the Softlib/Mslfiles folder. To download a file, type the
   following at the "&gt;" prompt
<P>
<P><PRE>      Get &lt;FILENAME.EXT&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;FILENAME.EXT&gt; is the name of the file you want to download.

<P><LI>Type BYE to exit ftp.
<P>
</OL><h3>Microsoft Download Service (MSDL)</h3>
 
<P>
Using your modem, dial-up (425) 936-6735. This service is available from 1
AM to midnight, 7 days a week. The highest download speed available is
14,400 bits per second (bps). For complete information about using the
MSDL, obtain the Application Note GA0604, "Microsoft Download Service
(MSDL) Instructions" from online services, or see the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base article:
