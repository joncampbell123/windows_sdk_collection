<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article summarizes corrections made to the WordPerfect converter
in Word for Windows version 6.0c, which converts between Word and
WordPerfect 5.0 and 5.1 for MS-DOS and WordPerfect 5.1 and 5.2 for
Windows file formats.
<P>
All corrections listed here have been made since the immediately previous
Word 6.0a product release. For a list of enhancements made in the Word 6.0
and 6.0a releases, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../zzmiscellaneous/q105316.htm">Q105316</A></B>
   TITLE     : WordPerfect 5.x Converter Enhancements in Word for Windows
               6.0

</PRE><h2>CORRECTED PROBLEMS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>"Not Enough Memory to Complete Operation" / GPF Generated by Nested Formats</h3>
 
<P>
The above errors are no longer received when you import a WordPerfect
document in which a box code (Figure, User, Text, Table, or Equation)
exists between starting and ending mark codes. Mark codes are used to
delimit the beginning and ending locations of table of contents, table of
authorities, list, and index entries in WordPerfect. A code sequence that
generates this problem in Word 6.0a might appear in WordPerfect Reveal
Codes similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   [Mark:ToC,1]...[Fig Box:1;test.wpg;]...[End Mark:ToC,1]

</PRE><h3>Multiple Pictures Overlap in Same Position</h3>
 
<P>
When you open a WordPerfect document in which box code 145 has been used to
delimit an embedded graphic image, multiple pictures no longer overlap in a
single location and pictures delimited by this code are no longer lost. Box
code 145 is vaguely defined as "reserved" in the WordPerfect binary file
format and is not recognized by the earlier WordPerfect converter. This
code is used infrequently and is invisible to the WordPerfect user.
<P>
<P><h3>Contents of Expanded Master Document Lost</h3>
 
<P>
When you open a WordPerfect master document that has been expanded
(contains the latest results of supporting subdocuments), content
originating from the subdocuments is no longer lost.
<P>
<P><h3>Cannot Specify Path to Missing Subdocuments</h3>
 
<P>
When you open a WordPerfect master document for which supporting
subdocuments are not available in the original directory locations
specified in the master document, you can now specify the current locations
of the secondary files. In Word 6.0a, Word provides an alert regarding the
absence of these files but provides only the options to cancel conversion
or continue conversion with loss of subdocument content.
<P>
<P><h3>Horizontal Box Position Incorrect If Gutter Margin Active</h3>
 
<P>
When you open a WordPerfect document, Text, Figure, User, Equation, and
Table boxes are no longer misaligned horizontally if a gutter margin is
present. In Word 6.0a, converted boxes are aligned horizontally relative to
page, and the gutter margin is ignored in relation to placement of the
converted box. This results in boxes appearing too far left or right by the
amount of the gutter margin value.
<P>
<P><h3>Paragraph Number Cross References Lost</h3>
 
<P>
Cross-references to paragraph numbers are now retained as REF \N fields in
Word. In Word 6.0a, the last generated result of each paragraph number
cross-reference is retained as normal text only and cannot be updated
following conversion.
<P>
<P><h3>Page Size Change Not Correctly Retained</h3>
 
<P>
When you open a WordPerfect document in which page-size or orientation
changes exist, incorrect page sizes are no longer applied at locations of
these changes.
<P>
For example, when Word 6.0a encounters a WordPerfect page orientation that
changed from portrait to landscape, Word correctly sets the orientation
to landscape, but Word leaves the page size set to portrait values (for
example, 8.5-inch width by 11-inch height). The visual result is that pages
of a document originally formatted as landscape display and print in
portrait orientation in Word. The inverse of this scenario (portrait
incorrectly appearing as landscape) is also possible.
<P>
<P><h3>Leading Paragraph Number Lost in Multilevel Numbered Paragraphs</h3>
 
<P>
When you open a WordPerfect document containing paragraph numbering,
leading numbers are no longer lost from numbered paragraphs. For example,
three paragraphs numbered as
<P>
<PRE>   1.
   1.1
   1.1.1

</PRE>in Word 6.0a appear following conversion incorrectly numbered as:
<P>
<PRE>   1.
    .1
      .1

</PRE>This problem no longer occurs.
<P>
<P><h3>Symbol Characters Appear at Beginning of Document</h3>
 
<P>
Font properties are now correctly set for the PRIVATE field that appears at
the beginning of all converted WordPerfect documents.
<P>
In Word 6.0a, in some instances the content of the PRIVATE field is
formatted as Symbol font. If the option to view hidden text is active,
Symbol font characters appear in place of the word PRIVATE.
<P>
<P><h3>Endnote Number Converted Incorrectly / Endnote Text Cannot be Edited</h3>
 
<P>
In Word, when you open a WordPerfect document that contains endnotes, the
first endnote number is now correctly retained, and the first 10 characters
of the first endnote entry can be edited. In Word 6.0a, the first endnote
number in the endnote pane appears incorrectly, and the first 10 characters
of the endnote cannot be selected, deleted, or otherwise edited.
<P>
<P><h3>Endnote Reference and Endnote Text Styles Not Applied</h3>
 
<P>
In Word, when you open a WordPerfect document containing endnotes, the
Endnote Reference style is now correctly applied to the endnote number in
the document body and in the endnote pane. The Endnote Text style is also
correctly applied to the endnote text. In Word 6.0a, neither style is
applied, resulting in incorrect appearance.
<P>
<P><h3>Boxes in Footers Incorrectly Positioned at Top of Page</h3>
 
<P>
When you open a WordPerfect document in Word that contains a Figure, User,
Text, Table, or Equation box within a footer that is positioned at top
relative to page, the box is now correctly positioned at the top of the
footer.
<P>
In WordPerfect, a position of top relative to page for a box within a
footer really means top relative to footer. In Word 6.0a such boxes were
incorrectly positioned at top of page.
<P>
<P><h3>Word Hangs If INPUT Code Without Associated Closing Tilde Encountered</h3>
 
<P>
In Word when you open a WordPerfect document containing a [Mrg:INPUT] merge
code without the associated tilde character (~), a FILLIN field with no
prompt message is now generated. In Word 6.0a, Word stops responding.
<P>
In WordPerfect, a [Mrg:INPUT] code is normally followed by message text and
a tilde character acting as the message terminator. If the message text
or tilde character is manually removed from a document for one or more
[Mrg:INPUT] fields prior to conversion, earlier versions of Word stop
responding.
<P>
<P><h3>Page Break Lost If Format Property Change Exists Within Header or Footer</h3>
 
<P>
In Word, when you open a WordPerfect document that contains hard page
breaks preceded by header or footer definitions that contain formatting
codes, the hard page breaks are no longer lost. In Word 6.0a, if a header
or footer definition preceding a hard page break contains formatting codes
such as a page numbering style change, the subsequent hard page break is
sometimes ignored.
<P>
<P><h3>Legal Style Heading Numbering Exports as Outline Paragraph Numbering</h3>
 
<P>
Legal heading numbering is now exported as normal text with heading styles
applied when you save in WordPerfect format. This retains the appearance of
legal numbering. In Word 6.0a, legal heading numbering is exported to
WordPerfect format as paragraph numbering with a paragraph numbering
definition specifying Outline style. This functionality compromises legal
appearance. Current functionality is the best compromise possible given
paragraph numbering model differences in the two products.
<P>
<P><h3>TOC Levels Not Retained \ TOC Indentation Compromised Following Update</h3>
 
<P>
In Word, when you open a WordPerfect document containing table of contents
entries with levels other than level 1, the appropriate level is now
preserved through use of the \L switch in the resulting TC fields in Word.
In Word 6.0a, all marked TOC entries are converted as level 1 entries.
Therefore, although a converted TOC might appear correctly immediately
following conversion, all indentation within the TOC is lost if the TOC is
subsequently updated in Word.
<P>
<P><h3>Page Numbers for TOC Entries Incorrectly Suppressed</h3>
 
<P>
When you open a WordPerfect document containing a table of contents in
Word, page numbers for all TOC entries are now correctly retained. In Word
6.0a, in isolated instances the TC field \N switch, which suppresses the
page number for a TOC entry, is inappropriately emitted, resulting in page
numbers not appearing for one or more levels of a converted table of
contents.
<P>
"No sequence specified" or "No table of figures entries found" During
Update of Converted Lists
 
<P>
In Word 6.0c, when you open a WordPerfect document containing a simple list
(WordPerfect List options 1 through 5), you can now update the resulting
table of contents successfully. In Word 6.0a, the converter incorrectly
assumes any list it encounters is a list of Figure, Table, Text Box, User
Box, or Equation captions (WordPerfect List options 6 through 10). When the
resulting TOC is subsequently updated in Word, one of the above messages is
received, given the absence of these captions.
<P>
<P><h3>Numbers Skipped in Paragraph Numbering Sequence</h3>
 
<P>
In Word 6.0c, when you open a WordPerfect document containing a series of
numbered paragraphs, numbers are no longer skipped in the resulting heading
number sequence when a change in the text preceding a paragraph numbering
code is encountered. In Word 6.0a, a numbering sequence appearing as
<P>
<PRE>   Section 101
   Sec. 102
   Sec. 103

</PRE>appears incorrectly following conversion as:
<P>
<PRE>   101
   103
   104

</PRE>This occurs because the converter attempts to convert changes in text
strings preceding WordPerfect paragraph number definitions to the "text
before" values for heading numbering in Word.
<P>
NOTE: By design, text preceding WordPerfect paragraph numbers is lost in
Word when a WordPerfect document is converted to heading numbering because
of differences between Word heading numbering and WordPerfect paragraph
numbering models.
<P>
Flush Right Emulation Incorrect in Headers, Footers, Footnotes, Endnotes,
and Boxes
 
<P>
When you open a WordPerfect document containing flush-right line format
within a header, footer, footnote, endnote, or any type of WordPerfect box,
the right-aligned tab stop emitted to emulate the flush-right format now
appears at the correct horizontal position. In Word 6.0a, the tab-stop is
sometimes positioned inaccurately.
<P>
<P><h3>"Unable to load equation converter, continue?"</h3>
 
<P>
When you save a Word document as WordPerfect format, the above error is no
longer received unless the equation converter has not been correctly
installed. In Word 6.0a, the converter looks for the equation converter
dynamic link library (DLL) Wpft5.equ in the wrong location in some
instances, resulting in this error.
<P>
<P><h3>Label Page Size Definitions on Every Page Generate GPF in Word</h3>
 
<P>
When you open a WordPerfect document containing page size definitions that
themselves contain label definitions, you will no longer receive a general
protection (GP) fault. Label definitions are converted to tables in Word.
In Word 6.0a, if you encounter page size definitions on two or more
consecutive pages in a WordPerfect document, the converter attempts to
create an invalid Word document, and a GP fault subsequently occurs.
<P>
<P><h3>Various Indentation Problems</h3>
 
<P>
A variety of indentation problems have been corrected. Areas of improvement
include:

<UL><LI>Preservation of hanging indents within numbered and other paragraphs
<LI>Preservation of indentation during round-trip to and from WordPerfect
<LI>Indentation of page numbers within imported tables of contents
<P>
</UL><h3>Font / Font Size Import</h3>
 
<P>
Minor optimization has been made to the import of fonts and font sizes.
<P>
<P><h3>Character Mapping Import / Export Problems</h3>
 
<P>
In Word 6.0a, ANSI characters 139, 173, and 175 are not mapped optimally in
round-trip conversion to and from WordPerfect. These characters now
correctly retained.
<P>
In Word 6.0a, ANSI characters 135, 145, 148, 151, 164, 165, and 223 are
exported incorrectly when you save as WordPerfect format. These characters
are now mapped to their appropriate WordPerfect character equivalents.
<P>
<P><h3>Handling of Invalid WordPerfect Documents</h3>
 
<P>
It is common for documents exported in WordPerfect format by other
third-party applications (for example, WordPerfect for the Macintosh) to
contain technically invalid information. The most common problem Microsoft
encounters is the existence of corrupted style packet definitions.
<P>
In some cases, such documents can be verified as invalid by observing
behavior in WordPerfect. In many cases however, the problem is transparent
to the WordPerfect user prior to attempting to open these documents into
Word. When such documents are opened in Word, you may receive one or more
of the following error messages, possibly followed by a GP fault:
<P>
<PRE>   "Not enough memory to complete operation"

   "Cannot open file."

   "This document appears to be corrupt, continue?"

   "This is not a valid style name"

</PRE>For known causes of these errors that can consistently be avoided (for
example, invalid style packets generated when exporting to WordPerfect
5.0/5.1 format from WordPerfect for the Macintosh), the converter now
works around the invalid data and successfully converts the document.
<P>
NOTE: The above error messages do not represent a problem in the
converter. You should receive these error messages when converting
WordPerfect documents that are damaged in any way.
