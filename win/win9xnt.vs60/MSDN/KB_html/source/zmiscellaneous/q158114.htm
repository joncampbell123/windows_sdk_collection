The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 98
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to use Phone Dialer, HyperTerminal, or another 32-bit
communications program in Windows 95, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Another program is using the selected Telephony device. Try again after
   the other program completes.

</PRE>This error message may be displayed even if no other communications
program is currently using the modem you are attempting to use.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can be caused by any of the following situations:

<UL><LI>If you are using an internal modem, the resources that the modem is
   configured to use may not match the resource settings for the serial
   port that the modem is configured to use in Device Manager.
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, Windows 95 is able to determine which
   resources the modem is using and configure the serial port accordingly.
   However, if a resource conflict exists between the modem or the serial
   port that the modem is configured to use and another device installed
   on your computer, Windows 95 may be unable to determine which resources
   the modem is using. In addition, this problem can occur if the resource
   settings for the serial port are modified manually after Windows 95
   configures the port, but the modem is not configured to use the same
   resources.

<LI>The Unimodem.vxd file is missing or damaged.

<LI>There is another communication program currently running on the
   computer.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use the appropriate method:

<UL><LI>Verify that the resources the modem is configured to use match the
   resource settings for the serial port that the modem is configured to
   use in Device Manager. For information about how to determine which
   resources the modem is configured to use, consult the documentation
   included with the modem, or contact the modem's manufacturer. To
   determine the resource settings for the serial port that the modem is
   configured to use, follow these steps:
<P>
   1. In Control Panel, double-click System.
<P>
   2. Click the Device Manager tab, and then double-click the Ports
<P><PRE>      (COM &amp; LPT) branch to expand it.
</PRE><P>
   3. Click the serial (communications) port the modem is configured to
<P><PRE>      use, click Properties, and then click the Resources tab.
</PRE><P>
   To determine which serial port the modem is configured to use, click
   the modem in Device Manager, click Properties, and then click the Modem
   tab.
<P>
   If the resources that the modem is configured to use do not match the
   resource settings for the serial port, physically configure the modem
   to use different resources or modify the resource settings for the
   serial port in Device Manager. For information about how to configure
   the modem, consult the documentation included with the modem, or
   contact the modem's manufacturer.
<P>
   If you are unable to resolve the problem by physically configuring the
   modem to use different resources or by modifying the resource settings
   for the serial port in Device Manager, please see the following article
   in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : How to Install an Internal Modem in Windows 95

</PRE><LI>Verify that the Unimodem.vxd file in the Windows\System folder is not
   missing or damaged. To do so, rename the file (if it exists), and then
   extract a new copy of the file from your original Windows 95 disks or
   CD-ROM. The Unimodem.vxd file is located in the Win95_03.cab cabinet
   file on the Windows 95 CD-ROM or disk 3.
<P>
   For information about using the Extract tool, type "extract" (without
   quotation marks) at a command prompt, or see the following article in
   the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE><LI>Quit any running communication programs. To verify there are no
   communication programs running on the computer, follow these steps:
<P>
   1. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE to open the Close Program dialog box.
<P>
   2. Close all communication programs. To close a program, click the
<P><PRE>      program, and then click End Task.
</PRE><P>
   3. Repeat steps 1-2 until all unnecessary programs have been closed.
