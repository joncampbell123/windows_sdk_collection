<P>
<P><h3>Determining If Windows 95 Supports Your CD-ROM Drive in Protected Mode</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 does not include protected-mode drivers for specific CD-ROM
drives. Instead, Windows 95 provides protected-mode access to CD-ROM
drives by including protected-mode drivers for the SCSI, IDE, and
proprietary controllers that CD-ROM drives are connected to. The CD-ROM
controller may be built into the motherboard, a separate controller, or a
sound card. If Windows 95 includes a protected-mode driver for the device
that your CD-ROM drive is connected to, your CD-ROM drive is most likely
supported in protected mode.
<P>
Windows 95 includes protected-mode drivers for proprietary CD-ROM
controllers from the following manufacturers:

<UL><LI>Mitsumi
<LI>Panasonic (MKEPanasonic)
<LI>Sony
<P>
</UL>In addition, Windows 95 includes protected-mode drivers for many sound
cards and SCSI and IDE controllers. To determine if Windows 95 includes a
protected-mode driver for the sound card or SCSI or IDE controller that
your CD-ROM drive is connected to, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click Add New Hardware.

<P><LI>Click Next, click No, and then click Next.

<P><LI>Click the type of device that your CD-ROM drive is connected to in the
   Hardware Types box, and then click Next.
<P>
   If your CD-ROM drive is connected to a sound card, you need to
   determine what type of CD-ROM controller is built into the sound card.
   It will be a SCSI controller, an IDE controller, or a proprietary
   CD-ROM controller. To determine the type of CD-ROM controller built
   into the sound card, consult the sound card's documentation or
   manufacturer. Note that the manufacturer of the sound card may not be
   the same as the manufacturer of the controller built into the sound
   card.
<P>
   If the CD-ROM drive is connected to a SCSI controller, click SCSI
   Controllers in the Hardware Types box. If the CD-ROM drive is connected
   to an IDE controller, click Hard Disk Controllers in the Hardware Types
   box. If the CD-ROM drive is connected to a proprietary CD-ROM
   controller, click CD-ROM Controllers in the Hardware Types box.

<P><LI>Click the manufacturer of the device that your CD-ROM drive is
   connected to in the Manufacturers box. If the specific device that the
   drive is connected to appears in the Models box, Windows 95 includes a
   protected-mode driver for the device and the CD-ROM drive is most
   likely supported in protected mode.
<P>
   If the manufacturer of the device does not appear in the Manufacturers
   box or the specific device does not appear in the Models box,
   Windows 95 does not include a protected-mode driver for the device and
   the CD-ROM drive is not supported in protected mode.
<P>
</OL>For information about specific CD-ROM drives that require real-mode
drivers to either work in Windows 95 or be detected by Windows 95, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : CD-ROM Drives Requiring Real-Mode Drivers

</PRE></OL><h3>Obtaining Protected-Mode CD-ROM Drivers from Other Sources</h3>
 
<P>
If Windows 95 does not include a protected-mode driver for the SCSI, IDE,
or proprietary CD-ROM controller that your CD-ROM drive is connected to,
contact the manufacturer of the device to inquire whether a protected-mode
driver that is compatible with Windows 95 is available. If no protected-
mode driver is available, real-mode drivers must be used.
<P>
<P><h3>Alternatives to Protected-Mode CD-ROM Drive Support</h3>
 
<P>
When you are using real-mode drivers for your CD-ROM drive, the Performance
tab in the System Properties dialog box shows that your CD-ROM drive is
using MS-DOS Compatibility mode. To prevent this message from being
displayed, you must use protected-mode drivers for the CD-ROM drive.
<P>
If your CD-ROM configuration is not supported by the protected-mode
drivers included with Windows 95, you should be able to use the real-mode
drivers included with the CD-ROM drive to provide real-mode access to the
drive in Windows 95. Note that Windows 95 does not include real-mode
CD-ROM drivers. If you must use real-mode drivers for your CD-ROM drive,
use the CD-ROM driver included with the drive. For information about how
to obtain, install, or configure the real-mode CD-ROM driver, consult the
documentation included with the drive, or contact the drive's manufacturer.
<P>
If you do not know the correct syntax to load the real-mode CD-ROM driver,
there may be a file named Config.dos in the root folder of the boot drive
that contains the correct syntax. If the driver is not installed on the
computer, you must reinstall it. For information about how to do so,
consult the CD-ROM drive's documentation or manufacturer.
<P>
Notes:

<UL><LI>If you need to use real-mode CD-ROM drivers, make sure that the
   Mscdex.exe line in the Autoexec.bat file points to the Mscdex.exe file
   in the Windows\Command folder. If your CD-ROM drive uses a third-party
   version of the CD-ROM extensions, change that line in the Autoexec.bat
   file to point to the Mscdex.exe file in the Windows\Command folder.

<LI>If your CD-ROM drive is connected to an IDE or SCSI controller and you
   determine that real-mode CD-ROM drivers must be used, you must also use
   real-mode drivers for the controller and any other devices on that IDE
   channel or SCSI chain. Using real-mode drivers for an IDE, SCSI, or
   proprietary CD-ROM controller built into a sound card does not require
   the use of real-mode drivers for the sound card itself.
<P>
</UL><h3>Loading Real-Mode Drivers in Addition to Protected-Mode Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
In most cases, you do not need to load real-mode drivers in addition to
the protected-mode drivers. For information about CD-ROM drives that are
supported in protected mode, but require real-mode drivers to either work
in Windows 95 or be detected by Windows 95, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win95x/q131499.htm">Q131499</A></B>
   TITLE     : CD-ROM Drives Requiring Real-Mode Drivers

</PRE>NOTE: Even if real-mode drivers are not necessary for accessing the CD-ROM
drive in Windows 95, they are necessary for accessing the drive when you
boot to a Windows 95 command prompt or you restart the computer in MS-DOS
mode. Therefore, you may want to disable (instead of remove) the real-mode
CD-ROM driver in the Config.sys file and Mscdex.exe in the Autoexec.bat
file, and keep a copy of the real-mode CD-ROM driver on the hard disk.
