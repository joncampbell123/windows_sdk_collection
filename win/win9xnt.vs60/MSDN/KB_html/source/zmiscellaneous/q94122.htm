HP DeskJet Family Version A.03.10 for Windows 3.0
(DESKJET.DRV)
 
<P>
<PRE>   Models:      DeskJet, DeskJet Plus, DeskJet 500
   Fonts:       Internal, cartridges, download fonts
   Problem:     Does not support scalable or TrueType fonts
   Recommend:   See "Additional Notes" below

</PRE>HP DeskJet 500 Scalable Version 1.0 for Windows 3.0
(DJ500.DRV)
 
<P>
<PRE>   Models:      DeskJet, DeskJet Plus, DeskJet 500
   Fonts:       Internal, cartridges, scalable fonts
   Problem:     Does not support TrueType fonts
   Recommend:   See "Additional Notes" below

</PRE>HP DeskJet Series Version 2.0 for Windows 3.0
(DJ500C.DRV)
 
<P>
<PRE>   Models:      DeskJet, DeskJet Plus, DeskJet 500, and 500 Color
   Fonts:       Internal, cartridges, scalable, and TrueType
   Problem:     See "HP DeskJet Series Version 2.1" below.
   Recommend:   See "Additional Notes" below.

</PRE>HP DeskJet Series Version 2.1 for Windows 3.0
(DJ500C.DRV)
 
<P>
<PRE>   Models:      DeskJet, DeskJet Plus, DeskJet 500, 500C
   Fonts:       Internal, cartridges, scalable, and TrueType
   Problem 1:   TrueType fonts print as black blocks
   Recommend:   Update to Windows version 3.1 Universal Printer
                Driver (UNIDRV.DLL)
   Problem 2:   Prints nothing but ink smear with HP DeskJet, Plus,
                and 500 models
   Recommend:   Update to Windows version 3.1 Universal Printer
                Driver (UNIDRV.DLL)

   Notes on versions 2.0 and 2.1: The HP DeskJet Series drivers
   versions 2.0 and 2.1 print TrueType fonts correctly to the HP
   DeskJet 500C if you select the Black Only option in the
   Printer Setup dialog box. TrueType fonts do not print to any
   other DeskJet models using these printer drivers because they send
   information in a compressed mode. The 500C is the only
   model that can understand the compressed data. Printing TrueType
   fonts to other DeskJet models may result in black blocks or smeared
   ink.

</PRE>HP DeskJet Version 3.0 for Windows 3.1
(DESKJETC.DRV)

   Recommend:   Re-install the HP driver version 3.0 for the DeskJet

   Problem 3    Color bleeds on the 550C when you print combined
                color and black in the same print job
   Recommend:   Change the Ink Control option to Minimize Black &amp;
                Color Mixing. Ink Control is found in Print Setup

</PRE><h2>Printer Drivers Supplied By Microsoft Corporation</h2>
 
<P>
Windows Version 3.1: HP DeskJet 500 Version 1.1
(HPDSKJET.DRV)
 
<P>
<PRE>   Models:      DeskJet, DeskJet Plus, DeskJet 500
   Fonts:       Internal, cartridges, and TrueType
   Problem 1:   Unable to use DeskJet scalable fonts
   Recommend:   Update to HP DeskJet Series version 4.0 driver
   Problem 2:   TrueType fonts in graphs print incorrectly.
   Recommend:   Problem was corrected in Microsoft version 2.0 driver
   Problem 3:   Color printing not supported
   Recommend:   Use DESKJETC.DRV version 4.0 from HP

</PRE>NOTE: The Windows Universal Printer Driver (UNIDRV.DLL) does not
support the scalable fonts that ship with the HP DeskJet drivers.
<P>
If you select the HP DeskJet 500C and choose the Install button,
Windows version 3.1 asks for an unlisted printer driver disk because
it expects the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) disk that comes
with the printer (this disk contains the HP DeskJet Series version 2.1
driver). If you insert the Windows version 3.1 Disk 6 (3.5 inch) or
Disk 7 (5.25 inch) instead, the error message "Cannot find UNIDRV.DLL"
occurs. This message occurs because the Windows DeskJet 500C driver is
incompatible with the Windows version 3.1 Universal Printer Driver.
<P>

(HPDSKJET.EXE)

   Recommend:   Update to HP DeskJet Series version 4.0 driver.

to version 1.0, supplied with Windows version 3.1. It corrects the
problem with incorrect extended characters printing when using font
cartridges from Pacific Data Products.
