<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
VSafe Manager (MWAVTSR.EXE) is a Windows-based application that allows
bidirectional communication with VSafe.
<P>
VSafe is not a Windows-based application; therefore, if you are running
Windows, the only way VSafe can inform you that there is a problem is to
cause the system to beep. When VSafe Manager is running, VSafe can send you
messages through VSafe Manager. In addition, VSafe Manager lets you change
VSafe settings while Windows is running.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The most common problem with VSafe Manager occurs when Windows beeps as you
start it. This beeping occurs after you have upgraded Windows because VSafe
checks the files that are loading against the CHKLIST.MS file in the
loading file's directory. If they don't match, VSafe tries to prevent the
file from loading.
<P>
NOTE: The problem also occurs if you delete and then reinstall Windows.
<P>
To work around this problem, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Rescan your disk with Microsoft Anti-Virus after upgrading to create
   new checksum files.
<P>
</UL>-or-

<UL><LI>Delete the current checksum files.
<P>
</UL><h3>Creating New Checksum Files</h3>
 
<P>
To create new checksum files:

<OL><P><LI>From the Options menu, choose Set Options.

<P><LI>Select the Create New Checksums check box and choose the OK button.

<P><LI>Select the drive you want to scan and choose the Detect button.
<P>
</OL><h3>Deleting the Current Checksum Files</h3>
 
<P>
To delete the checksum files:

<OL><P><LI>Select the drive from which you want to delete the checksum files.

<P><LI>From the Scan menu, choose Delete CHKLIST Files.
