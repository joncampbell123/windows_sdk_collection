<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Windows 98
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install or run a program, you receive an error message stating
that the program requires Windows version 3.1 or later.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you start a program, the program checks the Windows version number
to determine whether it can run safely. Some programs check this version
number incorrectly and return an error message.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You may be able to work around this problem using one of the following
methods:

<UL><LI>Try the following steps to run the program in Windows 95:
<P>
   1. Click the Start button, click Run, type "mkcompat" (without
<P><PRE>      quotation marks) in the Open box, then click OK.
</PRE><P>
   2. On the File menu, click Choose Program.
<P>
   3. Select the program's executable file so that it appears in the
<P><PRE>      File Name box, then click the Open button.
</PRE><P>
   4. Click the Lie About Window's Version Number check box to select
<P><PRE>      it.
</PRE><P>
   5. On the File menu, click Save.
<P>
   6. Quit the Make Compatible tool.
<P>
   7. Try running the program again.
<P>
   NOTE: If the executable filename is INSTALL or SETUP, perform these
   steps again and remove the check mark in step 4 after you have
   successfully installed the program. The presence of this setting can
   cause other installation programs to fail.

<LI>Contact the program's manufacturer to determine if an upgrade is
   available.

<LI>Try the following steps to manually update the Win.ini file so that
   the program will run in Windows 95:
<P>
   1. Start Windows Explorer.
<P>
   2. Open the folder containing the executable file you want to run.
<P>
   3. Use the right mouse button to click the executable file, then
<P><PRE>      click Quick View on the menu that appears. Note the module name in
      the Quick View window.
</PRE><P>
   4. Use any text editor (such as WordPad) to open the Win.ini file.
<P>
   5. In the [Compatibility] section of the file, add the following
<P><PRE>      line
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         &lt;ModuleName&gt;=0x00200000

      where &lt;ModuleName&gt; is the name you noted in step 3.

   6. Save and close the Win.ini file.

   7. Try running the program again.

   NOTE: If the module name is INSTALL or SETUP, restore the original
   value to the INSTALL= line. The default value is INSTALL=0x00400000.

   If these steps do not work, you may want to contact the program's
   manufacturer to make sure you are using the correct module name, or
   to determine if there are other workarounds.
