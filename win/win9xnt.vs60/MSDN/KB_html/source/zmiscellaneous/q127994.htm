The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to use a 16-bit non-TAPI-aware communications program in
Windows 95 you may receive one of the following error messages:

<UL><LI>The port is already open.

<LI>Could not initialize port.

<LI>The selected COM port is either not supported or is being used by
   another device. Select another port.
<P>
</UL>When you run modem diagnostics from the Modems utility in Control Panel,
you receive the following error message with "OPENCOMM" in the title bar:
<P>
<PRE>   Port already open

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can occur for the following reasons:

<UL><LI>If the Dial-Up Networking server is installed and set to Allow
   Caller Access, the COM port is effectively locked to non-TAPI-
   aware applications. This may not be obvious because the Dial-Up
   Networking server does not place an icon on the taskbar.

<LI>If you set Microsoft Fax to answer incoming calls automatically,
   the COM port is effectively locked to non-TAPI-aware applications.

<LI>There is a hardware (IRQ) conflict. To check for IRQ conflicts,
   use the right mouse button to click My Computer, then click
   Properties on the menu that appears. Click the Device Manager
   tab, then check the properties for each device.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, you must set the TAPI-aware application to
not answer incoming calls. After you have used the non-TAPI-aware
application, set the TAPI-aware application to answer incoming calls
again.
<P>
The Dial-Up Networking server (available as an add-on) and Microsoft Fax
are examples of TAPI-aware applications that you can set to answer
incoming calls automatically. To set these applications to not answer
incoming calls, follow the steps in the sections below.
<P>
<P><h3>Dial-Up Networking Server</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories,
   and then click Dial-Up Networking.

<P><LI>On the Connections menu, click Dial-Up Server.

<P><LI>Click the No Caller Access option button, then click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Microsoft Fax</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Double-click the Microsoft Fax Status icon on the taskbar.
<P>
   NOTE: If this icon is not present, first double-click the Inbox
   icon on the desktop, then click the Fax profile if prompted.

<P><LI>On the Options menu, click Modem Properties, then click Don't Answer
   in the Answer Mode section.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
These error messages do not occur when you are using TAPI-aware programs
such as HyperTerminal.
