The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Workgroup Templates 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Workgroup Templates is a set of tools for developing powerful
workgroup solutions with Microsoft applications and Microsoft database and
development tools. You can use the templates as a starting point for
building new applications that integrate desktop applications and tools
with database, messaging, and scheduling services. Microsoft Workgroup
Templates is intended for developers who extend and customize the
templates for other users.
<P>
For more information about downloading the templates, see the "To Download
a Template File" section of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Collaboration Templates</h3>
 
<P>
With collaboration templates, multiple users contribute to the same
document or spreadsheet.

<UL><LI>The Expense Report Template (EXPENSE.EXE)
<P>
   The Expense Report template makes it easy to compose, to distribute, and
   to approve expense reports within an organization. The template provides
   a standard expense report for all employees. In addition, the template
   summarizes expenses according to categories that the organization
   defines. Employees record their expenses in the expense report, and then
   send a copy through Mail to their manager for approval. Managers review
   the expense report, and either approve it and send it to an accounting
   department, or do not approve it and send a notification message back to
   the employee.

<LI>The Report Consolidation Template (REPORT.EXE)
<P>
   With the Report Consolidation template, a document owner creates a
   report by distributing different sections to contributors and then by
   consolidating the sections as contributors return them. The template
   adds macros and custom commands to the Microsoft Word word-processing
   program.
<P>
   The document owner first creates a master document, which organizes the
   sections of the report, and then defines the sub-documents and
   distributes them to contributors through Microsoft Mail. In turn,
   contributors complete drafts of their sub-documents and return them to
   the document owner through Mail. Finally, the owner merges the returned
   sub-documents into the original master document.
<P>
</UL><h3>Activity Management Templates</h3>
 
<P>
Activity management templates record activities, action items, or documents
associated with projects or customers.

<UL><LI>The Customer Tracking Template (CUSTOMER.EXE)
<P>
   With the Customer Tracking template, users can record customer and
   contact information, as well as sales and customer service actions, in a
   relational database. The Customer Tracking template uses a file cabinet
   model to organize information on potential or actual customers into
   drawers or categories. Each folder within a drawer represents a company,
   and each company may have many contacts and actions in its folder. With
   the template, users can enter planned actions (meetings, tasks, or phone
   calls) related to a customer. The template stores the actions in both
   the Customer Tracking database and in Schedule+, and users can access
   Schedule+ group scheduling features directly from the Customer Tracking
   template.

<LI>The Expertise Planner Template (EXPERT.EXE)
<P>
   The Expertise Planner template allows a team leader to maintain a
   database of people and their particular capabilities. The template
   enables the team leader to schedule assignments by matching required
   skills with available people. Users maintain their individual schedules
   in Microsoft Schedule+, and the team leader uses the template to read
   their schedules and determine availability. When the team leader selects
   a person for an assignment, the template books the project as an
   appointment on the person's Schedule+ calendar.

<LI>The Meeting Coordinator Template (MEETING.EXE)
<P>
   The Meeting Coordinator template helps meeting organizers to schedule
   meetings and to coordinate the receipt and distribution of meeting
   materials such as documents, graphs, and presentation slides. The
   template supplements the Microsoft Schedule+ group scheduling and
   invitation functions by allowing meeting organizers to import meetings
   from their Schedule+ calendar into a database, to store documents for
   the meeting in the database, and to distribute documents from the
   database to attendees, either by providing shared access to the database
   or by sending the documents through Mail.
<P>
   The template also includes an electronic form for meeting attendees, who
   can use the form to send documents to the meeting coordinator through
   Mail. The meeting coordinator uses the template to retrieve submitted
   objects and to store them in the database.

<LI>The Service Requests Template (SERVICE.EXE)
<P>
   The Service Requests template allows your technical support department
   to maintain a database of incidents and actions. End-users report
   incidents, questions, or problems that support managers then log in the
   Service Requests database and assign to support engineers. When a
   support engineer accepts the assigned incidents, the template
   automatically creates new entries in the engineer's Schedule+ calendar
   and task list. As engineers work to resolve or to close the incident,
   they log their actions in the database, and the template automatically
   sends notification messages to end-users to inform them of the status of
   their incidents.

<LI>The Status Reporting Template (STATUS.EXE)
<P>
   With the Status Reporting template, project owners create projects and
   related activities, some of which they may assign to other users.
   Project owners then send assignment notifications through Microsoft
   Mail. Users can review the details of a project and accept or decline
   assigned activities. When a user accepts an activity, the template adds
   the project and activity to the user's Schedule+ task list.
<P>
</UL><h3>Electronic Form and Routing Templates</h3>
 
<P>
Electronic form and routing templates present structured documents that
users send to other users or to automatic processes.

<UL><LI>The Help Desk Template (HELPDESK.EXE)
<P>
   The Help Desk Template is an electronic form for requesting assistance
   or information from a help desk or support department. The template
   provides basic fields for typical support requests such as problem
   description, and software names and versions. The template also
   automatically attaches configuration files, such as the WIN.INI file, to
   the E-form message and automatically detects the user's configuration.

<LI>The Remote Query Template (RQUERY.EXE)
<P>
   With an application built with the Remote Query template, users can send
   queries to a remote database--a database to which the user does not have
   a direct network connection. Users complete a Query form and route it to
   a query processing agent. The query processing agent is an automatic
   process that accepts the query, runs it, and sends an answer to the
   user. Users read data returned by the processing agent in an Answer
   form. The template uses Mail to exchange information between users and
   the query processing agent.

<LI>The Supply Order Template (SUPPLY.EXE)
<P>
   The Supply Order template provides employees with electronic order forms
   to order supplies through Microsoft Mail. This template automatically
   routes employee orders to managers. Managers can then use electronic
   approval forms to automatically send approved orders to the supply
   department, or to return notification of disapproved orders to the
   employee.

<LI>The Travel Reservations Template (TRAVEL.EXE)
<P>
   The Travel Reservations template is an electronic form for requesting
   travel reservations. The template provides basic fields for typical
   travel requests such as destination, departure time, and arrival time.
   The template also records an individual's travel profile, so that the
   user does not need to repeatedly re-enter common fields such as
   preferred airline seating or meal selection.
<P>
</UL><h3>Developer Libraries</h3>
 
<P>
The following libraries enable developers using Microsoft Office and Visual
Basic to add Microsoft Mail and Schedule+ functionality to their
applications.

<UL><LI>Microsoft Schedule+ Libraries for Visual Basic and Access Basic
   (SPLUSLIB.EXE)
<P>
   The Microsoft Schedule+ calendaring and scheduling program Libraries
   allow you to develop applications that manipulate appointments and tasks
   on users' calendars, and they also allow you to exchange meeting
   messages between Microsoft Schedule+ users. The Schedule+ Libraries
   function set is divided into two categories:
