<P>
Word 7.0 supports conversion to and from a number of foreign file formats,
including word processor, spreadsheet, and database files. Word interprets
some foreign formats internally and others through use of external
converter files or ODBC drivers. A list of available converters and the
formats they support is included below.
<P>
For more information on converter registration and file locations and on
which converters are installed with each of Word's Typical, Compact, and
Custom Setup options, please see the following articles in the Microsoft
