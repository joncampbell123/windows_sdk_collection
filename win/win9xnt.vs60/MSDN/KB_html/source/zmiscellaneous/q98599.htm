</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
LAN Manager comes with WIN_SOCK.DLL and WSOCKETS.DLL, which provide the
interface required for various third party applications to work with
Microsoft's TCP/IP stack. Windows Sockets is a multivendor application
programming interface (API) standard that was developed to provide a
unified standard API set for Microsoft Windows applications to interface
with a specific TCP/IP implementation.
<P>
Windows Sockets Support for Microsoft LAN Manager 2.2 TCP/IP (WINSOCK.DLL)
is included in the Microsoft LAN Manager version 2.2c for MS-DOS client
(also called Microsoft Network Client version 2.2c). Microsoft LAN Manager
version 2.2c for MS-DOS is available on the Windows NT Server CD-ROM in the
CLIENTS\LANMAN\DISKS\DISK1 directory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Hewlett-Packard (HP) provided the WIN_SOCK.DLL for the LAN Manager 2.1,
2.1a and 2.2 TCP/IP stack. Many third party applications use this dynamic
link library (DLL) to run through the TCP/IP stack. WSOCKETS.DLL was later
provided to make Windows calls look as identical as they do in MS-DOS.
These two DLLs do not implement the Windows Sockets API Standard.
<P>
The Windows Sockets API Standard was developed to provide an open standard
interface for network programming under Microsoft Windows. The Windows
Sockets Standard implementation defines a standard interface between a
Microsoft Windows application and a TCP/IP protocol implementation. An
application written for this interface will run unchanged over TCP/IP
implementations from many different vendors under Windows and Windows NT.
<P>
The interface is based on the popular "sockets" paradigm, which facilitates
porting software from UNIX and other environments. It includes a number of
Windows-specific extensions that let application writers integrate the
networking portions of their applications into the message-driven Windows
programming model.
<P>
The specification is intended for use with all current and future versions
of Microsoft Windows, including Windows versions 3.0, 3.1 and Windows NT.
Note that the Windows Sockets Standard compliant DLL will be provided by
the vendor providing the TCP/IP stack. The DLL and the protocol stack
implementation cannot be mixed and matched with other TCP/IP and DLL
implementations. For example, you cannot use the Windows Sockets DLL
provided by FTP Software with Microsoft's TCP/IP stack or vice versa.
<P>
Here are some of the vendors participating in the Windows Sockets Standard
specification:
<P>
3Com Corp.
Distinct Corp.
FTP Software
Frontier Tech.
IBM
JSB Corp.
LAN Design
Microdyne
Microsoft
NetManage
Sun Microsystems
