<P>
To categorize articles within the Microsoft Knowledge Base (KB) and to make
finding information easier, Microsoft has developed a common set of
keywords for use throughout the KB.
<P>
Each KB article has at least one subject keyword, and the first keyword in
the list is the primary subject category for that article. There may be
additional secondary subject keywords on that same line as well as type
keywords (such as kbhowto and kbfile) that categorize the type of the
article (such as a how-to article or an article that points to a file).
<P>
NOTE: The kbfile type keyword is required in all articles that point to a
file in the Microsoft Software Library (MSL) in addition to the primary
subject keyword.
<P>
NOTE: At the end of this article is a table that lists formerly used
keywords and their replacements.
