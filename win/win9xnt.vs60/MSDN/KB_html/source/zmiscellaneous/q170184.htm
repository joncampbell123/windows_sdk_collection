<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to reinstall a sound card driver, you receive the
following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Insert Disk
   The disk labeled 'DirectSound Drivers' is now required
   This disk is provided by your computer manufacturer.
   Click OK to continue.

</PRE>If you are reinstalling a display card driver, the message will instead
refer to DirectDraw Drivers not DirectDraw Drivers.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Insert your DirectX game CD-ROM. If necessary, use the Browse button to
search for one of the following folders on your game CD-ROM:
<P>
<PRE>   DIRECTX\DRIVERS\AUDIO\BIN
   DIRECTX\DRIVERS\DISPLAY\BIN

</PRE>For video card drivers, use the Display\Bin folder. For sound card drivers,
use the Audio\Bin folder.
<P>
If this doesn't work, insert your original manufacturer-provided driver
disc. Many newer drivers from hardware manufacturers are also DirectSound
or DirectDraw drivers. You can use the Browse button to look for the driver
folder on the manufacturer-provided disk.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Many games designed for Windows 95 use DirectX. DirectX includes a set of
updated drivers for popular audio and display cards. These games include
the full DirectX package on the CD-ROM, including the updated drivers.
<P>
Hardware manufacturers also provide new drivers that support DirectX.
The "Insert Disk" message can refer to either the game compact disc or a
manufacturer-provided disc.
<P>
<P><h3>Replacing Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
If you are attempting to replace a driver, and have another disc that
is not being accepted, you can remove the list of DirectSound or DirectDraw
drivers from Windows 95. The list is installed in the Windows\Inf folder.
<P>
To remove the list of DirectSound drivers, delete the following folders:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\Windows\Inf\Msdsound.inf
   C:\Windows\Inf\Msdsound (the entire folder)

</PRE>Where C:\ is the letter of the hard drive where you installed Windows.
<P>
To remove the list of DirectDraw drivers, delete the following:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\Windows\Inf\Msddraw.inf
   C:\Windows\Inf\Msddraw (the entire folder)

</PRE>You can restore these files by running Dxsetup.exe, located on your game CD-
ROM.
