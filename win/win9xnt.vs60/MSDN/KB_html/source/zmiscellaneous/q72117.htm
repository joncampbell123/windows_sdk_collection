The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 2.0, 2.0a,
   2.0a-CD, 2.0b, 2.0c, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.1, 5.1a, 6.0,
   6.0.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Word supports conversion of WordPerfect 5.x secondary merge
files, but not conversion of WordPerfect 6.x secondary merge files.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A WordPerfect 6.x document can be opened in Word 6.x or later, provided the
WordPerfect 6.x import converter has been installed. However, the format of
an imported secondary file is not valid as a Word 6.x data document unless
you edit it prior to performing a mail merge.
<P>
Word 6.x and later support direct conversion of secondary files from
WordPerfect 5.0 and 5.1 for MS-DOS and WordPerfect 5.1 and 5.2 for Windows.
Word 6.x and later can use the imported secondary file in a mail merge. To
use a WordPerfect 5.x secondary file, simply open the file in Word 6.x or
later, or access the file in a mail merge.
<P>
The following Word programs do not support direct conversion of WordPerfect
5.x secondary files and require a workaround:

<UL><LI>Word for Windows versions earlier than 6.0
<LI>Word for the Macintosh versions earlier than 6.0
<P>
</UL><h3>WordPerfect 5.x Secondary files and Word 6.x and Later</h3>
 
<P>
Word 6.x and later versions automatically detect and convert WordPerfect
5.x secondary merge files to Word data source document format, provided the
appropriate text converter is installed. To open the WordPerfect 5.x
secondary file simply open the file in Word 6.x or later, or access the
file in a mail merge.
<P>
Secondary files containing 31 fields or fewer become tables, and those with
more than 31 fields become tab-delimited data documents. WordPerfect
conditional print merge constructs and macros are not retained. WordPerfect
{END FIELD} and {END RECORD} merge commands must be properly placed in a
WordPerfect file or field data may be placed in the wrong column or row
after conversion to Word.
<P>
<P><h3>WordPerfect 5.x Secondary Files and Versions of Word Earlier Than 6.x</h3>
 
<P>
Versions of Word earlier than 6.x do not support conversion of WordPerfect
5.x secondary merge files.
<P>
When converting a secondary file from WordPerfect, the document text and
layout will be retained, but merge commands appearing within braces (for
example, {FIELD NAMES}, {END FIELD}, and {END RECORD}) are lost. The
WordPerfect secondary document layout is not a valid data document layout
for Word
<P>
<P><h3>WordPerfect 6.x Secondary Files and Word 6.x and Later</h3>
 
<P>
Word for Windows versions 6.x and later can open a WordPerfect 6.x
secondary file if the WordPerfect 6.x import converter has been installed.
However, the file will be interpreted as a normal WordPerfect document.
<P>
When converting the WordPerfect 6.x secondary file, the document text and
layout will be retained, but merge commands appearing within braces (for
example, {FIELD NAMES}, {END FIELD}, and {END RECORD}) are lost.
<P>
<PRE>   NOTE: Word for Windows version 6.x users will need to obtain the
   WordPerfect 6.x for Windows import text converter, which is supplied
   on the Supplemental WordPerfect Conversions Kit disk.

   For additional information about the Supplemental WordPerfect
   Conversions Kit, please see the following article in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:

      TITLE     : Word 6.0 WordPerfect Conversion Kit Available

</PRE><h3>WordPerfect 6.x Secondary Files and Versions of Word Earlier Than 6.x</h3>
 
<P>
Versions of Word earlier than 6.x do not support direct conversion of
WordPerfect 6.x files. You must save the WordPerfect 6.x file in an
intermediary format, such as the version of Word being used, an earlier
WordPerfect format, or Rich Text Format (RTF), before you can open it in
Word
<P>
<P><h3>How to Import a WordPerfect Secondary File</h3>
 
<P>
Use the appropriate method below to import:

<UL><LI>A WordPerfect 5.x secondary file into versions of Word earlier than
   6.x
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>A WordPerfect 6.x secondary file into any version of Word.
<P>
<P>
</UL>Method 1: Use If You Have Access to WordPerfect:
<P>
Create a new primary document in WordPerfect 5.x or 6.x such that when
it is merged with the secondary file, the resulting merged file is in a
valid data document format that Word can use in a print merge. Use the
appropriate method for your version of WordPerfect to accomplish this.
<P>
<PRE>   WordPerfect 5.x:
   
    1. Open the secondary file in WordPerfect and determine whether the
       records are in the correct format. Each record should appear on a
       separate page and should have the same number of {END FIELD}
       codes. If any record contains fewer {END FIELD} codes than any
       other record, the record contains fewer data categories than the
       other records. This format causes an error if used in a Word
       merge unless an {END FIELD} code is inserted as a place holder for
       each missing data category of information in each record.
   
    2. Create a new WordPerfect document.
   
    3. Type one quotation mark ("), click Merge on the Tools menu
       and select Field.
   
    4. In the Insert Merge Code Box, type a 1 (The 1 corresponds to the
       first field and so on) click OK. The result is the text "{Field}1~
       in the document.
   
    5. Type one quotation mark which encloses the field in quotes and type
       a comma in order to separate the field from the next field that
       will be inserted. Do not press the ENTER key between fields.
   
    6. Repeat steps 3 through 5 for each field in the secondary file.
       You should also enclose the last field that is inserted in quotation
       marks; it should not be followed by a comma.
   
    7. After inserting all the fields such that they are enclosed in
       quotation marks and separated by commas, press ENTER once and save
       the file with the name Newmain.wpd. An example of the file might
       look like (where &lt;HARD RETURN&gt; represents pressing ENTER once):
   
       "{Field}1~","{Field}2~","{Field}3~"&lt;HARD RETURN&gt;
   
    8. To merge the previously created secondary file, choose Merge from
       the Tools menu, select Merge, type the name of the new primary
       file, Newmain.wpd, in the Primary File box, type the name of the
       existing secondary file in the secondary File box, and click OK.
   
    9. Save the file with a new name and then open the file in Word.
   
   10. If the first line of text in the merged file contains text other
       than actual data, select the entire first line of text and press
       ENTER once. (This deletes the existing first line of text, and
       moves the data to the first line in the file.)
   
   11. Click Replace on the Edit menu, click the Clear button if it is
       available. Place the cursor in the Find What box, type "^d" without
       the quotation marks. Clear any text or spaces in the Replace With
       box. Click Replace All and close the Replace dialog.
   
   12. Place the insertion point at the beginning of the document in
       front of the quotation mark before the first record and press ENTER
       once. Move the insertion point back up to the empty paragraph that
       was created by pressing the ENTER key and type the name of each
       field. Enclose each field name in quotation marks and separate it
       with commas. Be sure not to forget to type any of the names of the
       fields. There should be as many field names are there were
       {END FIELD} codes for a record in the WordPerfect secondary file.
       An example of the first line of text (called a header record
       followed by data might look like:
   
         "firstname","lastname","address","city","state","zip"&lt;HARD RETURN&gt;
         "Jane","Doe","One Main Street","Seattle","WA","98101"&lt;HARD RETURN&gt;
   
       No spaces, punctuation, slashes, or dashes are allowed in the
       header record. No blank lines or text should appear before the
       header record.
   
   13. Save the file.
   
   You can use this document as a Word data document in a print merge.


   WordPerfect 6.x:
   
   NOTE: If the WordPerfect 6.x secondary file is in a table format rather
   than a text format, you can open the file in Word 6.x or later with the
   WordPerfect 6.x import converter and you do not need to follow the steps
   below. You can use the data file after removing the extra paragraphs in
   each of the table cells.
   
    1. Create a new WordPerfect document.
   
    2. On the Tools menu, click Merge, and then click Form.
   
    3. In the Associate a Data File box, type the name of the previously
       created data document and click OK.
   
    4. Type one quotation mark (").
   
    5. Click Insert Field and select and insert a field in the list.
   
    6. Type another quotation mark to enclose the field in quotation marks.
       Then type one comma (,).
   
    7. Type another quotation mark, select another field and insert it.
   
    8. Type another quotation mark and type a comma.
   
    9. Repeat steps 7 and 8 for each field. You should also enlose the last
       field you insert in quotation marks, but should not followe it with
       a comma.
   
   10. After inserting all the field names such that they are enclosed in
       quotes and separated by commas, press ENTER once. An example of the
       file might look like follows (note that ENTER was pressed once only
       after the last field name was inserted):
   
         "FIELD(firstname)","FIELD(lastname)","FIELD(address)",
         "FIELD(city)","FIELD(state)","FIELD(zip)"&lt;HARD RETURN&gt;
   
       No spaces, punctuation, slashes, or dashes are allowed in the
       header record. No blank lines or text should appear before the
       header record.
   
   11. Click Merge, and then click Merge in the dialog box.
   
   12. Click Options, and turn off the "Separate Each Merged Document with
       a Page Break" option. Click OK twice.
   
   13. Click the insertion point before the double quote in front of the
       first word in the document and press ENTER.
   
   14. Move the insertion point back to the first blank paragraph created
       in the previous step and type the name of each field where each
       field name is enclosed in quotes and separated by commas. Be sure
       not to forget to type any of the names of the inserted fields. An
       example of a one record data file might look like:
   
         "firstname","lastname","address","city","state","zip"&lt;HARD RETURN&gt;
         "Jane","Doe","One Main Street","Seattle","WA","98101"&lt;HARD RETURN&gt;
   
   15. Save the file.
   
   You can use the resulting document as a Word 6.x or 7.0 data document in
   a print merge. If you have an earlier version of Word, save the file in
   an intermediary format, such as the version of Word being used, an
   earlier WordPerfect format, or Rich Text Format.


</PRE>Method 2: Use If You Do Not Have Access to WordPerfect:
<P>
It is possible to clean up a WordPerfect 5.x or 6.x for Windows data
document in Word after converting the file directly from WordPerfect
format. However, due to the number of possible variations to the layout
of a WordPerfect data document and the complexity and variations that
are required in a clean-up macro, this method is recommended only if you do
not have access to WordPerfect and cannot use method 1.
<P>
A valid Word data file must be either a comma or tab delimited file, or
must be formatted as a table. If a delimited document is used, the
delimiter must separate each category of information (or data field) for
each record. Each record must have the same number of delimiters, and
each record must be separated from the next record by a hard return.
<P>
If a table is used, data field information must appear in a separate table
cell, and each row (which corresponds to a singe record) must have the
same number of cells. Both types of data files must contain a header
record, which lists all the field names that identify the data field
categories. An example of a two-record tab delimited data file, where
the non printing characters have been noted in brackets, follows:
<P>
<PRE>   First {TAB} Last {TAB} Address {TAB} City {TAB} State {TAB}
   Zip {HARD RETURN}
   Sam {TAB} Elliot {TAB} 3499 Green Hills Rd. {TAB} Beverly Hills {TAB}
   CA {TAB} 98830 {HARD RETURN}
   Kate {TAB} Simmons {TAB} 1104 Calvary St. {TAB} Hampton {TAB} VA {TAB}
   11101 {HARD RETURN}

</PRE>The following method uses the Replace command to arrange a converted
WordPerfect data file for use in Word.

<OL><P><LI>Open the WordPerfect secondary merge file in Word.

<P><LI>View the document and determine whether the records are in the
   correct format. Each record should appear on a separate page and
   should have the same number of tabs. (Turn on non printing
   characters if you cannot see tabs, which look like gray
   arrows.) If a record contains a paragraph mark that is not at the end
   of the last field but is between data fields, delete the paragraph
   and press the TAB key once. If a record has fewer tabs than any other
   record, the record contains fewer data categories than the other
   records. You must determine which data category is missing in the
   record, place the cursor at that location, and insert a tab as a
   placeholder.

<P><LI>Go to Page Setup and change the paper size to custom, 20" width and
   20" length.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Replace, and replace Page Breaks with two
   percent signs. Click Replace All.
<P>
<PRE>   Find What:        ^d        (NOTE: Type ^m in Word 6.X and later.)

   Replace With:     %%

</PRE><P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Replace, and replace paragraph markers with
   nothing. Click Replace All.
<P>
<PRE>   Find What:        ^p

   Replace With:

</PRE><P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Replace, and replace the two percent signs with
   a paragraph marker.
<P>
<PRE>   Find What:        %%

   Replace With:     ^p

</PRE><P><LI>Save the file with a new file name in order to preserve the original
   file. The file should now look like each line contains only one record.
   Each record should begin with the same field information.

<P><LI>Insert a header record as the very first record in the data file,
   where each field name is separated from the others by a tab.
<P>
   A header record inserted at the top of a data file might appear like
   this (non printing characters are not noted):
<P>
<PRE>      name           address                city         state  zip
      Sam Elliott    3499 Green Hills Rd.   Beverly Hills   CA  98830
      Kate Simmons   1104 Calvary St.       Hampton         VA  11101

   No spaces, punctuation, slashes, or dashes are allowed in the header
   record. No blank lines or text should appear before the header
   record.

</PRE><P><LI>Once the header record is inserted, save the file.
<P>
</OL>You can now use this file for a data file in a Word Mail Merge.
<P>
<P><h3>WordPerfect Mail Merge Formats</h3>
 
<P>
WordPerfect's secondary mail merge files are significantly different from
Word for Windows, Word for the Macintosh, and Word for MS-DOS data
documents. In WordPerfect, a data document (by default) aligns merge data
down the left margin with each field on a separate line, and each record
separated by an end-of-record code. In all versions of Microsoft Word, each
record contains fields that are separated by delimiters, and each record is
separated by a hard return.
<P>
The sections below describe the default layouts used by WordPerfect 5.1 for
MS-DOS and WordPerfect 5.x and 6.x for Windows, as well as the somewhat
different format used by WordPerfect 5.0 for MS-DOS. Possible manual
variations of the default formats are also described.
<P>
<P><h3>WordPerfect 6.x Secondary Merge File Format</h3>
 
<P>
By default, a WordPerfect secondary text file created in WordPerfect 6.0 or
6.1 for Windows separates records by using the ENDRECORD merge command
followed by a hard page break. The information in each record is divided
into fields. Fields within each record are separated by the ENDFIELD merge
command followed by a hard carriage return.
<P>
Fields may be referenced in a primary merge document by number or by name.
Fields are automatically numbered by WordPerfect from top to bottom by
default. If names are assigned to fields, these names will appear in a
record at the beginning of the secondary merge file preceded by the
FIELDNAMES merge command.
<P>
Therefore, by default, a WordPerfect 6.x secondary merge file that
includes field names appears similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   FIELDNAMES(Name;Address)ENDRECORD
   (Hard Page Break)
   Mary Jane DoeENDFIELD
   Seattle, WashingtonENDFIELD
   END RECORD
   (hard page break)

</PRE></OL><h3>WordPerfect 5.x Secondary Merge File Format</h3>
 
<P>
By default, a WordPerfect secondary file created in WordPerfect 5.1 for
MS-DOS or WordPerfect 5.1, 5.2 for Windows separates records by using the
{END RECORD} merge command followed by a hard page break. The information
in each record is divided into fields. Fields within each record are
separated by the {END FIELD} merge command followed by a hard carriage
return.
<P>
Fields may be referenced in a primary merge document by number or by name.
Fields are automatically numbered by WordPerfect from top to bottom by
default. If names are assigned to fields, these names appear in a record at
the beginning of the secondary merge file preceded by the {FIELD NAMES}
merge command.
<P>
Therefore, by default, a WordPerfect 5.1 or 5.2 secondary merge file that
includes field names appears similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   {FIELD NAMES}Name~Address~~{END RECORD}
   (Hard Page Break)
   Mary Jane Doe{END FIELD}
   Seattle, Washington{END FIELD}
   {END RECORD}
   (hard page break)

</PRE>You might choose to manually manipulate the layout of a secondary merge
document in WordPerfect. The following are some of the possible manual
variations of the default layout:

<UL><LI>You could insert hard returns following each field name at the beginning
   of a secondary merge document so that the field names appear aligned
   down the left column in the same manner as the actual field entries
   appear by default. In such a case, the example above would instead
   appear as:
<P>
<P><PRE>      {FIELD NAMES}
      Name~
      Address~
      ~{END RECORD}
      {Hard Page Break}
      Mary Jane Doe{END FIELD}
      Seattle, Washington{END FIELD}
      {END RECORD}
</PRE><P>

<LI>You could remove the hard returns that normally follow each {END FIELD}
   code so that each data record appears horizontally across the page in
   the same manner as the field names do by default. In such a case, the
   example above would instead appear as:
<P>
<P><PRE>      {FIELD NAMES}Name~Address~~{END RECORD}
      (Hard Page Break)
      Mary Jane Doe{END FIELD}Seattle, Washington{END FIELD}{END RECORD}
</PRE>
<LI>You could reverse the layout of both field names and field entries.
   In such a case, the example above would instead appear as:
<P>
<P><PRE>      {FIELD NAMES}
      Name~
      Address~
      ~{END RECORD}
      (Hard Page Break)
      Mary Jane Doe{END FIELD}Seattle, Washington{END FIELD}{END RECORD}
</PRE>
<LI>You could not include any field name definitions in the secondary merge
   document, and instead simply make reference to each field in the primary
   document based on its field number. Depending on the horizontal or
   vertical (default) layout chosen for field entries, they are numbered in
   a record either from top to bottom or from left to right. In the example
   above, Name is field 1 and Address is field 2, and the secondary merge
   file would appear by default as:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Mary Jane Doe{END FIELD}
      Seattle, Washington{END FIELD}
      {END RECORD}
      (hard page break)
</PRE><P>
</UL><h3>WordPerfect 5.0 Secondary Merge File Format</h3>
 
<P>
By default, a WordPerfect secondary file created in WordPerfect 5.0 for
MS-DOS separates records by using the Merge E command (^E followed by a
hard page break). The information in each record is divided into fields.
Fields within each record are separated by the Merge R command (^R followed
by a hard return).
<P>
Fields can be referenced in a primary merge document by number or by name.
WordPerfect automatically numbers fields from top to bottom by default. If
names are assigned to fields, these names appear in a record at the
beginning of the secondary merge file, preceded by the Merge N command (^N
followed by a hard return).
<P>
Therefore, by default, a WordPerfect 5.0 secondary merge file that includes
field names appears similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   ^N
   Name^R
   Address^R
   ^E
   Mary Jane Doe^R
   Seattle, Washington^R
   ^E

</PRE>This layout, with the exception of the differing merge commands, is the
same as that used by the more recent WordPerfect versions 5.1 and 5.2. The
same possible variations of this layout as outlined for those versions
above are applicable to WordPerfect 5.0.
