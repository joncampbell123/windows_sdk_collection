<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists troubleshooting steps to help you troubleshoot problems
playing wave sound (.wav) files in Windows. The following possible
problems are addressed in this article:

<UL><LI>Program-specific problems
<LI>Playback device not configured properly
<LI>Mixer settings not configured properly
<LI>Hardware not configured properly
<LI>Damaged wave sound files
<LI>Compression-related problems
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Program-Specific Problems</h3>
 
<P>
If you cannot play .wav files from a specific program that you use in
Windows, check to see if the same problem occurs when you play the file
from another program. For example, if you are attempting to play the file
from a third-party program that is not included with Windows, try
playing the file from Media Player or Sound Recorder. To start Media
Player or Sound Recorder, click the Start button, point to Programs, point
to Accessories, point to Multimedia, and then click Media Player or Sound
Recorder.
<P>
If the problem occurs only with one particular program, the files
associated with that program may be damaged, or the program may not be
configured correctly. To resolve the problem, contact the software's
manufacturer. If the problem occurs with multiple programs, the problem
may be caused by one of the other issues addressed in this article.
<P>
<P><h3>Playback Device Not Configured Properly</h3>
 
<P>
If you cannot play .wav files in Windows, or if .wav files are not
played at the proper volume, you may not have a playback device selected,
or the playback device that you have selected may not be configured
properly. To select and configure a playback device, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the Multimedia icon.

<P><LI>In the Playback box, click the playback device that you want to use in
   the Preferred Device list, and then move the Volume slider to the
   value you want.
<P>
   NOTE: If you are using Microsoft Windows 3.1 drivers with your sound
   card, the sound card should still appear in the Preferred Device list.
   However, the card will not appear in Device Manager.

<P><LI>In the Recording box, click the playback device that you want to use
   in the Preferred Device list, and then move the Volume slider to the
   value you want.

<P><LI>Make sure that the speakers are properly connected to the sound card,
   and that the speakers are turned on.
<P>
</OL><h3>Mixer Settings Not Configured Properly</h3>
 
<P>
If you cannot play .wav files in Windows, or if .wav files are not played
at the proper volume, the mixer control settings may not be configured
properly. You can use the mixer control program included with Windows to
adjust the volume for playback, recording, and voice commands. If you are
using Windows 3.1 drivers with your sound card, you must use the mixer
control program included with the sound card to adjust the volume for
playback, recording, and voice commands. If your sound card does not
include a mixer control program, or for information about using the mixer
control program included with your sound card, please contact the
sound card's manufacturer.
<P>
To configure mixer control settings with the mixer control program
included with Windows, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point
   to Multimedia or Entertainment, and then click Volume Control.
<P>
   NOTE: If you have more than one playback device installed in your
   computer, make sure that the proper device has been selected before
   modifying the mixer control settings. To do so, click Properties on
   the Options menu, and make sure that the proper device has been
   selected.

<P><LI>Make sure that the Mute All check box below the Volume Control slider
   and the Mute check box below the Wave slider are not selected, and that
   the Balance sliders for Volume Control and Wave are in the center of
   the scale.

<P><LI>Move the Volume Control and Wave sliders at least halfway to the top of
   the scale.
<P>
   NOTE: If the Volume Control and Wave sliders do not appear, click
   Properties on the Options menu, and then click the Volume Control and
   Wave check boxes in the Show The Following Volume Controls box to
   select them.
<P>
</OL>You may need to adjust the current Volume Control or Wave slider settings
to play .wav files at the volume level you want.
<P>
<P><h3>Hardware Not Configured Properly</h3>
 
<P>
If you cannot play .wav files in Windows, or if .wav files are not played
properly, your sound card may not be compatible with the type of .wav file
you are attempting to play, or there may be a resource conflict between
your sound card and another device installed in your computer. To
determine whether your sound card supports the wave sound file format you
are attempting to play, contact the sound card's manufacturer.
<P>
For information about determining if there is a resource conflict between
your sound card and another device installed in your computer, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Troubleshooting Device Conflicts with Device Manager

</PRE></OL><h3>Damaged Wave Sound Files</h3>
 
<P>
If you cannot play .wav files in Windows, or if .wav files are not played
properly, the .wav files that you are attempting to play may be damaged.
To determine if a .wav file is damaged, right-click the .wav file in
Windows Explorer, click Properties on the menu that appears, and then
click the Details tab. The Audio Format line should contain information
about the type of compression used to compress the file, the sound quality
of the file, and whether or not the file is in stereo. If this information
is missing, the .wav file may be damaged.
<P>
If the information on the Audio Format line is not missing, attempt to
play other .wav files that are compressed using the same type of
compression as the .wav file you are attempting to play. If you can play
other .wav files, the .wav file that you originally tried to play may be
damaged. If you cannot play other .wav files that are compressed using the
same type of compression, try to play .wav files that are compressed using
a different type of compression. If you can play these files, the problem
may be related to the type of compression that was used to compress the
.wav file you originally tried to play.
<P>
<P><h3>Compression-Related Problems</h3>
 
<P>
Windows includes 32-bit versions of several common codecs, including
Adaptive Delta Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM), Interactive Multimedia
Association (IMA) ADPCM, Groupe Special Mobile (GSM) 6.10, Consultative
Committee for International Telephone and Telegraph (CCITT) G.711 A-Law
and u-Law, and Truespeech from DSP. These 32-bit codecs are installed by
default during Windows Setup, and are used by multimedia programs even
if a 16-bit version of the same codec is available.
<P>
For information about troubleshooting audio codecs in Windows, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
