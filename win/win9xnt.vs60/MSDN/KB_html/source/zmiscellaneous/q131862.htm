<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Many Delta problems can be resolved by following some very basic steps.
This article lists those steps and describes the kinds of errors these
steps help to resolve. Most of this information is not documented in either
the books or the Help files.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Frequently-Encountered Errors</h3>
 
<P>
The following types of error messages are very common and are resolved by
following the steps listed in this article:

<UL><LI>Errors dealing with temporary files.

<LI>Errors dealing with STATUS.MVM.

<LI>Errors when trying to execute commands such as SYNCHRONIZE, JOIN,
   ADD, CHECK OUT, CHECK IN and so on.

<LI>Errors opening MVMDIFF.EXE.
<P>
</UL><h3>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Make sure the AUTOEXEC.BAT file contains the following variable
   declarations. While Delta does not implement the TEMP variable, it does
   use the TMP or the STAT directory tree if the TMP does not exist. Make
   sure there are no trailing spaces at the end of either of these variable
   declarations:
<P>
   SET TMP=C:\DOS
   SET TEMP=C:\DOS

<P><LI>Make sure the AUTOEXEC.BAT file has C:\DELTA as the first item in the
   PATH statement:
<P>
   PATH=C:\DELTA;C:\DOS...

<P><LI>If dealing with a networked environment, set the LOCALDRIVES variable in
   AUTOEXEC.BAT. There should be no space before or after the equal sign or
   between the comma-delimited drive letters:
<P>
   SET LOCALDRIVES=D,E,F

<P><LI>Make sure that there is at least one unassigned drive letter. Delta
   makes a drive assignment, so it needs to have a drive letter available.

<P><LI>If using the LASTDRIVES variable, make sure there are some unassigned
   drive letters between A and the value LASTDRIVES is set to. If in doubt,
   use this setting:
<P>
   SET LASTDRIVES=z

<P><LI>If the computer has a SCSI hard drive or CD-ROM drive, try using a
   semicolon to change the TimerCriticalSection=5000 line in SYSTEM.INI
   file to a comment:
<P>
   ;TimerCriticalSection=5000

<P><LI>Make sure the SYSTEM.INI file has one and only one "device=*vmcpd" line
   in the 386Enh section. The MVMDIFF.EXE file fails if the virtual
   coprocessor device statement (device=*vmcpd) is missing or repeated in
   the SYSTEM.INI file. Delta appears to be working in MS-DOS (outside
   windows), but it issues the MVMDIFF.EXE error when checking in a text
   file from within Windows.
