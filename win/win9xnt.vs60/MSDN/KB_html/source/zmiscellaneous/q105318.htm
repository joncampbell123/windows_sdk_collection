The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.x
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.x, 6.x
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows NT, version 6.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 6.x
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A converter is available that allows Microsoft Word 2.0 for Windows to read
files created by Word 6.0 and 7.0 for Windows, Word 6.0 for Windows NT, and
Word 6.0 for the Macintosh. Word 2.0 for Windows users who don't yet have
immediate access to Word 6.0 or who want to convert Word 7.0 files can
obtain this converter by ordering or downloading the Word 6.x-7.0 Converter
Kit (for Word 2.0 for Windows users).
<P>
Alternatively, if a complete installation of Word 6.0 for Windows exists on
the same computer as Word 2.0, an earlier version of the converter is
immediately available for installation that allows Word 2.0 to open a Word
6.0 for Windows document. This earlier version of the converter cannot open
a Word 6.0 for the Macintosh or Word 6.0 for Windows NT document.
<P>
A complete installation of Word 7.0 does not install a 16-bit converter for
Word 2.0, and you must order or download the converter.
<P>
For information on obtaining and installing either version of the Word 6.0
converter, see the appropriate section below.

</PRE><h3>To Set Up the Word 6.x/7.0 for Windows, Windows NT, and Macintosh Converter</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Windows.

<P><LI>If you ordered the Word 6.x/7.0 Converter Kit, insert the disk you
   received in the appropriate floppy disk drive.
<P>
   If you downloaded Mswrd6.exe from an online service, run Mswrd6.exe to
   extract the files it contains and skip to step 3.

<P><LI>Click the Start button, and then click Run.

<P><LI>Type "source:\setup" (without quotation marks) and press ENTER.
   "Source" is either the letter of your floppy disk drive or the
   directory containing extracted contents of Mswrd6.exe.
<P>
</OL><h3>Installing the Word 6.0 for Windows Converter as Supplied with Word 6.x</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Quit Microsoft Word 2.0 if it is running.

<P><LI>Copy the file Msword6.cnv from the \Msapps\Textconv subdirectory in
   your Windows directory to the Word 2.0 for Windows program directory.
   If this file is not available, run Word 6.0 for Windows Setup again to
   install the converter and repeat step 2.

<P><LI>Restart Word 2.0 and open a Word 6.0 for Windows document that
   has a .DOC file name extension. The converter should now be properly
   installed.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Although the file type referenced during conversion of Word 7.0 files
is Word 6.0, the converter, Msword6.cnv, is the correct converter to use.
<P>
If you have questions about installing or using either version of the
converter, in the United States call Product Support Services at (206) 462-
WORD (462-9673) between 6:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M. Pacific time. Outside the
United States, contact your local Microsoft subsidiary.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
OLE 2.0 support is required for this converter to successfully read a
Word 6.0 or 7.0 for Windows file. The converter therefore does not
work correctly if copied to a computer on which only Word 2.0 is
installed.
<P>
This converter does not run under Windows 3.0. This limitation exists
because Word 6.0 for Windows use object linking and embedding (OLE) 2.0 for
file storage, so several OLE 2.0 files are required for the converter to
read Word 6.0 for Windows files. These OLE files are supplied with the
converter but are not guaranteed to work under Windows 3.0.
<P>
Note also that those formatting features added in Word 6.0 or 7.0 for
Windows that did not exist in Word 2.0 are not retained in conversion.
<P>
The version of Msword6.cnv that is installed with a complete installation
of Word 6.0 is used automatically by Microsoft programs that share
converters, including Microsoft Works for Windows and Publisher for
Windows.
<P>
The 32-bit version of the converter, Mswrd632.cnv that is installed with a
complete installation of Word 7.0 is used automatically by 32-bit
Microsoft programs that share converters including Microsoft Works and
Publisher for Windows 95.
<P>
This converter is not designed for use from within Word for Windows itself.
<P>
Versions of Msword6.cnv that can read only Word 6.0 for Windows files
include:
<P>
<PRE>   Supplied with           File date   File size   Version stamp

   Word 6.0 for Windows    10-27-93    136704      93102000
   Word 6.0a for Windows   01-26-94    137216      94012410
   Word 6.0c for Windows   08-10-94    138240      94080100

</PRE></OL>All newer releases can read Word 6.0 and 7.0 for Windows, Word 6.0 for
Windows NT, and Word 6.0 for the Macintosh files.
