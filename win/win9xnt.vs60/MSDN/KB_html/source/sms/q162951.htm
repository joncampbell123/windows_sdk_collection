<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, version 1.2
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If a computer running Windows NT Workstation has a mirrored boot partition,
there may be problems with remote controlling that computer after the
mirror is broken. If the client computer running Windows NT Workstation is
started from the previously mirrored drive, the Systems Management Server
Remote Control Agent (Wuser32.exe) does not start, because the registry
is still pointing Wuser32.exe to the original drive letter.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
After the computer is started by using the fault tolerant startup floppy
disk to recover the fault tolerant partition, it is necessary to change the
drive letter designation for Wuser32.exe before the second restart.
<P>
To correct this problem, perform the following steps:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

<P><LI>From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\wuser32
</PRE>
<P><LI>Change the string to the drive that Windows NT Workstation is now
   starting from:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Value Name: ImagePath
      Data Type: REG_EXPAND_SZ
      Data: &lt;The new boot drive letter&gt;:\WINNT\WUSER32.EXE
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click OK and quit Registry Editor.
<P>
</OL>At that point, it will be possible to start the Remote Control Service on
the computer running Windows NT Workstation. Wuser32.exe will start, and it
will be possible to remote control the computer. Once the mirrored
partition is completely restored, and the Boot.ini file is changed back to
the original configuration, it is necessary to repeat the above process to
change the drive letter back.
