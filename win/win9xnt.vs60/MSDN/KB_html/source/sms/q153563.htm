The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0 and 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following tasks performed by the Maintenance Manager service may be
delayed:

<UL><LI>RAW inventory files remain on logon servers awaiting collection
<LI>Updated Resync.cfg file not posted to logon servers
<LI>Site property changes involving clients are not reflected in Domain.ini
   on the logon servers
<LI>A site component addition or removal involving logon server components
   does not reach the logon servers
<LI>NetWare logon server performance may appear to be degraded  by excessive
   disk activity. When you check with the Monitor utility on a NetWare
   server, you may see sporadic processor utilization and hard disk
   activity.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Systems Management Server Maintenance Manager service performs
inventory on the NetWare server every 24 hours. This includes software
inventory, if defined. On NetWare servers with large volumes, this can take
a considerable amount of time. Combined with the fact that a number of
NetWare logon server may be defined, the Maintenance Manager service can
take an extended period to perform the software inventory.
<P>
Inventory is initially taken for NetWare servers during the first cycle of
Maintenance Manager after startup. Inventory is again taken 24 hours after
the last inventory of a NetWare server is taken. There is no way to alter
the 24-hour inventory period in Systems Management Server 1.0 or 1.1.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Disable software inventory for each package for which inventory is defined
on the site server.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management
Server version 1.2.
