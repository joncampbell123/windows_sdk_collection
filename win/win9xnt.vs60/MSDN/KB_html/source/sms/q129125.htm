<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
At a Systems Management Server Site which contains Macintosh clients,
Event ID 180 may be frequently written to the system log and several .MIF
files may be created, along with corresponding events in the Windows NT and
Systems Management Server Event Viewers. The Windows NT Event Viewer
application Log and SMS Event Viewer messages have the following syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   Information from module: SMS_INVENTORY_DATA_LOADER.

   Operation:   Validation
   Object:      MIF
   Object name: SMS

   A new machine is being entered into the database. Some of the
   identification attributes for the machine being added overlap with
   another machine in the database.

   Current Machine:
   &lt;SMSID = LAM00002, SMSLocation = LAM|LAMWORLD|, NetCardID =
   08:00:07:B4:AD:65&gt;

   Overlapping Machine:
   &lt;SMSID = LAM0000L, SMSLocation = LAM|LAMWORLD|, NetCardID =
   08:00:07:B4:AD:90&gt;

   MachineName = LAMJAM
   SiteCode = LAM
   Component = SMS_INVENTORY_DATA_LOADER

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Systems Management Server checks the inventory .MIF files from
each Macintosh client for a unique SMSLocation attribute (no other client
in the Systems Management Server Database has the same SMSLocation). The
SMSLocation attribute is a concatenation of the client's Systems Management
Server Site code, Domain, and Name attributes. If Systems Management Server
determines that an inventory .MIF file contains an SMSLocation attribute
that is not unique, Systems Management Server generates a Windows NT Event
and a Systems Management Server Event .MIF file for each machine in the
Systems Management Server database that has the same SMSLocation.
<P>
When the Systems Management Server Macintosh Inventory Agent determines
that a Macintosh client does not have a Macintosh Name defined in the
Macintosh Sharing Setup, the inventory leaves the Systems Management Server
Name attribute blank. Therefore, when multiple Macintosh machines reside in
the same site/domain combination have no Macintosh names, their SMSLocation
is not unique. This generates Event Viewer messages and Event MIF files.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To workaround this problem, define a unique Macintosh name for each
Macintosh client. The Macintosh computer name is created by running the
Sharing Setup application in the Macintosh System Folder's Control Panel.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.0. This problem was corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.1.
