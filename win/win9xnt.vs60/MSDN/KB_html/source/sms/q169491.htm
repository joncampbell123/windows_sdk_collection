The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, version 1.2
<LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can have Systems Management Server Installer generate a status MIF for
your installation by specifying a MIF file name in the Installation Expert
under the SMS tab in the Installation Interface attribute. If a file name
is specified, a .mif file is created in the client's Windows directory to
report the success or failure of an installation or uninstallation of an
application. Package Command Manager (PCM) will pick up any file in the
Windows directory that has an extension of .mif and that was created after
PCM began the installation. PCM sends this back to the Systems Management
Server site server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Fields on the SMS Tab Under Status MIF Information</h3>
 
<P>
Install MIF Filename and UnInstall MIF Filename:
The install and uninstall file name should be &lt;appname&gt;.mif where &lt;appname&gt;
is the name of your application.
<P>
Manufacturer:
This field contains the name of the company who developed the product being
installed.
<P>
Product:
This field contains the name of the product being installed.
<P>
Version:
This field contains the version number of the product being installed. If
you want to specify the language, you can include the %LANG% variable. For
example: 1.00.0 %LANG%.
<P>
Serial Number:
This field contains the serial number of the product being installed.
<P>
<P><h3>Tracing a Success Status MIF</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>A success status .mif file is written to the Windows directory
   (%windir%).

<P><LI>PCM immediately moves the file to the Logon.srv\Despoolr.box directory,
   renames the file, and replaces the .mif extension with .pck.

<P><LI>PCM also writes a status in a .sni file to the Logon.srv\Despoolr.box
   directory. The following is from the Pcmwin.log file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [05/21/97 16:58:28] Package Command Manager ==&gt; Reporting on
      completed package execution.
      [05/21/97 16:58:28] Package Command Manager ==&gt; No error was detected
      while attempting to run the job.
      [05/21/97 16:58:28] Package Command Manager ==&gt; Need to report with
      DMTF MIF: C:\WINNT\ins_note.mif
      [05/21/97 16:58:28] Package Command Manager ==&gt; Writing status
      information to \\MANGO\SMS_SHR\despoolr.box
</PRE>
<P><LI>Maintenance Manager moves the two status files to the Site.srv\
   Despoolr.box\Receive directory.

<P><LI>Despooler compares the two files, and because the status .mif file has a
   status of success, the .pck file is deleted. The following is from the
   Despool.log file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ~Waiting for ready instruction file....
      $$&lt;SMS_DESPOOLER&gt;&lt;Wed May 21 17:09:02 1997~&gt;&lt;thread=DB&gt;

</PRE><P>
   NOTE: Error code "cb" means the command completed successfully.

<P><LI>Despooler renames the file with a .mif extension and moves it to the
   Dataload.box\Deltamif.col directory.

<P><LI>Dataloader writes the success status to the workstation job detail
   record. The following is from the Dataloadr.log file:

</PRE>
<P><LI>If refreshed, the Job Status Details window shows a status of Complete
   for that workstation.
<P>
</OL><h3>Tracing a Failed Install MIF</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>A failure status .mif file is written to the Windows directory
   (%windir%), and the installation is paused.

<P><LI>As soon as the pause is released, PCM moves the file to the
   Logon.srv\Despoolr.box directory, renames the file, and replaces the
   .mif extension with .pck.

<P><LI>PCM also writes a status in a .sni file to the Logon.srv\Despoolr.box
   directory.

<P><LI>Maintenance Manager moves the two status files to the Site.srv
   \Despoolr.box\Receive directory.

<P><LI>Despooler compares the two files, and because the status .mif file has a
   status of failed, the .sni file is deleted.

<P><LI>Despooler renames the .pck file to *.emf and moves it to the
   Dataload.box\Deltamif.col directory, while dataloader writes the failed
   status to the workstation job detail record, where it will be
   interpreted as retrying by the system (retrying because the job may be
   run again, and may succeed).

<P><LI>Dataloader also creates an event 374 for the failure where the comment,
   if specified in the Job Properties, contains the description of the
   failure (if available).

<P><LI>Dataloader moves the .mif file to the Siterep.box directory, where Site
   Reporter deletes the file or forwards it to the parent site (if there is
   one).
<P>
</OL>You can run an ad hoc query on Systems Management Server events with
jobid=xxxxx and eventid=374. The results of this query will list all
workstations where the job failed for that jobid.
<P>
If logging is enabled for PCM, the description of the failure may be noted
in the client's Ms\Sms\Pcmwin.log (or the log name specified) file.
