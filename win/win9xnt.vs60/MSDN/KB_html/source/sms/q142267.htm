The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a client computer connects to a Systems Management Server logon server
using Remote Access Service (RAS), the inventory runs even though it is a
slow network connection.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When NETSPEED.COM reads NETSPEED.DAT through a hardware or software
compression capable link, the contents of the file may be compressed
and NETSPEED returns a false speed reading.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>Start Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE) and locate the following Registry
   subkey in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree:
<P>
   \SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Components\SMS_MAINTENANCE_MANAGER

<P><LI>Select the following entry: Slow Net Threshold Speed

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, select DWORD.

<P><LI>Change the Data to 150 (decimal) (see paragraph below).

<P><LI>Click OK and quit Registry Editor.

<P><LI>At the next watchdog cycle, the Maintenance Manager service will
</OL>generate a new NETSPEED.COM in the \SMS\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\client.src
directory.

<OL><P><LI>If necessary, copy the file to the login scripts directory.
<P>
</OL>The value that works best will depend on your network environment.  This
should be tested in two ways.  First, make certain that the SMS script
still runs for clients not dialing in to your network.  This is especially
important in a WAN environment, make sure that remote sites are still being
inventoried.  Secondly, test the fastest dial-up client so they are not
inventoried. It may take several adjustments to locate the ideal threshold
speed for your network environment.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When SMSLS.BAT or SMSLS.CMD runs from a logon script, NETSPEED.COM and
NETSPEED.DAT are used to determine if the network link is above a pre-
defined speed threshold. Depending on the threshold speed set in the
registry and the policy set in the SMS Administrator Tool, SMSLS.BAT or
SMSLS.CMD prompts the user to see if they want inventory performed when a
slow link is detected.
<P>
You can use NETSPEED.COM /V to determine the link speed Systems Management
Server is using. The possible return values are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   0 - Net is fast
   1 - Net is slow
   2 - Net is slow, prompts user

</PRE></OL>Note: Due to file caching on some operating systems, NETSPEED.COM /V will
only return a valid result the first time it is executed.  Disconnecting
and reestablishing the dial-up connection will clear the file cache.
