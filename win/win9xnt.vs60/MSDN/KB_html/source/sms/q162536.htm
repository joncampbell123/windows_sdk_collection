The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Systems Management Server Event 336, "Cannot read Site Control file for
site X from database SQL Server Y" is produced on a primary site where
large numbers of Systems Management Server addresses exist.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
An image of the site control file Sitectrl.ct0 is stored in the Systems
Management Server database. Currently, the maximum size of this image that
can be read from or written to the database, is set by Systems Management
Server to 256 KB. This allows for an approximate maximum of 1,100 sites to
exist in a Systems Management Server hierarchy.
<P>
Attempting to add an address for a new site that already has this
approximate number of addresses defined causes the Systems Management
Server Hierarchy Manager to produce event 336. You can examine the size of
the Sitectrl.ct0 file in the Site.srv\Sitecfg.box directory to determine if
the Site Control image is approaching its size limit.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2.
A supported fix is now available for version 1.1 only, but has not been
fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing
this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific
problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that
contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more
information.
<P>
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems Management Server 1.2
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
