The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0 and 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The services running on a Systems Management Server site require
various administrator-type rights on all site server systems maintained by
SMS. This article describes what rights are required for the supported
configurations.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The SMS service account requires administrative rights on each SMS
maintained server. SMS creates new shares and directories on each installed
server in order to populate them with files.
<P>
On Windows NT and OS/2 servers, SMS installs and starts the Inventory Agent
service. On Windows NT servers, SMS also installs the Package Command
Manager. To install these services, the SMS Windows NT service account must
have the right to logon as a service at each Windows NT server.
<P>
For a single Windows NT domain SMS site, the SMS service account must be at
least a member of the Local Administrators group and have right to logon as
a service. If OS/2 servers are added to the NT domain, the SMS service
account must be in the Global Administrators group
<P>
If an OS/2 domain is added to an existing SMS site, create an identical SMS
user account in the Administrators group on the OS/2 domain (with the same
password). This is necessary because OS/2 does not understand the concept
of Local groups.
<P>
If a NetWare domain is added, each NetWare server must have a supervisor-
equivalent user account identical to the Windows NT SMS account.
<P>
If you add a NT domain to an existing site, create a one way trust
relationship from the new domain to the domain that contains the SMS
service account. Once the trust relationship is active, add the SMS service
account to the Local Administrators group in the new domain and give the
account the right to Logon As A Service. Make sure that you use the full
&lt;trusted domain&gt;\&lt;username&gt; syntax. This ensures that the proper domain
validates the account through the trust relationship.
<P>
When connecting sites together in a hierarchy, no administrative rights are
not required, and you don't have to create a trust relationship between the
sites. The connection address for the respective sites must include the
&lt;destination domain&gt;\&lt;username&gt; of the other site, and the account must
have Change access to the SMS_SITE share.
