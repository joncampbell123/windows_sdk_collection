The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If changes are made to the properties of a package, the message, "Systems
Management Server will update this package at all sites," appears. However,
if changes were made to the package source, these changes are not updated
at all sites.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This message can be construed to mean that any changes to the contents of
the source directory of the package will be updated in both the master copy
and on the master copies on each site. However, no changes to the contents
of the source directory are actually made until a job is sent with the send
phase selecting "even if previously sent." The update to the package refers
to the properties of the package, such as command line changes.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To update the contents of a distributed package (for example, to add files
to or update files in a package), modify the source directory as
appropriate, create a new job for the package, and select the "even if
previously sent" option.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
