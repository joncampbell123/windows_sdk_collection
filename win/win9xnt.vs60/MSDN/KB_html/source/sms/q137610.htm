The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Systems Management Server Senders do not check for free disk space
before sending a package. As a result, if the destination site does not
have sufficient space to store the package the job is retried and
eventually fails. If you are using the LAN sender, win32 error 112 is
logged in the LANSEND.LOG with the following text:
<P>
<PRE>   There is not enough space on the disk.

</PRE>If using the SNA Batch sender, then an entry similar to the following is
logged in the SNABATCH.LOG file:
<P>
<PRE>   ~Attempt to write 65523 bytes to 1_06XCEN.PCK
   ~Wrote 65523 bytes to 1_06XCEN.PCK
   ~Attempt to write 65523 bytes to 1_06XCEN.PCK
   ~Closing remote file
   Error, trying to write beyond the end of the file.~
   ~Deleting remote file 1_06XCEN.PCK
   ~We have 0 active connections

</PRE>Other senders will have similar errors.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid or correct this problem, ensure the destination site has
sufficient space for the package. When determining how much disk space is
needed for a package, factor in the space required for the despooler to
decompress the package once the Sender has completed sending. If the job is
presently in a retrying state, it should complete once sufficient space is
available. If the job has failed, then delete it and create a new job.
<P>
For more information on using SMSTRACE to view Systems Management Server
log files, see Appendix J of the Systems Management Server "Administrator's
Guide" or query on SMSTRACE here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems
Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.
