The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, versions 1.1 and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
From a client computer running Windows NT when a logon script is called,
Invwin32.exe does not always report inventory to the current logon server.
The client runs Invwin32.exe from the correct logon server (based on the
return from the SETLS32 program), but actually reports the .tmp (later
renamed to .raw) file to a different server. The client's Sms.ini file
shows that the Current Logon Server is the server from which it ran the
executables, and not the server to which it passed its inventory.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The actual destination of the .raw file is determined as the server from
which the _Invwn32.dll file is loaded, not necessarily the one from which
Invwin32.exe is run. The choice of server from which to run Invwn32.dll is
made by a random selection from the Domain.ini file.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems
Management Server versions 1.1 and 1.2. This problem was corrected in the
latest Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack.
For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

<P>
If the server selected from the Domain.ini file is unavailable or offline,
logon scripts may cause the client to stop responding for up to 20 minutes.
<P>
If you use verbose reporting, the following is displayed when a Systems
Management Server 1.1 client stops responding:
