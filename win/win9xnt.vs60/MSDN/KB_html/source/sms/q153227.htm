The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you run a "Run Command on Workstation" job, the following message
appears on Windows clients:
<P>
<PRE>   Reboot to Complete Installation

   Please close all running applications. The system must be rebooted to
   complete installation. Press ENTER to reboot.

</PRE>This message appears even though a restart is not required.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The following two files may exist in the Windows directory: _Mssetup.bat
and _Msrstrt.exe. Package Command Manager (PCM) looks for these two files
to determine whether a restart is required. Many setup programs use these
files in the installation process. It is possible that a setup program left
them behind.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Setup programs may construct a batch file containing operations that must
be performed during a restart, by using ExitWindowsExec, and then
restarting Windows. In order to set up multiple programs before a restart,
PCM prevents the restart by displaying the message mentioned above, and
then performs an ExitWindowsExec when the user elects to restart. This also
gives the user a chance to save any work.
<P>
To copy system files that may be in use, or to coordinate multiple or
unattended setups, the batch file of each setup program can be concatenated
to the _Mssetup.bat file. If _Mssetup.bat does not exist, then the batch
file of the first setup program is renamed to _Mssetup.bat. The
_Msrstrt.exe program is called by ExitWindowsExec and runs the batch file
_Mssetup.bat. It then deletes both the batch file and _Msrstrt.exe.
<P>
