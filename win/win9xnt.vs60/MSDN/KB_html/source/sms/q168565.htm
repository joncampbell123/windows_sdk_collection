The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a child site attaches to a parent site, inventory on the parent site
may appear to be inaccurate. Inventory on the child site appears to be
correct, but the inventory on the parent site does not.
<P>
The first child to attach to the parent may appear correct, but the
inaccurate inventory may appear when a second child attaches. Symptoms will
manifest in data that is stored as COMMON rather than SPECIFIC according to
the DMTF specifications. Examples of this would be in the PC_BIOS or Disk
data, although any COMMON storage may be affected. Symptoms may be
displayed as a duplicate drive C or no drive A for certain systems. Other
symptoms may exhibit themselves as well, but depends on the state of the
child and parent databases before the site attachment.
<P>
This problem occurs only during initial site attachments. Any data sent
from the child to the parent after the initial site attachment is processed
differently, and is not affected.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Systems Management Server DataLoader fails to properly increment an
internal value that ensures that the COMMON storage values remain unique
during a site attachment. This only occurs if the COMMON storage attribute
does not yet exist on the parent site. If the component already exists on
the parent site, child site data merging will take place properly for that
inventory component.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
