The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If there are clients with a status of Retrying, then Overall Job status and
Working status will be set to Retrying. However, when the Retrying clients
complete, the Overall Job status and Working status will remain Retrying if
there are other clients with a status of None.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Send a run command on a workstation job to a set of computers.

<P><LI>Some computers install correctly; their status is reported as Complete.

<P><LI>One computer fails for some reason; for example, because there are no
   drive letters available to be mapped. Its status is reported as
   Retrying.

<P><LI>Working Status and Overall Status change from Active to Retrying, as
   expected.

<P><LI>Run the job again successfully on the client that failed before;
   status is now reported as Complete.

<P><LI>Now there are only clients with a status of Complete or None; there are
   no Retrying clients. Clients with a status of None have not yet executed
   the job. However, the Working Status and Overall Status remain Retrying.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
