The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, versions 1.0 and 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
MS-DOS clients that run the DOS extender Dos4gw.exe before Systems
Management Server hardware inventory is collected may result in unlikely
extended memory values in client inventory. For example, an MS-DOS client
with 32 MB of memory that runs Dos4gw.exe in the Autoexec.bat (before
hardware inventory is collected) may report 64 MB of extended memory in
client inventory.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Memory inventory is incorrect because Dos4gw.exe is not closing high memory
area (HMA) handles it uses to access XMS memory. Dos4gw.exe opens HMA
handles to access XMS memory managed by the resident A20 handler (such as
Himem.sys).
<P>
Systems Management Server memory inventory is collected by summing the
total amount of memory in use by the available HMA memory handles. In this
case, Dos4gw.exe is not closing some HMA handles when it quits, leaving two
handles still allocated. In the 32 MB client example Dos4gw.exe opens a
handle for 516K, and another for 30,440K. When Dos4gw.exe exits, it does
not close its HMA handles; when Systems Management Server inventory sums
them with the default handles in use (totaling 31,680K), the extended
memory value is reported incorrectly as 62,636K.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, run Dos4gw.exe after the Systems Management
Server hardware inventory has been collected.
