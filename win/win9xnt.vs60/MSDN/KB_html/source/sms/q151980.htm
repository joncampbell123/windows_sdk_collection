The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to use Remote Control to control a client running French
Windows NT (that has standard French regional settings) from a computer
running English Systems Management Server, you will receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot establish a security context with the client.

</PRE>When the server and the workstation have another configuration (regional
settings), it works without difficulty.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
By a decree of the French government, when you run Windows NT in the French
locale, you must disable encryption. Therefore, Systems Management Server,
and in particular the Remote Helpdesk functions, cannot establish a secure
context in which to operate.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems
Management Server version 1.2. A supported fix is available, but is not
fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing
this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific
problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the service pack release
containing this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more
information.
<P>
If you are outside of the United States, contact the Microsoft Subsidiary
in your area. To locate your subsidiary, see the Microsoft World Wide
Offices Web site at:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/default.htm</A></B>

</PRE>This fix is also available on the Multi-Lingual Client Pack compact disc
for Systems Management Server 1.2, which you can obtain by calling the
Microsoft Order Desk at (800) 360-7561.
<P>
The fix is provided with the following instructions (Readme.wri):
<P>
<P><h3>Remote Control for French Windows NT clients from a US SMS Server</h3>
 
<P>
French Windows NT uses different encryption settings than US Windows NT.
In order to use Remote Control on a French NT client from a US SMS Server,
you must patch the four files provided in this directory into the US SMS
Site Server installation.
<P>
Copy _WUSER32.DLL into the :
SMS\SITE.SRV\MAINCFG.BOX\CLIENT.SRC\&lt;platform&gt;.BIN\00000409\ directory.
Where &lt;platform&gt; is the platform of your French NT client (ALPHA, MIPS or
X86).
<P>
Copy MULTIPROT.DLL into the :
SMS\SITE.SRV\&lt;platform&gt;.BIN directory. Where &lt;platform&gt; is the platform
of your US SMS Server (ALPHA, MIPS or X86).
<P>
Copy SIGHTNT.DLL into the :
SMS\SITE.SRV\&lt;platform&gt;.BIN directory. Where &lt;platform&gt; is the platform
of your US SMS Server (ALPHA, MIPS or X86).
<P>
Copy WUSER32.EXE into the :
SMS\SITE.SRV\MAINCFG.BOX\CLIENT.SRC\&lt;platform&gt;.BIN directory. Where
&lt;platform&gt; is the platform of your French NT Client (ALPHA, MIPS or X86).
<P>
Wait until the files have been replicated into the LOGON.SRV shared
directory and then re-install or upgrade the SMS Client software in
the French Windows NT Client.
<P>
The French version of Systems Management Server 1.2 already contains the
fixed components.
