<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you query on a PC Architecture Group with multiple data records
for its attributes, the SMS Query results display only the first
data record. This may not necessarily be the value that the query
was based on. However, the computer that the information was returned
for is the correct computer.
<P>
The Disk, Packages, Services, and Audited Software groups could have
multiple data records.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is a limitation of the SMS Administrator utility.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To see the detailed information in the data record that matches the query,
double click on a client in the list to reveal the Personal Computer
properties for that system.
<P>
In order to view multiple data records for more than one client at a time,
use a different SQL query tool that is capable of generating reports.
Systems Management Server is accompanied by a copy of Crystal Reports for
this purpose.  It installs with a number of predefined queries and reports
to view your SMS data.  Other tools such as Microsoft Access or Microsoft
Query are also capable of generating similar reports. Before you use those
applications to query the Systems Management Server database, run SMSVIEW
to create the necessary SQL views.
<P>
For more information on using SMSVIEW, query on SMSVIEW in
the Microsoft Knowledgebase and see Appendix I of the Systems
Management Server "Administrator's Guide."
