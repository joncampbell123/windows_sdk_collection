The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After sending a Run Command on Workstation job to Systems Management Server
clients, the Package Command Manager (PCM) creates a .sni file to report
that the package has been successfully sent.
<P>
If the time is set incorrectly on the client workstation, the .sni file
that PCM creates may not be processed.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For those .sni files that were created by a workstation whose time is set
to a future date and time, the Despooler service that processes the .sni
files will record something similar to the following in the Despool.log
file:
<P>
<PRE>   Instruction D:\SMS\site.srv\despoolr.box\receive\sni00001.sni won't be
   processed till 05/13/01 18:04:37 SMS_DESPOOLER  07/27/97

</PRE>As a result, the Job Status details of this job will not show that this
client has run this package, even though it actually has done so.
<P>
To determine which client computer has its time set incorrectly, open the
.sni file in a text editor such as Notepad. The SMSID of the client
computer that created the .sni file is the second sitecode + identifier
listed.
<P>
In the following example, the JOBID is VAQ0000F and the SMSID is VA<B><A href="../urjump.htm">Q00005</A></B>:
<P>
<PRE>   MICROSOFT|SMS|DOMAIN_COMMISSAR_WIREMOVE VAQ VAQ0000F   FV  FVx   x
   FV  FVx   x   VA<B><A href="../urjump.htm">Q00005</A></B>

</PRE>You can use the Systems Management Server Administrator program to cross-
reference the client's SMSID to its computer name.
<P>
In some cases, the Despooler service will create duplicates of the .sni
file(s) that it cannot process. This may result in the accumulation of a
very large number of .sni files in the SMS\Site.Srv\Despoolr.box\Receive
directory.
<P>
You can move these duplicate files to a "temp" directory and delete them.
It is important that you only move or delete those .sni files that have a
future date.
<P>
To avoid this problem, ensure that each client workstation has the time set
correctly. Adding a simple NET TIME statement such as the following to the
user's logon script can accomplish this quickly:
<P>
<PRE>   NET TIME /Domain:&lt;login domain&gt; /SET /Y

</PRE>If a NET TIME statement is used, it should be run after the Systems
Management Server logon script.
