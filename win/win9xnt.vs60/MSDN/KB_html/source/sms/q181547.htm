The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After an inventory scan is performed, Microsoft Office 97 for Windows does
not appear as an installed package for clients, even though Office is
installed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Package Definition File (PDF) provided with both Standard and
Professional editions of Office 97 for Windows and Office 97 Service
Release 1 (SR-1) defines Package Inventory properties for Office. When a
Systems Management Server client runs the Systems Management Server
Inventory Agent, it scans the local drives for files that match the
criteria defined in the Package Inventory properties. The PDFs supplied
with Office 97 and 97 SR-1 check for the Mso97.dll and Off97spec.ini files.
<P>
The Systems Management Server Client Inventory Agent uses the following
definition to check for these files:
<P>
<PRE>   MSO97.DLL
   AND
   OFF97SPEC.INI CRC=0 226 1548

</PRE>NOTE: The cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for OFF97SPEC may be different
based on the version of Office 97 (Standard or Professional).
<P>
The detection rule specifies 'AND' rather than 'OR', therefore, the package
is not detected. This is because these two files are not located in the
same directory.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use one of the following methods (as appropriate to your situation) to work
around the problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Change the Package Inventory Properties</h3>
 
<P>
If you already have an existing Package for Office 97 that was created in
Systems Management Server, change the Package Inventory properties using
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start the Systems Management Server Administrator program.

<P><LI>Open the Packages window.

<P><LI>Open the Package for Office 97 (Standard or Professional).

<P><LI>Click the Inventory button.

<P><LI>Select the line in the Inventory properties that contains 'AND' and then
  click the Toggle button. This changes 'AND' to 'OR'.

<P><LI>Allow time for the Package properties to be replicated to logon servers
  and subsites before you attempt a new software inventory.
<P>
</OL><h3>Change the PDF</h3>
 
<P>
If you have not yet created a package for Office 97, change the detection
rule in the PDF from 'AND' to 'OR'. Perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Locate the file in your Office 97 source.

<P><LI>Open the file in a text editor such as Notepad.

<P><LI>Search for the string "Detection Rule Part 2=AND" (without the quotation
  marks).

<P><LI>Change 'AND' to 'OR'.

<P><LI>Save the file.

<P><LI>Import the file into a new package.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h3>Use a Newer PDF</h3>
 
<P>
Use the newer version of the PDF for Office 97 which is included in Systems
Management Server Service Pack 2 or later. The newer PDF corrects this
problem by removing the Mso97.dll file from the inventory criteria.
<P>

File, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
