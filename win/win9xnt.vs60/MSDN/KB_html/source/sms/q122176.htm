<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
Microsoft recommends that prior to attempting an upgrade of Systems
Management Server site server software, that you perform a Site Reset from
the SMS Setup program. This is intended to ensure that all service
components are properly responding to service control commands for stopping
and starting.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
During an upgrade of the Systems Management Server site server software,
the SMS_Executive service cannot be stopped and reports an error. The
upgrade fails.
<P>
One or more of the following symptoms may indicate that this is the
problem:

<UL><LI>Sometimes after a NET STOP SMS_EXECUTIVE command, Service Control
   Manager responds with "the service cannot be controlled."

<LI>Control Panel shows SMS_Executive is not running.

<LI>NET START shows SMS_Executive is running.

<LI>NET START SMS_EXECUTIVE results in:
<P>
<P><PRE>      System error 1072 has occurred.
      The specified service has been marked for deletion.
</PRE>
<LI>There are many new temporary (.TMP) files in the root of the site drive
   that can't be deleted.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Shutdown and restart the Windows NT server, do a Systems Management Server
Site Reset, and then attempt to upgrade again. There is no way to stop the
service after it was uninstalled while running, other than a system
shutdown. The reset should clean up service problems. The upgrade should
make sure all the correct files have been replaced and the new settings are
correctly entered.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
