The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2
</UL> 
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry  Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After starting the Remote Control Agent service (Wuser32.exe) on a computer
running Windows NT Workstation, performance at the client computer is
reduced and all other applications are slowed down for a few minutes.
Attempting to start any other applications takes a long time. The CPU usage
and Memory usage counters in Performance Monitor do not show a spike at
this time. Everything returns back to normal after a few minutes.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the Remote Control Agent (Wuser32.exe) starts, it sends a broadcast
(if configured for IP) that announces the IP address it is listening on.
Then it attempts to get the security identifiers (SIDs) of all the Windows
NT accounts specified in the registry under the PermittedViewers key in the
following registry location:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE on Local Machine\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\SMS\Client
   Services\Remote Control\Parameters

</PRE>By default, this registry REG_MULTI_SZ key contains the word
"Administrators" in several languages, and Wuser32.exe may take some time
to determine that these accounts do not exist.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, you can modify this PermittedViewers key to
contain the word "Administrators" in English only or in your local language
only.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
After making this modification to the registry, restart the Remote Control
Agent service. It should not slow down the system. All other applications
started after the Remote Control Agent service should start up as normal.
<P>
To make this registry change on all clients at once, you must use the
Systems Management Server Administrator program to make a change to the
site properties. You can do this by clicking the Options button (located in
the Clients window in the Site Properties). From the Remote Troubleshooting
Options window, remove and unneeded user groups from the list shown.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>

Management Server clients, see the following article in the Microsoft
