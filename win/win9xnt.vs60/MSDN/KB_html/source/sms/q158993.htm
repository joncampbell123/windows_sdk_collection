<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Systems Management Server supports clients with the Novell NetWare Client32
Redirector for Windows 95. The Redirector can work quite successfully,
through there are many caveats.
<P>
The Client32 client logs on to a NetWare 3.12 or 4.0 Systems Management
Server logon server. It is not possible to use the Client32 Redirector to
log on to a Windows NT Server domain. There are also potential problems
with Windows 95 dual Redirector clients that log both on to a Windows NT
Server domain and a Novell server, but have Systems Management Server
installed and inventoried by the Windows NT Server logon server.
Troubleshoot these clients with the steps below.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Manually running Invdos.exe /V from the SYS:SMS\LOGON.SRV\x86.bin directory
may result in the following error if Runsms.bat has never been run:
<P>
<PRE>   Error Writing to File 00000000.tmp.

</PRE>If the Runsms.bat has been run once, INVDOS runs correctly.
<P>
NOTE: This problem occurs with both the Client32 and the Microsoft Client
for NetWare Networks.
<P>
Changing between Remote Troubleshooting utilities can be unreliable. You
may have to click the icon for the utility twice to establish a chat, or a
second attempt may result in an "unable to locate" message , forcing you to
quit the Remote utilities, or restart the client to reestablish the
connection.
<P>
Client 32 will be more reliable if you perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use a fresh installation of Windows 95 with:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - IPX Compatible Transport
</PRE>
<P><LI>Run the Setup.exe program of the Novell Client32 with the updated
   Client32.nlm file (dated 9/23/96 or later) in the source.

<P><LI>Configure the Client Logon screen to log on to a preferred server, and
   place a check in the bindery box.

<P><LI>Restart the computer.

<P><LI>Map to the Sms\Logon.srv directory and run the Runsms.bat batch file, or
   run the Smsls.scr logon script.
<P>
</OL>This procedure may fail all or most of the time if any of the following
conditions are true:
<P>
NOTE: The TIDs referenced below are Novell Technical Documents. You can
find them at <B><A href="http://www.netware.com/">http://www.netware.com/.</A></B>

<UL><LI>You have ever attempted to remove the Client32 by either running the
   (Novell) supported Client32 deinstall program or by manually removing
   it from the Network Control Panel (REF: TID2910349).

<LI>The Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks was not installed before the
   Client32 installation (REF: TID2905984).

<LI>An IPX compatible transport was not installed before the Client32
   installation (REF: TID2905984).

<LI>You ran the Smsls.scr without adding extensions to the entries for
   netspeed, dosver and clrlevel (REF: TID2907800).
<P>
</UL>NOTE: The Systems Management Server 1.2 Release Notes mention that you need
to make an entry in the Net.cfg file, but the Client32 does not use the
Net.cfg. file
<P>
The product discussed here, the Novell NetWare Client32 for Windows 95, is
