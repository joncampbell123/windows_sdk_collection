The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 Service Pack 2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If a computer is installed as a Windows 95 Systems Management Server
client, the [SMS] section of the Sms.ini file will report OS=5. If the
computer is then installed as a Windows NT client without having removed
the Systems Management Server client, the following message will appear,
and inventory should not be taken on the client:
<P>
<PRE>   A different OS was detected than that under which Systems Management
   Server was installed. Operating System reported by SMS.INI does not
   match current operating system.
   Exiting
   [SMS 100%]

</PRE>However, Systems Management Server continues and inventory is taken anyway.
One result of this is that the NetcardID is not detected correctly. The
NetcardID changes from the proper value (inventoried under Windows 95) to
&lt;unknown&gt;.
<P>
This problem only occurs if the computer's Sms.ini file was created when
the computer is running Windows 95, and then the computer is started to
Windows NT. A dual-boot computer installed as a Windows NT Systems
Management Server client, then started to Windows 95 works as expected.
Note that Systems Management Server does not support dual-boot computers at
this time.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, run Upgrade.bat from the SMS_SHR share on the
Systems Management Server logon server for those clients affected when
started to Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2 Service Pack 2. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
