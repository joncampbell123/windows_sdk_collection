The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
SMSRUN16 may appear to stop responding during Systems Management Server
logon server selection when underlying networking problems exist. There is
no way to stop SMSRUN16's server selection process.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
SMSRUN16 attempts to verify that at least one Systems Management Server
logon server is accessible to the current logged-on user. In Systems
Management Server 1.2, SMSRUN16 attempts to connect to the server listed as
the CurrentLogonServer in the Sms.ini file. If this connection is
unsuccessful, SMSRUN16 will try each listed server in the [Servers] section
of the Sms.ini file until it successfully connects to a server or exhausts
the list.
<P>
If networking problems exist or some of the logon servers are unavailable
during SMSRUN16's server selection process, the connection timeout, in
conjunction with the number of servers in the [Servers] section, may give
the appearance that the computer has stopped responding. However, control
will be returned to the user after SMSRUN16 has completed its server
selection process.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft
Systems Management Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
(without the spaces):

<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
With the hotfix installed, if SMSRUN16's attempt to connect to the
CurrentLogonServer is not successful, a "Logon server not found" message
box appears. This message box asks:
<P>
<PRE>   Continue looking for logon servers?

</PRE>The user can click Yes to continue looking for logon servers or No to
stop the SMSRUN16 server selection process.
