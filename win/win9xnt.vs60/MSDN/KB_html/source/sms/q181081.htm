The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, versions 1.1 and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Remote Reboot feature of Systems Management Server on a
client computer running Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2), the
following message is displayed during the restart:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows was not properly shut down. One or more of your disk drives may
   have errors on it. Press any key to run ScanDisk on these drives.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Remote Reboot issues a CPU reset instruction, not a graceful shutdown.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do any one of the following:

<UL><LI>Open the Msdos.sys file and add the following line to the [Options]
   section:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Autoscan=0
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: This method completely disables the OSR2 Autoscan feature. The
   kernel does not check the Clean Shutdown and Hard Disk Error bits, and
   ScanDisk is not started.

<LI>Obtain the hotfix mentioned in STATUS section below. This fix should
   have the following timestamp:
<P>
<PRE>      2/9/98   10:05am         144,896    Idisp16.dll

</PRE><LI>Wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack.
<P>
</UL>STATUS
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.1 and 1.2.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-
tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific
problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains
this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows 95 OSR2 includes versions of the Io.sys and Win.com files that
check the Clean Shutdown and Hard Disk Error bits in the Virtual File
Allocation Table (VFAT) during startup. If either of these bits is enabled
(that is, cleared to 0) on any drive present in real mode, you are prompted
to run ScanDisk. If you do not press a key within 60 seconds, ScanDisk runs
anyway.
