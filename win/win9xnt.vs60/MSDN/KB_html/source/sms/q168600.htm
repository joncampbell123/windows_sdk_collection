The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT Server Remote Control (Wuser32.exe) may fail if multiple Systems
Management Server administrators attempt to take control at the same time.
When Remote Control fails, the "Quick Windows Viewer" on the controlling
computer running Systems Management Server will appear to stop responding,
and Wuser32.exe may cause an error to occur on the client computer running
Windows NT Workstation.
<P>
<PRE>   WUSER32.exe Application Error:

   The Instruction at "0x77a835e1" referenced memory at "0x21270028". The
   memory could not be "read".
   Click on OK to terminate the application.
   Click on CANCEL to debug the application.

</PRE>Nobody will be able to take remote control of that computer until either it
is shut down and restarted, or the Systems Management Server Remote Control
Agent Service is restarted.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT Server Remote Control only allows one computer running Systems
Management Server to control the client at a time. If multiple computers
running Systems Management Server attempt to control the client,
Wuser32.exe initially accepts the connections, starts to verify
permissions, and then disconnects the additional Systems Management Server
connections because it is already being controlled.
<P>
When a Systems Management Server connection is disconnected, Wuser32.exe
parses through a list of security contexts held for Systems Management
Server connections. If a security context has been inactive in the list for
more than one minute, Wuser32.exe frees the context.
<P>
When the Systems Management Server administrator that currently has control
of the workstation attempts to perform a remote task in the "Quick Windows
Viewer", Wuser32.exe on the client computer running Windows NT Workstation
looks up the security context for that Systems Management Server connection
to verify permissions. If the Systems Management Server administrator's
security context was freed during the connection termination of another
computer running Systems Management Server, Wuser32.exe passes an invalid
security context to Windows NT Server. The invalid security context causes
Wuser32.exe to cause an access violation (AV) and the "Quick Windows
Viewer" will appear to stop responding.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below. With the
hotfix, Wuser32.exe was modified to cleanup inactive security contexts
without releasing the active Systems Management Server administrator's
security context.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
