The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you delete a group from the Personal Computer Architecture using Systems
Management Server Database Manager, then attempt to re-create the group by
reloading the MIF, the attributes for that group do not reappear in the
Personal Computer Properties window, even if you quit and restart the
Systems Management Server Administrator program as required. Inventory is
reported, but the group and its attributes never reappear.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Inventory Dataloader does not re-create the group class in the Systems
Management Server database.
<P>
You can diagnose this problem by monitoring the Datalodr.log file for
activity similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Waiting for a MIF...
   Processing a machine...
   Requesting license for client S0100001
   CMachine::FindMachine - Searching for matching SMS Unique IDs
   Defining attributes for group GROUPTEST|MYTEST|1.0...
   CGroupMap::AddColumnToSpecificTable - couldn't add column to table
   CDefinedArchitecture::InsertDefinedAttribute - could not add column
   CGroup::DefineAttributes - couldn't defined attribute
   CGroup::DefineGroupAndAttributes - couldn't define attributes for
   GROUPTEST|MYTEST|1.0
   finished processing current machine.
   SQL problem detected, terminating the thread.
   SQL problem detected, terminating MIF processing thread.

</PRE>The Systems Management Server Executive service caches Defined Architecture
in memory. When Dataloader receives a MIF that contains a group that
existed the last time the Systems Management Server Executive was
initialized, it sees the table(s) defined for this group class in cache,
even though it has been deleted using Database Manager. Instead of
re-creating the group class, it attempts to add to it. This results in the
failure noted in the log example above. The MIF is not placed in the
Badmifs subdirectory.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Stop and start the SMS_Executive service on the site server. Doing this
flushes and reinitializes the cache. Inventory Dataloader will then be able
to correctly process the MIF and re-create the group class. It may also be
necessary to force inventory or remove the appropriate computer history
file for the data to appear immediately.
