<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Smsacm32.exe is a Systems Management Server helper program designed to
provide an install wrapper for Systems Management Server shared application
support of Microsoft 32-bit applications. These include Microsoft
Office 95 and Microsoft Office 97 or their individual components (such as
Microsoft Word 7.0, Microsoft Excel 7.0 and so on). Smsacm32.exe was
introduced as a 32-bit equivalent of Smssetup.exe, which is used to install
shared versions of Microsoft 16-bit applications (such as Microsoft
Office 4.2 or Microsoft Word 6.0).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The primary use of Smsacm32.exe is in the Configuration Command Line of the
Program Item Properties for shared Microsoft applications. When the program
item is selected for the first time, the Configuration Command Line is
started by Appstart.exe, which in turn starts the application's Microsoft
Acme Setup (Setup.exe) to perform a workstation setup of the application.
The 16-bit version of Smssetup.exe sets the following registry key to
Success after a successful installation by Acme Setup:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\SMS\APPICATIONS\&lt;Application Registry Name&gt;
   \CONFIGURESCRIPT\STATUS

</PRE>NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
readability.
<P>
After STATUS is set to Success, Appstart.exe would not need to call Acme
Setup again, but instead call the actual application executable from an
available distribution server.
<P>
However, Smsacm32.exe does not set the STATUS to Success after the
successful installation of a shared application, but changes the status
from Failed (changed during Acme Setup in case of failure) to Configure.
This is due to the nature of Acme Setup 3.0, because it creates application
icons under the Windows Explorer Start, Programs menu during installation
of the application. The icons created by Program Group Control (PGC) for
shared applications such as Access 97, Word 97, and so forth are therefore
only used for shared application setup and installation. The applications
themselves are invoked in the normal way through the use of their shortcuts
created from the Start, Programs menu on the task bar. These shortcuts in
turn invoke Appstart.exe to start the application from an available
distribution server.
