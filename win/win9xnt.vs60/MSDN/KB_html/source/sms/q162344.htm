The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible to use the CTRL key and the mouse to select multiple non-
sequential secondary sites for deletion in the Systems Management Server
Administrator program UI. After you select the sites and press the DELETE
key, Systems Management Server will present a confirmation box that asks
"Are you sure you want to delete the selected item(s)?" but does not list
the sites that are going to be deleted.
<P>
Upon confirming the deletion, the Systems Management Server Administrator
program UI begins the deletion of all sites listed between the first and
last item selected, whether or not they were highlighted.
<P>
For example, if you have six secondary sites, and select sites 1, 3, and 5
for deletion, Systems Management Server will remove sites 1 through 5,
including sites 2 and 4.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
