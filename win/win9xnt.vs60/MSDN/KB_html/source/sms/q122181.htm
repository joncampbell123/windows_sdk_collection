</PRE>369    SQL Server Errors =&gt;
<P>
370    X is not setup correctly.
<P>
371    Unable to create MAC volume X on server Y with path Z.
<P>
372    There is not enough free disk space on share A, server B. Available
<PRE>       diskspace is C MBytes, the package requires D bytes.

</PRE>373    There is no NTFS drive on server X, which is needed to decompress
or
<PRE>       copy the package.

</PRE>374    The workstation install job has failed on workstation X in domain
Y,
<PRE>       the description generated by the setup script is Z.

</PRE>375    The package file is corrupted. It either has a bad internal format
<PRE>       or failed CRC check. Have the administrator resend the package to
       correct this problem.

</PRE>376    X caused an exception. Shutting down the SMS Executive.
<P>
377    Site X is attempting to produce an illegal site hierarchy.
<P>
378    Failed to install SMS_BOOTSTRAP service at the secondary site.
<PRE>       Possible causes are the service account doesn't have the proper
       rights, the install drive doesn't exist or the server platform is
       incorrect.

</PRE>379    The SMS root directory X on server Y cannot be an existing
directory
<PRE>       that is not empty. Either delete the directory by hand or choose a
       different directory and redo the secondary site install.

</PRE>380    An SMS alert has been triggered. Alert:  (X) -- . The hit count for
<PRE>       the alert was Y.

</PRE>381    Installation or upgrade of site X has failed. The main site package
<PRE>       (BOOTSTRP.PK1) and/or the site control package (BOOTSTRP.PK2) have
       disappeared from that site's installation directory, where they had
       been previously stored. Installation or upgrade cannot continue. If
       this was an upgrade, SMS_BOOTSTRAP has triggered a restart of the
       secondary site, attempting to restart the previous version of SMS.
       If this succeeds, it should be possible to retry the upgrade using
       SMS Setup to upgrade the primary site again.

</PRE>382    Installation or upgrade of site X has failed. The main site package
<PRE>       (BOOTSTRP.PK1) is invalid, failing internal consistency checks.
       Installation or upgrade cannot continue. If this was an upgrade,
       SMS_BOOTSTRAP has triggered a restart of the secondary site,
       attempting to restart the previous version of SMS. If this
</PRE>succeeds,
<PRE>       it should be possible to retry the upgrade using SMS Setup to
       upgrade the primary site again. Possible causes are: a transmission
       error during sending.

</PRE>383    Installation or upgrade of site X has failed. The site control
<PRE>       package (BOOTSTRP.PK2) is invalid, failing internal consistency
       checks. Installation or upgrade cannot continue. If this was an
       upgrade, SMS_BOOTSTRAP has triggered a restart of the secondary
       site, attempting to restart the previous version of SMS. If this
       succeeds, it should be possible to retry the upgrade using SMS
</PRE>Setup
<PRE>       to upgrade the primary site again. Possible causes are: a
       transmission error during sending.

</PRE>384    Installation or upgrade of site X has failed. SMS_BOOTSTRAP
detected
<PRE>       insufficient disk space to decompress the main site package
       (BOOTSTRP.PK1) or the site control package (BOOTSTRP.PK2).
       Installation or upgrade cannot continue. If this was an upgrade,
       SMS_BOOTSTRAP has triggered a restart of the secondary site,
       attempting to restart the previous version of SMS. If this
       succeeds, it should be possible to retry the upgrade using SMS
</PRE>Setup
<PRE>       to upgrade the primary site again. Possible causes are: low disk
       space on the secondary site server.

</PRE>385    Installation or upgrade of site X has failed. The main site package
<PRE>       has failed during decompression. Installation or upgrade cannot
       continue. If this was an upgrade, the secondary site may now
</PRE>contain
<PRE>       a mixture of files from the previous and new versions and should be
       considered unstable. SMS_BOOTSTRAP has triggered a restart of the
       secondary site, attempting to start the "mixed" version of SMS. If
       this succeeds, it should be possible to retry the upgrade using SMS
       Setup to upgrade the primary site again.

</PRE>386    Installation or upgrade of site X has failed. The site control
<PRE>       package has failed during decompression. Installation or upgrade
       cannot continue. If this is an upgrade, SMS_BOOTSTRAP has triggered
       a restart of the secondary site, attempting to start the new
</PRE>version
<PRE>       of SMS using the old site control file. If this succeeds, it should
       be possible to retry the upgrade using SMS Setup to upgrade the
       primary site again.

</PRE>387    Installation or upgrade of site X has failed. After it was
<PRE>       decompressed, the main site package did not included a master
</PRE>system
<PRE>       map (SYSTEM.MAP). This file should have been in the install
       directory. Installation or upgrade cannot continue. If this is an
       upgrade, SMS_BOOTSTRAP has triggered a restart of the secondary
       site, attempting to start the new version of SMS without the system
       map. If this succeeds, it should be possible to retry the upgrade
       using SMS Setup to upgrade the primary site again.

</PRE>388    Installation or upgrade of site  has failed. SMS_BOOTSTRAP has run
<PRE>       for more than 48 hours at the secondary site without the site
       successfully starting. Installation or upgrade will not continue.
       If this was an upgrade, SMS_BOOTSTRAP has triggered a restart of
</PRE>the
<PRE>       secondary site, attempting to restart the previous version of SMS.
       If this succeeds, it should be possible to retry the upgrade using
       SMS Setup to upgrade the primary site again.

</PRE>389    Cannot enumerate users for domain (X). Possible NT error: (Y)
<P>
390    Cannot enumerate user groups for domain (X). If this is a NetWare
<PRE>       domain, this may be due to the Gateway Service for NetWare not
       running on the SMS site server. Possible NT error: (Y)

</PRE>391    The package includes Macintosh as one its supported platforms.
<PRE>       However none of the package servers are able to support Macintosh
       packages. Please make sure Service for Macintosh is running on at
       least one of the package servers.

</PRE>392    Drive X on server Y is not an NTFS drive, which is required for a
<PRE>       successful secondary site install. Please select an NTFS drive and
       retry the secondary site install.

</PRE>393    Failed to decompress the package on server X, the required space is
<PRE>       MBytes, the drive with most free space only has Y MBytes free.
