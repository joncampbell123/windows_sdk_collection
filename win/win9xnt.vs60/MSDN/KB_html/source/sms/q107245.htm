<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains the text from the Microsoft Systems Management Server
version 1.0 README.TXT file (part 2 of 2).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>

<OL><P><LI>Using Network Applications
</OL>If a user starts an application shared on an SMS server and then leaves it
unattended, the application may fail if the server disconnects the client
while the application is left running unused. To prevent this problem, you
can turn off the autodisconnect feature on the distribution servers for
shared applications.
<P>
If a client is configured to use some server applications (that use the
MSAPPS directory) made available by SMS, and the client also has
applications installed directly on it (not using SMS) that also use MSAPPS,
the locally installed applications will not function properly if a Remove
Package From Server job is used to remove the MSAPPS directory from the
server. In this case, the client's references to the MSAPPS directory will
then point to the non-existent server version.
<P>
Be careful if your clients in a child site receive packages for shared
applications from both their site and that site's parent site. If a client
receives a package that uses MSAPPS from the client's site (a child site),
a Registry key is created on the client that refers to the MSAPPS
distributed by the child site. Later, if packages using MSAPPS are
distributed from the parent site to the client, the MSAPPS Registry key is
not changed, and still refers to the version from the child site.
<P>
If, after that, the administrator decides to make the original MSAPPS
package (from the child site) unavailable, the privileges on the MSAPPS
Registry entry are set to "Deny." Any packages already distributed from the
parent site that refer to MSAPPS will no longer work correctly. Also, any
new packages installed will generate an error saying "MSAPPS is not
installed. Would you like to continue anyway?"
<P>
To solve the problem, be sure to delete any old program groups that include
MSAPPS after they are no longer being used.
<P>
Shared applications made available by SMS cannot support shared documents.
A user running an application shared by SMS cannot use documents shared by
SMS with that shared application. For example, suppose you have installed
Microsoft Word for network sharing. If you also make a package of Word
documents for a Share Package on Server job, users of the shared Microsoft
Word will not be able to use the shared documents.
<P>
You can use the RSAPPCTL.EXE utility to fix any corruptions or out-of-date
problems with the database of shared applications. You may be directed to
use this utility by an error message.
<P>
This utility is located in the PSSTOOLS\platform.BIN directories (such as
X86.BIN) on the SMS CD-ROM.
<P>
Usage:  RSAPPCTL {/SELF} {/ALL} {/SITE:sitecode} {/SITESERVER:servername}
<PRE>_/SELF                  __Resets database for this site (but not child
</PRE></OL>sites).
<PRE>_/ALL                   __Resets NAD for all child sites (but not this
</PRE>site).
<PRE>_/SITE:sitecode         __Resets NAD for the specified child site.
_/SITESERVER:server     __Specifies this site's site server. Needed only if
</PRE>RSAPPCTL is not being
run on the site server.
<P>
You can use both the /SELF and /ALL options to do a total reset of the
local site and all child sites.
<P>
For Share Package On Server jobs that have target distribution servers
running LAN Manager or Windows NT Server, the Despooler will create two
shares when a nested share name and path is specified for the Share Name in
the package's Setup Package For Sharing dialog box. 1) The Despooler uses
the name at the beginning of the path to share that directory (using the
directory name as the share name). For example, if you specified
APPS\WIN\EXCEL, the Despooler will share the APPS directory as the APPS
share. 2) The Despooler then shares the last directory in the path as an
administrative share. This share is used by Program Group Control to
connect to the package server so that it can start a network application
from that share. For example, if you specified APPS\WIN\EXCEL, the
Despooler will share the EXCEL directory as the EXCEL$ share.
<P>
The following section includes more details about troubleshooting if users
have problems running shared applications made available by SMS.

<OL><P><LI>Troubleshooting Network Applications
</OL>Log File First, examine the SMSLOG.TXT file in the Windows directory. When
the SMSLOG.TXT file reaches 8 kilobytes, it is renamed to SMSLOG.BAK and a
new SMSLOG.TXT is started. The format of a message is either:

                                        directory.
Cannot open the temporary STF file.     The ~SETUP~.STF file in the Windows

</PRE>ACME Setup did not complete.
Likely cause is insufficient disk
space on drive containing the
<PRE>Windows directory.                      The application's setup program did
                                        not complete. No indication of what
                                        caused this failure was reported by
                                        the setup program. One likely cause
                                        is insufficient space on the drive
                                        containing the Windows directory.

</PRE>Cannot access SETUP.EXE on
<PRE>application server.                     The setup program on the package
                                        distribution server cannot be
                                        accessed. Check the directory
                                        permissions.
ACME Setup failed to start.             The setup program failed to start,
                                        probably due to insufficient
                                        memory.
Cannot open local STF file.             After setup has succeeded, a
                                        SETUP.STF file is installed in the
                                        application's directory on the
                                        client. SMSSETUP has detected that
                                        this file is missing.
Corrupted STF file.                     SMSSETUP found something corrupted
                                        in the STF file.

</PRE><P><LI>Installing Applications on Clients
<P>
</OL>When you use a PDF to create a job to install an application on
workstations with a Run Command on Workstation job, you must copy the
appropriate SMSPROXY directory to the package source directory before
distributing the package to workstations. You can find the SMSPROXY
directory in the PRIMSITE.SRC\IMPORT.SRC\appName directory. Copying the
SMSPROXY directory to the package source directory is required for both
Share Package on Server and Run Command on Workstation jobs.
<P>
If a computer is running a shared copy of an application and you want to
install a local copy of that application on that computer using a PDF, you
must first remove the shared copy of the application. The deinstall program
for a shared application is located in a subdirectory of the SMSPROXY
directory. For example, the deinstallation program for Microsoft Word is
MS\SMS\SMSPROXY\WINWORD\DEINSTAL.EXE.

<OL><P><LI>Notes on Installing Specific Applications
</OL>Microsoft Office When you create the admin installation for Microsoft
Office version 4.2c or 4.3c, you may see a message stating "Setup cannot
update the Proofing Tools in the shared location because the lex formats
are incompatible." If you see this message, you can ignore it and continue
with the installation. All components of Microsoft Office will work
correctly.
<P>
Do not remove any program items from a Microsoft Office program group,
either before or after the package has been distributed. For example, don't
remove the PowerPoint program item from the Office program group.
Otherwise, OLE functions and Registry entries will not work properly.
<P>
If you set up Microsoft Office version 4.3 or Microsoft® Access® version
2.0 as shared applications, the package source directory for the
application allows users both Read and Write permissions. This allows users
to have the necessary write access to the Microsoft Access file
ACS200\WORKDIR\SYSTEM.MDA. These access permissions are set in the
ACS200.PDF and OFP43_.PDF files. To protect other files in the package
directory from being modified by clients, set the permissions to read-only
on each distribution server after the package has been distributed. For
further information, see the Microsoft Access README file.
<P>
When you set up Microsoft Office as a shared application, clients
configured to use the shared copy of Microsoft Office cannot be configured
to use separate shared copies of any of the Office applications. Do not
assign a group the rights to use both a shared version of Microsoft Office,
and shared copies of any of the following individual applications:
Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, and Microsoft
Access.
<P>
When you set up Microsoft Office as a shared application, you must set the
program items for the MSAPPS applets within the Office package (such as
Graph AutoConvert and Microsoft Query) to use the same Drive Mode as the
MSAPPS package. For example, if the Microsoft Query program item in the
MSAPPS package has Drive Mode: Runs With UNC Name, then the Microsoft Query
program item in the Office package must also use the Drive Mode: Runs With
UNC Name setting. Note that if you choose to use a specified drive, you can
specify different drives for the corresponding program items in the Office
package and the MSAPPS package.
<P>
Microsoft Word
When you set up Microsoft Word version 6.0 as a shared application, it may
produce an error when users of clients running Windows NT version 3.1 exit
the application. This does not happen on other types of clients.
<P>
Microsoft Access
If you set up Microsoft Office version 4.3 or Microsoft Access version 2.0
as shared applications, the package source directory for the application
allows users both Read and Write permissions. This allows users to have the
necessary write access to the Microsoft Access file
ACS200\WORKDIR\SYSTEM.MDA. These access permissions are set in the
ACS200.PDF and OFP43_.PDF files. To protect other files in the package
directory from being modified by clients, set the permissions to read-only
on each distribution server after the package has been distributed. For
further information, see the Microsoft Access README file.
<P>
Microsoft Works
When you use SMS to install Microsoft Works on a server as a shared
application, users will not be able to access the Works tutorial.

<OL><P><LI>Using SMS to Install Operating Systems on Clients
</OL>When using SMS to installing Windows NT on a client previously running MS-
DOS, Windows, or Windows for Workgroups, you should take the following
steps:
<PRE>   a) Copy the UNATTEND.SCR file from the LOGON.SRV\MSTEST directory to the
</PRE></OL>package source directory.
<PRE>   b) Edit the UNATTEND.SCR file to make changes as needed for unattended
</PRE>installation of the operating system.
<PRE>   c) If the target clients run just MS-DOS, and not Windows or Windows for
</PRE>Workgroups, you must also copy the DOSNTUPG.EXE, NAMECHGR.EXE, and
AIDDOSNT.BAT files from LOGON.SRV\MSTEST to the package source directory.
<P>
Use the Windows NT Server Manager to add the computer name of the computer
on which Windows NT is being installed to the domain.
<P>
You can upgrade a group of computers from MS-DOS, Windows, or Windows for
Workgroups to Windows NT with a single job. When you do so, all computers
being upgraded will use a single UNATTEND.SCR file. UNATTEND.SCR includes
data about the operating system and network card type and card parameters,
so if you want the setup to be automated, then each job must target only
computers with identical operating systems and network card setup data. You
can query the SMS computer database to find computers with identical
configurations. Computers targeted by a single upgrade job must also all
join the same domain or workgroup, as this is specified in UNATTEND.SCR as
well.
<P>
The default UNATTEND.SCR file documents the settings you need to make in
this file. Examine it if you want more information. It is in the
LOGON.SRV\MSTEST directory.
<P>
You cannot use an automated setup to upgrade a NetWare client to Windows
for Workgroups. These upgrades must be done as manual setups.
<P>
On TCP/IP networks, when performing an automated upgrade of a client to
Windows NT version 3.5 from a previous version of Windows NT, you must
specify an upgrade script. Do this by modifying the command line for the
"Automated Upgrade for (all platforms) NT Client."  In this command line,
specify the upgrade script by adding a colon and the name of the script to
the /U option at the end of the command line. The following is an example
of the command line after you make these changes:
<PRE>   NTENCAP /NTW WINNT32.EXE /U:NTUPGRAD.SCR

</PRE>The upgrade script you specify must include the !UpgradeEnableDhcp setting,
with either yes or no as the value. This setting indicates whether this
client will have its TCP/IP address dynamically allocated by DHCP. The
NTUPGRAD.SCR file in the LOGON.SRV\MSTEST is an example script file you can
use for this.

<OL><P><LI>Remote Troubleshooting Utilities
</OL>The Remote Chat utility is not included in this version of SMS.
<P>
For remote troubleshooting of NetWare clients using IPX/SPX and running
Windows 3.x, the client
must have the following files:
NWNETAPI.DLL
NWCALLS.DLL
NWIPXSPX.DLL
<P>
These files are normally provided with your NetWare client software. They
are also available from Novell or public forums such as CompuServe.
<P>
Without these files, NetWare clients running Windows 3.x will display the
following message when the user starts Remote Control from the SMS Client
program group:
"Remote Control Agent cannot load idis_ipx.dll."
<P>
If you see this message, you must ensure that the listed files are
installed on the client. Note that NetWare clients running only MS-DOS do
not require these three files.
<P>
Note that NWCALLS.DLL and NWIPXSPX.DLL are normally installed on a NetWare
client running Windows 3.x. Most likely, the NWNETAPI.DLL will be missing
from the client.
<P>
You can easily use SMS to install the NWNETAPI.DLL file on NetWare clients.
Simply place the the file in the SITE.SRV\MAINCFG.BOX\CLIENT.SRC\X86.BIN
directory on the site server. The Maintenance Manager will replicate the
file to all NetWare logon servers. The file will be installed to the
MS\SMS\BIN directory of all NetWare clients when users run the Client Setup
program (either manually or through their login script).
<P>
When mapping TCP/IP addresses in the LMHOSTS file so that you can use
remote troubleshooting utilities on clients over TCP/IP WAN links, the
following syntax is correct.
<P>
On the server, each line should start with a client's IP address, followed
by a space and a double-quotation mark. Immediately after the quotation
mark should be the the client's computer name. The 16th character after the
start of the client's computer name should be "C" to enable
remote control, or "E" to enable File Transfer. Follow the C or E with
another quotation mark. Following is an example to enable remote control of
a client.
<P>
<PRE>11.103.38.100  "myclient       C"

</PRE></OL>On the client, each line should start with a server's IP address, followed
by a space and a double-quotation mark. Immediately after the quotation
mark should be the the server's computer name. The 16th character after the
start of the server's computer name should be "D" to enable
remote control, or an "F" to enable File Transfer. Follow the D or F with
another quotation mark.
<P>
These instructions replace the instructions on page 393 of the Microsoft
Systems Management Server
Administrator's Guide.
<P>
For remote troubleshooting of Windows for Workgroups clients using the
TCP/IP protocol, the client must be running the Microsoft TCP/IP-32 version
of TCP/IP. Previous versions of TCP/IP shipped with Windows for Workgroups
are not supported by SMS for remote troubleshooting.
<P>
For remote troubleshooting of clients running MS-DOS that use LAN Manager
version 2.2c client software and the TCP/IP protocol, the client must be
running the latest version of the TCP/IP protocol, provided with LAN
Manager version 2.2c. Previous versions of TCP/IP shipped with
previous versions of LAN Manager are not supported by SMS for remote
troubleshooting.
<P>
If you reconfigure a client, changing the Lana number of the protocol used
for Remote Control and other remote troubleshooting utilities on the
client, you must specify the new Lana number the
next time the client runs WUSER. For example, if the client previously used
Lana number 2 for Remote Control, and you reconfigure the client so that
the protocol previously represented by Lana
number 2 is Lana number 1, you should specify wuser /l1 the next time you
start WUSER. Otherwise, you will see the error message "Unable to get
workstation name. Used Lana:2"
<P>
When you are using Remote Control on a client, while in the Quick Viewer
window you may start seeing that the keys you press are preceded with a ^
on screen. (For example, if you press the "k" key a "^K" appears in the
Quick Viewer screen.) This also prevents the ENTER key from working in the
Quick Viewer window. To correct this problem, press the CTRL key once. You
can prevent this problem from happening by not using CTRL+ESC to use the
Task List while you have a Quick Viewer window open.

</PRE></OL>Technical Notes
The Windows NT Driver Library is provided on the Windows NT CD-ROM in the
DRVLIB directory, as well as several locations for electronic transmission.
<P>
Please see the section at the end of this document for instructions on
downloading and accessing Windows NT Driver Library drivers.
<P>
Network Monitor can be used on Windows NT Server or Windows NT Workstation
version 3.1 (Service Pack 2 applied) to trace an established RAS
conversation. Once the Microsoft Remote Access Service
(RAS) is loaded on a computer running Windows NT Server version 3.1, typing
net config rdr from the MS-DOS prompt will show RAS bindings, depending on
what protocols are loaded.  For example, if NetBEUI is loaded and the RAS
server is set for Dial in and Out, and there is only one computer
running Windows NT version 3.1, the RAS binding could look like:
<P>
nbf_RasHub04 (524153480001).
<P>
Note what this "RasHub" binding is, because it will have to be added
manually in the Windows NT Registry before you can use Network Monitor to
capture over a RAS connection.
<P>
The following example lists linkages to add for the above RasHub04 example
to an 3Com Etherlink II network card.
<P>
Under:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
<P>
Key Name:
SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\BH\Linkages
<P>
Double-click the existing lines, position the cursor after the existing
path, and press ENTER so that you are positioned on the next line down (do
not overwrite what is there already).
<P>
Bind:
\Device\ELNK31
\Device\RasHub04
<P>
Export:
\Device\bh_ELNK31
\Device\bh_RasHub04
<P>
Route:
"ELNK3" "ELNK31"
"RasHub"  "RasHub04"
<P>
When you restart Network Monitor, and then choose the Networks option from
the Capture menu, an additional Local Network option appears in the Select
Capture Network dialog box. The Current Address listing for this option
matches the number that is displayed when you run the NET CONFIG RDR
command from the MS-DOS prompt. This is the network to select to trace the
established RAS connection.
<P>
For Windows for Workgroups Clients
In PROTOCOL.INI under the [NETMON] section, any current entry in the
Bindings section should be replaced by the ASYMAC driver/label.
<P>
For example, for a 3Com Etherlink II, to change the Network Monitor binding
from Etherlink II to the RAS connection, the Bindings entry in PROTOCOL.INI
should be modified as follows:
<P>
Bindings=MS$ELNKII
should be changed to:
Bindings=ASYMAC

Running Network Monitor on Token Ring Networks
When capturing on token ring networks, the network adapter card on the
computer running Network Monitor may need to have a maximum frame size set
to the largest possible token ring frame (17K). Otherwise, frames exceeding
this maximum size will be rejected by the network adapter card because
the frame will not fit into the card's receive buffers.
<P>
For example, the NetFlexTM network adapter card has a default maximum frame
size of 4500 bytes and will drop any frame that exceeds this size. To a
<PRE>void losing frames, if your network supports frames of up to 17K, the
</PRE>maximum frame size of your network adapter card should be increased to
this size.
<P>
If you install Network Monitor independent of SMS setup, and your are
connected to a token ring network, you may need to copy a new NDIS.SYS
file. This file can be found in the WFW\DISK1\DRVR.NT directory on the SMS
CD-ROM. Using a new version of this file enables token ring network adapter
cards to reset properly after experiencing a Ring Error while capturing.
Failure to use the correct driver can cause the system to hang.
<P>
Note that modifying the network adapter card's maximum frame size setting
decreases the number of receive buffers available, and on a busy network,
frames may be dropped due to a lack of receive buffers. If your network
adapter card supports increasing the number of receive buffers, do this to
minimize the number of frames that are dropped because of increased buffer
size.
<P>
The File Open and File Save dialog boxes allow you to associate comments
with a capture file or to display such comments. If a UNC path (for example
\\MYCOMP\MYFILE) is displayed in these dialog boxes, an installation of
Network Monitor running on a Windows for Workgroups computer will not
display comments associated with the displayed filename. If you display the
drive letter associated with the UNC path, the comments are available. In
addition, on computers running Windows NT, the comments are displayed.
<P>
On some Windows for Workgroups systems, because of memory resources used by
Network Monitor, you may encounter problems running Network Monitor and
other Windows applications at the same time. Therefore, you should always
close all other Windows applications before running Network Monitor on a
client running Windows for Workgroups.
<P>
In addition, after using Network Monitor to capture on a computer running
Windows for Workgroups, you may be unable to open other Windows
applications. To remedy this, save the current capture, and then exit
Network Monitor.
<P>
Running Network Monitor on Clients Running Windows for Workgroups The beta
3 release of Network Monitor used 3-character names to identify TCP flags
in the Summary pane. In the released product, these 3-character names have
been replaced by the first character in the flag name. The following table
shows how the three character names map to the one-character names used in
the released product:
<P>
<PRE>Flag                    Which was               Is now
Urgent                  URG                     U
Acknowledgment  ACK                     A
Push                    PSH                     P

Synchronize             SYN                     S
Final                   FIN                     F

</PRE>Make sure that all adapter memory is excluded when using EMM386 on a
Windows for Workgroups system. Failure to exclude this memory or other
misconfigurations may cause Windows for Workgroups to hang. See the MS-DOS
documentation on how to configure your EMM386 correctly.
<P>
While two network interface cards cannot be used for capturing in a Windows
for Workgroups system, you can alter which card is used for capturing. To
change which card will be used for capturing, alter the BINDINGS= line in
the [NETMON] section of the PROTOCOL.INI file to reflect the card to which
you want Network Monitor to bind.

</OL>In Windows NT and LAN Manager domains, the Automatically Configure
Workstation Logon Scripts option modifies only the logon scripts for user
accounts that have no existing logon script or have a logon script with a
file extension. For example, if a user has a logon script specified as
USER.BAT, the Site Configuration Manager will modify the script to include
the SMSLS batch file. If a user has logon script as USER (instead of
USER.BAT), Site Configuration Manager will not modify the script. If you
want to set up a user account so that the SMSLS batch file is not added to
it, you can specify a logon script with no extension for that user.

<OL><P><LI>Miscellaneous Notes
</OL>SMS requires that site servers run the final release of version 3.5 of
Microsoft Windows NT Server. Also, SMS databases must be on servers running
Windows NT 3.5 and Microsoft SQL Server 4.21A.
<P>
Do not put custom files in the SITE.SRV\platform.BIN directory (such as the
SITE.SRV\X86.BIN directory). This directory is purged every time the SMS
software is upgraded.
<P>
Upgrades of the SMS software on client computers will fail if any SMS
software is running at the time of upgrade. If you put any SMS icons (such
as WUSER.EXE) in a client's Startup group, you must stop these programs
before upgrading the client.
<P>
For clients with dual-boot systems, you must choose one of the operating
systems on which to run SMS. SMS does not support the installation of SMS
on both operating systems so that the user can switch back and forth
repeatedly. This is because SMS must know which operating system is run by
each client computer, so that the correct jobs can be sent to each client.
If you have SMS installed on a dual-boot computer and want to change which
operating system is supported by SMS, run UPGRADE.BAT on the operating
system you want to switch to.

directory should actually be PRIMSITE.SRV\AUDIT\PACKAGE.
<P>
The instructions for modifying the LMHOSTS file (page 393) to enable the
use of remote troubleshooting utilities on clients over TCP/IP WAN links
are incorrect. The correct instructions are as follows:
<P>
On the server, each line should start with a client's IP address, followed
by the client's computer name. The 16th character after the start of the
client's computer name should be "C" to enable remote control, or E to
enable File Transfer.
<P>
On the client, each line should start with a server's IP address, followed
by the server's computer name. The 16th character after the start of the
server's computer name should be "D" to enable remote control, or F to
enable File Transfer.
<P>
Pages 415-423 mention a Remote Chat utility. This utility is not included
in this release of SMS.
<P>
On page 557, the text incorrectly states that Client Setup may modify the
TimeCriticalSection setting in SYSTEM.INI. Actually, Client Setup never
modifies this value.
<P>
On page 580, the text states that "On NetWare servers, the package

<OL><P><LI>Using SMS with Other Language Versions of Windows NT
</OL>If you have a site that contains a site server or logon servers that use a
non-English language version of Windows NT Server, you must create the
following user groups in the domains that contain those servers:
1) Create an Administrators local group and add all members of the
Administrators local group for the language for the non-English domain (for
example, Administratoren for the German version of
Windows NT Server) to the Administrators local group that you created.
2) Create a Guests local group and add all members of the Guests local
group for the language for the non-English domain (for example, Gäste for
the German version of Windows NT Server) to the Guests local group that you
created.
3) Create a Users local group and add all members of the Users local group
for the language for the non-English domain (for example, Benützer for the
German version of Windows NT Server) to the Users local group that you
created.
4) Create an Everyone local group, add all members of the Users local group
for the language for the non-English domain (for example, Benützer for the
German version of Windows NT Server) to the Everyone local group that you
created, and then add the Domain Guests for the language for the
non-English domain (for example, Domänen Gäste for the German version of
Windows NT Server).
<P>
Note that the Site Configuration Manager uses the Administrators, Guests,
Users, and Everyone groups to set permissions on the site server and logon
servers. The Despooler also uses these groups to set permissions on the
package shares for package distribution servers. Note that if the
Despooler cannot set permissions for these groups, it will not install the
files for the package.
