The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Appendix G of the Systems Management Server Administrators Guide discusses
the customizing of computer inventory and the method to deliver
the custom MIF forms to the Systems Management Server clients. This article
outlines an alternate method to achieve this. The alternate method has the
additional benefit of automatically downloading the new forms for all new
clients when added to the Systems Management Server site.
<P>
NOTE: If you run Systems Management Server Setup and add components or
upgrade your site after you following the procedure below, the files you
modified (CLI_*.TXT) will be replaced with the original versions.
Therefore, this method is not supported by Microsoft for Systems Management
Server version 1.0. If you decide to use the method below, Microsoft
recommends that you make backup copies of the CLI_*.TXT files you modify.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The steps described below are similar to the documented method in the
Systems Management Server Administrators guide. The main difference is
the modification of the CL_*.txt file (where * indicates the client
operating system). The change specifies which files should be downloaded to
the client computers. You should specify the new forms you have created in
this file.
<P>
The remainder of this article will reference the CLI_WIN.TXT for purposes
of demonstration. If you are using other client operating systems with
Systems Management Server, follow the steps below to modify the appropriate
copylist file for each operating system platform.

<OL><P><LI>Create the new form.
<P>
   Follow the steps outlined in Appendix G for Customizing the Computer
   Inventory and Creating forms. Save the new forms in the
   \SITE.SRV\MAINCFG.BOX\CLIENT.SRC\&lt;platform&gt; (where &lt;platform&gt;
   is all platforms currently installed  [for example, X86.BIN]). Forms
   saved in this location will automatically be copied to the logon
   servers.
<P>
   NOTE: All forms should be saved with the .XNF filename extension.

<P><LI>Modify CL_WIN.TXT.
<P>
   Modify the \SITE.SRV\MAINCFG.BOX\CLIENT.SRC\CL_WIN.TXT file to include
   the new form(s) you have created. You can add the appropriate lines to
   this file in one of several locations. However, Microsoft recommends
   you add the lines in the STANDARD NETWORK FILES section. This file will
   automatically be replicated to all logon servers.

<P><LI>Create a package to update clients.
<P>
   Write a batch file to connect to the \SMS_SHR share on a logon server
   and run CLI_DOS.EXE /U from the appropriate platform subdirectory.
   This will prepare the client to be updated at the next logon and the
   specified XNF files to be downloaded to the client where they will
   be available to the MIF Entry utility.
<P>
   Sample batch file:
<P>
<P><PRE>     C:
     net use t: \\smsserver\sms_shr
     t:
     cd x86.bin
     cli_dos /u
     c:
     net use t: /d
</PRE>
<P><LI>Distribute CLI_WIN.TXT to clients.
<P>
   Deliver the above batch file to the client machines where the new forms
   should be available. When the job is executed on the client, the above
   batch file will prepare the client for update at the next logon. This
   file will also be delivered to all new Systems Management Server clients
   and will result in the automatic installation of the desired XNF forms.
