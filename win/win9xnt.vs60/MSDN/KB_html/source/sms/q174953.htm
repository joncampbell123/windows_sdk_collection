The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 Service Pack 3
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In an effort to reduce the amount of network traffic and time required to
run the Systems Management Server logon scripts, Smsls.bat and Runsms.bat,
the initial Systems Management Server client installation now installs many
of the files that were previously located on the Systems Management Server
logon server to the Systems Management Server client's local hard drive.
<P>
After the Systems Management Server client is installed, subsequently
running the Systems Management Server script results in much lower network
traffic between the client and the Systems Management Server logon server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following are examples of the approximate drive space consumed by a
Systems Management Server 1.2 client without Service Pack 3 installed:

<UL><LI>Windows 95: 2.7 MB

<LI>Windows NT: 2.9 MB
<P>
</UL>The following are the drive space requirements after Systems Management
Server 1.2 Service Pack 3 is installed:

<UL><LI>Windows 95: 3.8 MB

<LI>Windows NT: 3.2 MB
<P>
</UL>By moving many files to the client, the number of bytes transferred between
a Windows 95 client and a Systems Management Server logon server has been
reduced by approximately 75 percent. Additionally, client computers running
Windows NT will see almost a 50 percent reduction in network traffic
between client and server.
