The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The SETLS program is run from the Smsls.bat and Smsls.cmd files. The
Smsls.ini file is used by SETLS to determine which domain to add the
current workstation to.
<P>
The Smsls.ini file enables the administrator to map computers to a specific
domain, regardless of which domain the computer actually logs on to. The
Smsls.ini file is used to provide additional control over what domain and
server the setup and inventory programs are run from.
<P>
NOTE: Systems Management Server allows the creation of Systems Management
Server domain names that may or may not correspond to Windows NT domains.
When mapping computers to specific domains, actual Windows NT domain names
must be used.
<P>
The following sections are available for use in the Smsls.ini file:
<P>
[WIN.INI]
This section enables workstations running Windows to use the domain
specified by the [SMS] section of the workstation's Win.ini file. The
[WIN.INI] section of the Smsls.ini file requires no entries. To set the
workstation's Systems Management Server domain, the administrator creates
an [SMS] section in the Win.ini file (at the workstation running Windows),
and adds the domain entry to that section.
<P>
[other domain]
This section enables workstations running Enhanced LAN Manager 2.x to use
the domains in the OTHDOMAINS entry of the WORKSTATION section of the
workstation's Lanman.ini file to map to a Systems Management Server domain.
The SETLS program tries to map a domain in the OTHDOMAINS entry starting
with the first domain in the OTHDOMAINS entry. In the Smsls.ini file, you
add the [OTHER DOMAIN] section with entries that map the domain entries for
the OTHDOMAINS in the Lanman.ini file of the workstation to Systems
Management Server domains.
<P>
[workgroup]
This section enables workstations running Windows NT, Windows for
Workgroups, Windows95, or MS-DOS Workgroup Connection to map the workgroup
set on the workstation to a Systems Management Server domain. This section
also allows Windows NT clients that are members of a Windows NT resource
domain to be mapped to that domain in the Systems Management Server
hierarchy.
<P>
[domain]
This section enables workstations running Windows NT, Windows for
Workgroups, MS-DOS Workgroup Connection, or Enhanced LAN Manager 2.x to map
the domain where the workstation user is currently logged on to a Systems
Management Server domain.
<P>
[machine]
This section enables workstations running Windows NT, Windows for
Workgroups, MS-DOS Workgroup Connection, or Enhanced LAN Manager 2.x to map
individual computers to a Systems Management Server domain.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are several methods available for mapping domains, and any number or
combination of the methods may be used. The Smsls.ini file will be searched
sequentially from top to bottom. The first method that provides a server
will be used; then the search stops. The administrator may organize the
sections to set the desired priorities.
<P>
SETLS will get the information for the current computer that corresponds to
the section being examined (for example, the machine name and workgroup
information). SETLS compares the current value to the entries in that
section. When a match is found, the domain on the right-hand side of the
equal sign ("=") is used.
<P>
The following examples show different entries in the Smsls.ini file:

<UL><LI>To Map a Domain to a Logon Server:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [DOMAIN]
      PSUEDOMAIN=\\SMS1
</PRE><P>
   The server name must be preceded by a double backslash (\\). In this
   example, workstations that have logged into PSUEDOMAIN are mapped to the
   server SMS1.

<LI>To Map Individual Computers to a Domain:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [MACHINE]
      TIM1=PSUEDOMAIN
      BRIANL3=PSUEDOMAIN
</PRE><P>
   In this example, the computers TIM1 and BRIANL3 are mapped to the
   PSUEDOMAIN domain.

<LI>To Map One Domain to Another Domain:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [DOMAIN]
      CSUEWEST=PSUEDOMAIN
      CSUEEAST=PSUEDOMAIN
</PRE><P>
   In this example, users logging on to the CSUEWEST and CSUEEAST domains
   will be mapped to the PSUEDOMAIN.

<LI>To Map a Lan Manager Domain to a Windows NT domain:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [OTHER DOMAIN]
      CSUESOUTH=PSUEDOMAIN
</PRE><P>
   In this example, computers in the CSUESOUTH domain are mapped to the
   PSUEDOMAIN domain.
<P>
</UL><h3>Systems Management Server 1.2 Enhancements</h3>
 
<P>
In Systems Management Server version 1.2, additional functionality was
added to support mapping a client to a Systems Management Server domain and
site combination, or to a specific logon server. There are three additional
types of mapping available in each section.

<UL><LI>To Map a Workgroup to a Domain:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [WORKGROUP]
      CSUETEST=CSUECORP
      CSUDEV=CSUECORP
</PRE><P>
   In this example, the computers running Windows in the CSETEST and CSUDEV
   workgroups are mapped to the CSUECORP domain, and Windows NT clients
   whose machine accounts are in the CSETEST and CSUDEV domains will be
   mapped to the CSUECORP domain.

<LI>To Map a Computer to a Logon Server:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [MACHINE]
      CL7=\\SERVER1
</PRE><P>
   In this example, the client CL7 is mapped to the server SERVER1.

<LI>To Map a Domain to a Site:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [DOMAIN]
      WESTERN=CORP:S01
</PRE><P>
   In this example, clients in the WESTERN domain are mapped to the CORP
   domain's site S01.
<P>
</UL>These enhancements now allow logon scripts to be used where there are
multiple sites within a single Windows NT domain. In addition, a client can
be mapped directly to a specified server. This allows the administrator to
specify which Systems Management Server logon server will be used in
domains where there are multiple domain controllers.
<P>

Sites in the Administrator's Guide.
