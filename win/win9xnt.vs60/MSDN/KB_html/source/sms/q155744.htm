The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When the SMS site server and the remotely controlled computer are using
separate primary WINS servers, the SMS Administrator cannot locate the
client for remote control using TCP/IP (until the WINS database is
replicated to its partner). Once the WINS replication occurs, remote
control functions normally. This problem does not occur if the SMS site
server and client computer reside on the same network segment.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the remote agent is loaded on a TCP/IP client, the &lt;43&gt; extension of
the client NetBIOS name is registered on the client. It is viewable by
typing “nbtstat -n” (without quotation marks) at the command prompt on the
client. This registration is picked up by the client's WINS server and is
viewable in WINS Manager. On the appropriate interval, the &lt;43&gt; extension
registration is replicated to any of the WINS replication partners.
<P>
If you attempt a remote control session prior to the WINS replication, the
server running SMS Administrator cannot resolve the &lt;43&gt; extension of the
client name.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Configure the Site Server (or server running the SMS Tools) to use the
   same primary WINS server
<P>
 -or-

<LI>Keep the remote agent loaded on all computers all the time (once the
   extension is registered and replicated the first time, no delay occurs)
   Keep in mind that the extension can be removed from WINS by rebooting
   or unloading the remote agent.
<P>
 -or-

<LI>Use the LMHOSTS file on the server. For more information, please see the
   following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : How to Use Remote Control with TCP/IP

</PRE><LI>Upgrade to Systems Management Server version 1.2, and set the default
   protocol to TCP/IP. For more information, please see the Systems
   Management Server 1.2 Administrator's Guide, Chapter 10, "Configuring
   Default Protocol Settings for Clients". Doing this allows remote
   sessions to use sockets, avoiding NetBIOS name resolution for the
   remote agent. This configuration is supported for Windows 95, Windows NT
   3.51, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows for Workgroups (using MSTCPIP-32)
   client computers.
