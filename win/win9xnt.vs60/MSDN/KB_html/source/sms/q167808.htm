The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
NetWare logon servers in a Systems Management Server site may go inactive
or fail to be installed, even though the Systems Management Server service
account has adequate permissions, there is plenty of free space on the
specified NetWare volume, and network connectivity is available. This will
result in inventory from clients not being reported up to the site server,
packages not being distributed, and other problems normally associated with
account permissions, disk space, or connectivity problems.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Site Server's Site Configuration Manager (SCMAN) may not be able to
correctly enumerate the volume name specified in order to verify or install
the Systems Management Server logon server components. This is caused by a
problem with the NetWare 3.1x logon server's bindery.
<P>
Viewing the Scman.log file from the Site Server reveals that it is able to
locate and identify the server, but is unable to enumerate the volume name
specified for Systems Management Server installation or verification.
<P>
In the following log excerpt, the number of shares (volumes) reported is
incorrect (note that the number reported may also be 0):
<P>
<PRE>   Server SERVER1 has 171 shares
   Server SERVER1 status Pending Install role 0x12
   Server SERVER1 has 11 inboxes; 0 domain master inboxes; 0 components

</PRE>Site Configuration Manager attempts to identify the volume (VOL1) specified
in the site properties, but is unable to locate it, as reflected in this
portion of the Scman.log file:
<P>
<PRE>   Checking for share SMS and directory \\SERVER1\VOL1\SMS\logon.srv on
   SERVER1; no share

</PRE>Directory creation is attempted, but it fails:
<P>
<PRE>   CSharedDirInstallItem::Install share=, vol=, dir=SMS\logon.srv,
   subDiraccess=3, share access=2
   Created directory \\SERVER1\VOL1\SMS\logon.srv
   share not found, cannot create without share path

</PRE>An event 223 is logged:
<P>
<PRE>   Event 223 logged with error 183 and object (SERVER1); GetLastError 183;
   SiteConfig Mgr code 7404.
   Cannot create inboxes (Application Control Database, Application Control
   INI, Application Control Script, Client Installation, Despooler,
   Inventory Agent, Inventory Processor, ISV MIF Collection, MS Test,
   Package Command Instruction, Package Source) on server SERVER1

</PRE>The logon server remains inactive.
<P>
Another way to test for this condition is to browse the volume list of a
Netware 3.1x server from an computer running Windows NT Server (for
example, the site server) running Gateway (Client) Services for NetWare. If
the volume requested by Site Configuration Manager is not visible in the
browse list, SCMAN will not be able to create the directories on the
volume, even though it has adequate permissions and connectivity and the
volume has enough free space. Note that client computers running MS-DOS,
Windows 3.x, or Windows 95 do not experience this problem.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, run the NetWare server BINDFIX utility. For more
information on this utility, consult the documentation provided with your
Novell NetWare product.
