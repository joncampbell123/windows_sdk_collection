The information in this article applies to:

</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Because Microsoft Systems Management Server is based on a
sophisticated set of transactions that are processed throughout the site
hierarchy, it is often difficult to predict the time in which a command
will complete. These commands can range from a package distribution to a
logon server configuration update. Systems Management Server builds in to
each Windows NT service component the ability to write status and
diagnostic information to log files for historical or interactive review.
There are also several client-side log files created by Program Group
Control, AppStart, and so on.
<P>
It is strongly recommended that tracing remain active; however, for
performance tuning, you may disable trace logging with Systems Management
Server Service Manager, and activate tracing during diagnostics and
setup/upgrade. This feature is on by default so that any recent problems
will be recorded.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Along with the ability to write log information to a file, Systems
Management Server includes the Server Service Manager (SMSVCMGR.EXE) and
Trace (SMSTRACE.EXE) that you can use to control and display and review
these diagnostic log files.
<P>
By default, tracing (the process of writing to the log files) will be
enabled for the Windows NT service components of Systems Management Server
but can easily be deactivated (for performance improvements) with the SMS
Service Manager. Once activated for a particular component, you can use SMS
Trace (run from SITE.SRV\&lt;ARCHITECTURE&gt;.BIN\SMSTRACE.EXE) to open the log
file and monitor it in real time.
<P>
Log files are located in the SMS\LOGS directory by default. You can use
Systems Management Server Service Manager to set log file locations and
maximum sizes. Following is a list of Systems Management Server components
and the relevant log files:
<P>
<PRE>Site Configuration Manager:   SCMAN.LOG
Hierarchy Manager:            HMAN.LOG
Inventory Agent NT:           INVAGENT.LOG
PCM Service:                  PACMAN.LOG
SMS_Executive:                SMSEXEC.LOG
Alerter:                      ALERTER.LOG
Applications Manager:         APPMAN.LOG
Inventory Data Loader:        DATALODR.LOG
Despooler:                    DESPOOL.LOG
Inventory Processor:          INVPROC.LOG
Senders:                      LANSEND.LOG, RASASYNC.LOG, and so on
Maintenance Manager:          MAINTMAN.LOG
Job Scheduler:                SCHED.LOG
Site Reporter:                SITEREPT.LOG
Package Command Manager:      No log file used; see note below.
Program Group Controller:     &lt;WINROOT&gt;\SMSLOG.TXT
AppStart:                     &lt;WINROOT&gt;\SMSLOG.TXT

</PRE>Information included in a log file usually includes the time of day, error
codes, a description, and identification of the component and thread ID.
Because of the specialization of each component, each log file contains
slightly different text. If you need to see what is happening with a
particular task, and there is insufficient information reported by Systems
Management Server Administrator, you can check the log files to see how
things are progressing.
<P>
NOTE: The Package Command Manager does not use a log file; instead, it can
be run with a /debug switch that causes PCM to write diagnostic information
to a special window up to a maximum of 64 kilobytes (K).
