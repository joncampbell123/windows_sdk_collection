The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, version 1.2 Service Pack 1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After applying Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 1, client
inventory that previously functioned correctly while running Smsls or
Runsms.bat may stop responding at three to four percent during client
inventory. A verbose output of the inventory agent shows different
messages, based on the type of client.
<P>
Client computers running Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups, or Windows 95
running the Smsls.scr logon script from a NetWare logon server will see the
following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Found Path to SMS.INI
   Found Path to DOMAIN.INI
   Cannot find \\&lt;Netware Logon Server&gt;\SYS\SMS\LOGON.SRV\DOMAIN.INI
   Inventory cannot be taken

</PRE>A client computer running Windows for Workgroups logging into a Windows NT
Server domain will see the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Found path to domain.ini

</PRE>The client may also experience the following error immediately after the
message:
<P>
<PRE>   An unexpected network error has occurred.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The client is looking for the Domain.ini file on a randomly selected
server, rather than the current server.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, replace the Initmain.exe file from Systems
Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 1 with the version on the Systems
Management Sever 1.2 compact disc, by copying it to the following
directory:
<P>
<PRE>   Sms\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\X86.bin

</PRE>The file will be automatically copied to the logon servers'
Sms\Logon.srv\X86.bin directory during the next watchdog cycle. To speed
up the process, you can manually copy the file to the Sms\Logon.srv\X86.bin
directory on all Systems Management Server logon servers.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2 Service Pack 1.
A supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
