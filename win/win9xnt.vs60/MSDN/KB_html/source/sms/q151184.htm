The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
After you install Systems Management Server in your network, you may find
that you don't want your remote clients to be inventoried when they log on
remotely over a slow speed dial-up connection because of the additional
time it will take.
<P>
Listed below is a checklist and discussion of the utilities involved in
customizing the Systems Management Server environment so that
Smsls.bat/.cmd will not be executed over a slow network link such as a dial-
up line.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Configuring the Site Server Properties</h3>
 
<P>
To configure your SMS site server not to collect inventory over a slow
link, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>In the Site Properties window in the SMS Administrator utility, click
   the Inventory button.

<P><LI>Select Proposed Properties, and select either "Prompt Workstation Users"
   or "Don't Take Inventory."

<P><LI>Keep choosing OK until you are back to the Sites window. Remember, site
</OL>property changes take a few minutes to be processed, and longer in cases
where a child site's properties are being changed.
<P>
As a result of this change in the site properties, the SMS
Maintenance Manager service will generate a new Netspeed.com. If SMS is
configured so that your login scripts are automatically configured, the new
Netspeed.com will eventually be copied or replicated to your logon servers.
<P>
However, if SMS is not configured to modify your login scripts, you will
need to copy the updated Netspeed.com to your logon server(s). The new
version of Netspeed.com is located on your site server in the
\Sms\Site.Srv\Maincfg.Box\Client.src directory.
<P>
If you use the Directory Replicator service to copy your login scripts
between your logon servers, copy the new Netspeed.com to the source
directory of your export server, normally the primary domain controller of
the logon domain. If this service is not used, copy the file to the
Netlogon share of all your logon servers, the same directory where
Smsls.bat/.cmd is being executed from.
<P>
NOTE: For more information on configuring SMS to automatically update your
login scripts, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

   TITLE     : Checklist for Enabling SMS in Logon Scripts

</PRE></OL><h3>Adjusting the Threshold Speed</h3>
 
<P>
Depending on the actual speed of the remote connection, you may find it
necessary to adjust the cutoff value where Netspeed.com determines that the
connection is slow.
<P>
For more information on adjusting this threshold value, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
