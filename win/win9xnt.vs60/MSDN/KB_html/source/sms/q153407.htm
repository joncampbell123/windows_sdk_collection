<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0 and 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
On a Windows NT client computer, the Service Pack version information is
not collected by Systems Management Server inventory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The CurrentVersion value is collected during inventory in the following
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree:
<P>
<PRE>   \SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT

</PRE>Therefore, Windows NT 3.51 is displayed. However, the CSDVersion value is
not collected during inventory.
<P>
The ability to see which service packs have been installed is important for
managing computers in a network enterprise. Some software only runs on
specific Service Pack versions, and an administrator needs to be able to
determine which computer has been upgraded and which one still requires
upgrades to a specific Service Pack. This feature allows us to see whether
the update to a new service pack has been successful. Windows NT resets the
value CSDVersion at every boot time to match the kernel that is loaded.
Therefore, if an update job fails, the computer still displays the previous
service pack version that was inventoried.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
