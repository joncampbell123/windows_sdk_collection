The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, versions 1.1 and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A delete special based on "Machines with last activity" from the Sites
window will remove inactive computers from the Sites window, but will not
remove any static Machine groups that included those computers. In their
place, there will be a blank line with a machine icon at the beginning.
<P>
In Systems Management Server, version 1.1 only, this can result in an Dr.
Watson error if a package is dropped on a machine group where old deleted
machines remain. For example:
<P>
An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
generated.
<P>
SMSEXEC.exe
Exception: access violation (0xc0000005), address 0x1f0f1dd4
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Manually delete the inactive computer from the machine group.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Manually delete the computer from the Sites window.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
