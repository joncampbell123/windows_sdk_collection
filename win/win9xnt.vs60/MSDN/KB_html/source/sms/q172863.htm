The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When an Execute Path statement has been added to the Install.log file so
that an external application will run when the application is removed,
that external application does not always start successfully. For an
example, see the MORE INFORMATION section of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Create a batch file that contains the full command that that needs to be
   run. Then modify the Execute Path statement's command line to run the
   batch file.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If the file that needs to be acted on by the executable is associated
   with that executable, the command line only needs to reference the file
   to be acted on. For example, the following command line would cause the
   Notetst.txt file to be displayed successfully in Notepad:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\Test\Notetst.txt
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
Installer version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For example, if the following command is added to the Install.log, it would
not run successfully when the application is removed:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\TEST\NOTEPAD.EXE C:\TEST\NOTETST.TXT

</PRE>The Installer script item would appear like:
<P>
<PRE>   Add "Execute Path: %UNINSTP%\NOTEPAD.EXE %UNINSTP%\NOTETST.TXT" to
   INSTALL.LOG

</PRE>From a normal command line, this would display the contents of the
Notetst.txt file in Notepad. The breaking point occurs when the command
line references an executable and subsequent file that the executable
should act on.
<P>
If the command line only references an executable, it works correctly.
In the example above, Notepad will not start at all.
