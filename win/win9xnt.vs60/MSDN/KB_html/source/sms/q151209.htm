The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0 and 1.1

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An SMS shared program item's title is renamed from the SMS Administrator's
tool, and then the Program Group Control (PGC) is carried out at an SMS
client. After PGC is done, the SMS program item has the original title and
not the new title. The only way to get the icon title to change is to
modify the shared application's properties so that the registry name is
changed in some fashion.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If the program title and nothing else is changed, the SMS Applications
Manager service will not update the program item time stamp in the network
applications database (NAD). The time stamp in the NAD will match the time
stamp for this program item in the client system's registry. PGC compares
these time stamps, and because they are the same, PGC will not send the DDE
commands needed to remove the old program icon and add the program icon
back with the new title.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SMS version 1.1. A fix to
this problem is in development, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information on the
availability of this fix.
