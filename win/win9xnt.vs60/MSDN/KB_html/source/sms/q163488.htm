The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When a job's Offer After and/or Mandatory After attributes are set to a
time that arrives after the initial detection of the package's arrival to
the workstation, Package Command Manager (PCM) does not display the
package until one of the following two situations occurs:

<UL><LI>PCM is restarted, requiring either a log off and subsequent log on, or
   a restart of the computer.

<LI>Another package arrives, causing the .ins file to be changed.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because PCM only processes the .ins file when it
detects that the file has been changed since its last polling cycle. If
the .ins file has not been modified since it was last checked, PCM goes
back to sleep. Therefore, any delayed instruction is not processed either
until the file is modified by another job, or until PCM is restarted on a
computer (causing PCM to process the file regardless of a change).
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If the job has already been sent, and the computers are not available to
log off and log back on, send a dummy package to the targeted computers to
start the job.
<P>
Otherwise, if you are sending new jobs, make sure the Offer After and/or
Mandatory After dates are before the time the package instructions reach
the workstation.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
A supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
