The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0 and 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After running RSAPPCTL, Program Group Controller (PGC) icons point to an
incorrect share. Clicking on those icons results either in an incorrect
shared application being launched from the server, or in an error.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Applications Manager is responsible for building and maintaining the
Network Applications Database (NAD), on each site server (see Appendix C,
SMS System Flow of the "SMS Administrators Guide" for further information).
When RSAPPCTL is run, it sends a 'RESET ALL' command to the Applications
Manager component of the site(s) you specified when running RSAPPCTL.
In SMS 1.0 and 1.1, the reset may be processed incorrectly, causing the NAD
to contain incorrect share points for some shared packages.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Be sure to back up your SMS site before attempting the following
workaround. (See Appendix K of the "SMS Administrators Guide" for correct
backup procedures)
<P>
NOTE: Clients updating PGC information by polling during the following
procedure may have their registry updated with incomplete shared packages
information. Be sure that clients poll the server for new PGC information
after the following procedure is completed.
<P>
For any sites that demonstrate the NAD share point corruption, perform the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Stop the Applications Manager and Maintenance Manager services on the
   site server..

<P><LI>Delete the NAD files on the site server. These are located in
   &lt;SMS Root&gt;\SITE.SRV\MAINCFG.BOX\APPCTL.SRC\DATABASE

<P><LI>Delete the NAD files on the logon server(s) for that site:
   These are located in &lt;SMS Root&gt;\LOGON.SRV\APPCTL.BOX\DATABASE

<P><LI>Restart the Applications Manager and Maintenance Manager services.

<P><LI>Ensure that the NAD files are re-created on the site and logon servers.
   Note that the time it takes for this last step to occur depends on the
   frequency of the services for that site. Applications and Maintenance
   Manager logs will record the re-creation of the NAD files.

<P><LI>Ensure that clients poll the server for updated PGC information. You may
   see a dialog box indicating that the client is deconfiguring and
   reconfiguring shared package information.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. This problem has been corrected in Systems Management
Server version 1.2.
