The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install or upgrade a Systems Management Server Primary
Site, the Primary Site Configuration dialog screen reappears.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when an installation error is detected during the
installation phase, a component fails to install, or the component fails to
start correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If the Primary Site configuration dialog screen reappears due to a
component failure during installation, investigate the source of the
failure. The SMSSETUP.LOG file in the root of the Systems Management Server
Site Server C drive is useful for finding installation/upgrade failure
points.
<P>
Under no circumstances should the Systems Management Server share name
comments be changed from those created by Systems Management Server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When the Primary Site Configuration dialog screen reappears, it still
contains the information you entered earlier in the installation process
(such as Site Code, Site Name, Site Server, and Site Server Domain). If you
change the Site Code when the second dialog screen is displayed, Systems
Management Server Executive, Inventory Agent, and Package command Manager
services do not install successfully. The Systems Management Server
installation program is dependent upon the share comments created for
shares SMS_SITE, SMS_SHR, etc.
