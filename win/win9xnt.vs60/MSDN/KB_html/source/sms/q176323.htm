The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 (IE 4.0) Setup is based on an ActiveX
engine named Active Setup, which runs on the client's computer. You can
create a custom setup package without rewriting IE 4.0 Setup. To do that,
you create a custom version of IE4setup.exe using the Microsoft Internet
Explorer Administration Kit (IEAK).
<P>
After creating an IE4setup.exe file that fits the needs of your
organization, you can use Systems Management Server to deploy that file to
your clients. Do not use the Microsoft SMS Installer to deploy IE 4.0. For
more information about the Internet Explorer Administrator Kit, review the
information on the Microsoft Web site at <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/ieak/">http://www.microsoft.com/ieak/.</A></B>
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
