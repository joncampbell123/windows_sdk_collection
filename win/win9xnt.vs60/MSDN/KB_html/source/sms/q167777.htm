<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, version 1.2 Service Pack 2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Included with Service Pack 2 for Systems Management Server 1.2 is new
functionality that allows a Systems Management Server client's inventory to
be "moved" in a multiple site hierarchy.
<P>
With all prior versions of Systems Management Server, a client's inventory
would not be automatically deleted from an old site's database if the
client started reporting to a new one. The administrator would have had to
delete the old client record manually, by using the Systems Management
Server Administrator program.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following steps describe what is involved when a client starts
reporting to a new site/domain combination:

<OL><P><LI>When a Systems Management Server client detects a site or domain change,
   the client inventory agent updates the Sms.ini file with the new values
   and sends up a full resynchronization (resync) inventory to the new
   Systems Management Server logon server.

<P><LI>The Dataloader service at the new site compares the client's inventory
   to the record (if any) in the database to see if the client's site code
   has changed. If there is no existing client inventory record, the .mif
   file is processed normally and no further action is taken by the
   Dataloader service.

<P><LI>If the site code for the client is different, the Dataloader computes
   the site that would be the lowest in the hierarchy, yet still able to
   tell the old-site from the new-site. This computed site is called the
   cross-site, and is the only site from which the actual movement is
   "commanded." The cross-site is important because it prevents more than
   one site from sending delete MIFs.

<P><LI>If the current site is the cross-site, the tree of sites immediately
   below the cross-site that the client used to report to is computed and
   each one added to an "old-site" list.

<P><LI>The client inventory .mif file that initiated all of this is processed
   normally and then passed up to the parent site (if any). Any sites above
   the cross-site evaluate the .mif file in the same fashion, but will not
   take any further action, because they determine themselves not to be the
   cross-site.

<P><LI>For each primary site in the old-site list, a small delete MIF is
   created for this particular client, which is then handed to the site
   reporter service running on the cross-site.

<P><LI>The site reporter creates one or more mini-jobs (system jobs) to send
   these delete MIFs to the specific target primary sites.

<P><LI>The losing-sites receives the delete MIF and processes a simple delete
   just as if it came from the Systems Management Server Administrator
   program. This action also revokes the Systems Management Server client
   license from the License Manager as well.
<P>
</OL>Administrators should still use the Systems Management Server Database
Manager (Dbclean.exe) to purge Unused Common/Specific Records and old
history. The small delete MIF mentioned above only does a simple task in
the database of moving the deleted client into history.
<P>
The log file created by the Dataloader service, Datalodr.log, contains
specific entries for this new functionality to show what the service is
doing.
