The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When examining the inventory properties of a computer running Windows NT,
the processor speed is not reported. However, for computers running MS-DOS
or OS/2, the processor speed is reported.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Systems Management Server collects inventory properties for computers
running Windows NT by examining the system registry. With Windows NT 3.1
and 3.5x, the processor speed is not reported in the registry.
Additionally, due to the hardware abstraction that is a part of Windows
NT, SMS inventory can not profile the CPU directly as it does with other
operating systems. Because the processor speed is not available, Systems
Management Server was not designed to report CPU speed for computers
running Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest
U.S. Service Pack for Systems Management Server version 1.2. For
information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE> S E R V P A C K


</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
With Windows NT 4.0, the CPU speed is now reported in the system registry.
This only applies to systems with a Pentium processor or better.  Those
systems with a 486 or “slower” processor will still not report the
processor speed.  The value that Systems Management Server queries is
located in the following registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   \\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\HARDWARE\DESCRIPTION\System\CentralProcessor\0.

</PRE>Systems Management Server will query the new registry value. If the value
exists, Systems Management Server will report the processor speed.
