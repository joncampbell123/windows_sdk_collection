The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to execute a shared application with a Registry name such as
"name1+name2," you may receive the following message in the Program Group
Control Start dialog box:
<P>
<PRE>   A one-time installation is required. It might take several minutes and
   it might require that Windows be restarted. Do you want to configure
   application now?

</PRE>After you select "yes," the following message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not execute the configuration program for
   SMS\APPLICATIONS\&lt;Application name&gt;

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Normally, if a configuration script is specified, the one-time installation
message is displayed the first time a shared application is executed.
However, the message and subsequent error will occur when there is no
configuration command line specified if the Registry name specified in the
Sharing Properties of the package is in the form "name1+name2," as shown in
the illustration on p. 297 of Chapter 10 in the SMS System Guide.
<P>
The "+" separator in the Registry name implies that there is a family of
applications.  When APPSTART sees that type of Registry name, it splits
it into two parts, name1 and name2. Name1 is regarded as the primary
name and name1+name2 as the compound name. APPSTART then attempts to find
the following Registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   SMS\APPLICATIONS\name1\Configuration\Status

</PRE>That key would exist in a family of applications, such as MSOffice, but in
this case does not exist. APPSTART, failing to find the key, marks the
corresponding key for the compound name
<P>
<PRE>   SMS\APPLICATIONS\name1+name2\Configuration\Status

</PRE>as CONFIGURE instead of SUCCESS. Normally a Configuration Status of
CONFIGURE would cause the Configuration Command Line (ConfigureScript) to
be executed. Since there is no Configuration Script specified, APPSTART
errors.
<P>
Unless the shared application is part of a family of applications or has a
configuration script specified, the Registry name in the Program Item
Properties of the Sharing Properties of a package should not contain a "+"
sign.
