The information in this article applies to:

</UL>

SUMMARY
 
<P>
This article describes some differences between software inventories and
audits, and describes the procedure to create an audit.
<P>
The following are some differences between audits and software inventories:

<UL><LI>A software inventory occurs during client inventory, while an audit
   occurs when it is run from Package Command Manager (PCM).

<LI>A software inventory does not need to be distributed, because
   distribution occurs automatically through the Package.rul file
   (Sms\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Pkgrule), and is automatically copied to each
   Logon.srv directory as Pkg_16.cfg. You must send out an audit as a job.

<LI>A software inventory affects all Systems Management Server users logging
   in, while an audit will only be run by the clients to whom it was sent.

<LI>A software inventory needs to be defined, and clients will access the
   Pkg_16.cfg file (inventory criteria) during login from the Logon.srv
   directory. An audit uses the Audit.rul file to define the search
   criteria.

<LI>The Run or Share Packages commands can also be defined as software
   inventory packages, if you select "inventory this package" (this allows
   automatic software inventory of Systems Management Server distributed
   packages). Audits detect only those packages defined in the Audit.rul
   file.

<LI>A software inventory can be set to collect files, but an audit cannot.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To create an audit, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>At the Systems Management Server site server, open a command prompt.

<P><LI>Navigate to the Sms\Primsite.srv\Audit directory

<P><LI>Run Rul2cfg Audit.rul. You will see "Compile succeeded" and "1 file(s)
    copied" three times.

<P><LI>Open File Manager and share the Sms\Primsite.srv\Audit\Package
    directory as "package."

<P><LI>Run the Systems Management Server Administrator and select the package
    window.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click New.

<P><LI>Click Import.

<P><LI>Select Sms\Primsite.srv\Import.src\Enu in the Directories box.

<P><LI>Click Audit.pdf and then click OK.

<P><LI>Click Workstation.

<P><LI>Enter the source directory (for example, \\Smsserver\Package), and
    click OK.

<P><LI>Click OK, and then click OK again to "Update the package at all sites."

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Open. Select the Sites window.

<P><LI>On the Window menu, click Tile Horizontally.

<P><LI>Drag and drop the package to the site or client(s) that you intend to
    run the audit on. A Jobs window will open.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Click Schedule and change the priority to High. Click OK.

<P><LI>Type a comment (for example, "Test audit"), and click OK.
<P>
</OL>The package will now be pending until the next process polling cycle. You
can monitor the package's progress by viewing the SCHED, DESPOOL, and
LANSEND log files, as well as by monitoring the job in the Jobs window (to
do this, double click on the job, click Status, and then click Details).
<P>
Once the package is offered to the client's Package Command Manager, run
the package. If packages are found, there will be a new icon in the
Personal Computer Properties called "Audited Software."
