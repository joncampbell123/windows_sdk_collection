The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When installing Systems Management Server 1.2, the installation may fail
with the any of the following problems:

<UL><LI>Error 7411 from SMS_SITE_CONFIG_MANAGER in the application event log

<LI>No Systems Management Server service running

<LI>No Systems Management Server shares are created (sms_shr aso.)

<LI>No Logon.srv directory and missing files
<P>
</UL>Also, the Systems Management Server client installation may be affected on
client computers running Windows NT. The Client Configuration Manager (CCM)
connects to the ADMIN$ share of a client computer running Windows NT to
install the Systems Management Server Remote Control Agent and Client
Inventory Agent services. If this share is not available, the services will
not be installed, and the CCM will log the following error in the
Clicfg.log file:
<P>
<PRE>   ERROR: The SMS service account does not have administrative rights on
   machine "&lt;client computer running Windows NT&gt;" for request "YAP00001".

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the administrator uses the policy editor from
Windows NT 4.0. Due to a reported problem with the policy editor, all
administrative shares ($ shares) are disabled after a restart. This causes
the setup script to fail, because it uses the administrative shares during
the installation. Also, after Systems Management Server 1.2 is installed,
the removal of an administrative share may influence normal operation.
Systems Management Server's architecture is related to the existence of the
administrative shares.
<P>
<P>
For more information, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
<P>
<PRE>    ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q156365.htm">Q156365</A></B>
    TITLE     : Hidden Shares Are No Longer Available After Using System Policy

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Make sure that all administrative shares are available before setting up
Systems Management Server 1.2.
<P>
Also read article <B><A href="../winnt/q156365.htm">Q156365</A></B> carefully if you use or plan to use the policy
editor in connection with Systems Management Server 1.2.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 that effects
Systems Management Server version 1.2. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
