<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following incorrect behavior applies only to "Run Command On
Workstation" jobs and does not happen with "Share Package On Server" jobs.
<P>
When you take an existing package, one that has previously been distributed
to a machine group, and try to refresh that package on a new group that
contains a partial list of servers from the original group, the
distribution servers are not refreshed.
<P>
The SMS Despooler processed the instruction file but fails to decompress
the package and copy any files.
<P>
This occurs when only the "Put on Specified Distribution Servers" is
selected in the Distribute phase of the Job Details window.
<P>
NOTE: If you select "Refresh Existing Distribution Servers" the package is
distributed to all the original distribution servers regardless of the
machine group selected in the drop down box within that dialog.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If it is necessary to refresh certain distribution servers, Select "Refresh
Existing Distribution Servers" in the Distribute Phase of the Job Details
window. This refreshes all original distribution servers for this package.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
