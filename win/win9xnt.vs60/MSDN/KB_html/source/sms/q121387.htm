The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When programs are run from a logon script, and they are located in the
NETLOGON share, the actual logon script does not know what drive or path
from which to execute the program, and the NETLOGON share is not included
in the DOS path statement. To resolve this, Systems Management Server
utilizes a little known feature of DOS to "determine" the drive and path
the script is running from.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
During a logon and when the logon script is running, the LMSCRIPT.EXE
program runs its commands from the NETLOGON share. However, batch files
have no way of determining where they are running from, and the current
directory set by LMSCRIPT.EXE is not the NETLOGON share.
<P>
As a workaround, Systems Management Server uses the %0\..\ path to indicate
the argv[0] present when the batch file was run. The batch file can then
refer to this path and know its own location and look for other files
there.
<P>
An example of this can be found in the Slow Network detection portion of
the SMSLS.BAT logon script file:
<P>
<PRE>   REM SNET_DOS
   %0\..\netspeed
   if not errorlevel 1 goto NET_DOS
   if not errorlevel 2 goto END
   if errorlevel 2 %0\..\choice /T:Y,30 Slow network detected. Continue
   if not errorlevel 2 goto NET_DOS
   goto END

</PRE>Prior to use of this technique, Systems Management Server was forced to use
a hard coded drive letter of Z: to reference needed files. Now the drive
used during a NET LOGON can be arbitrary, and dynamically determined.
