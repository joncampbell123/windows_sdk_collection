The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server, version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
With some Systems Management Server site configurations, an Apple
Macintosh computer may exhibit errors and appear to stop responding when
the initial Systems Management Server inventory is taken on that system.
<P>
This problem occurs when the Systems Management Server site server is
located in a different AppleTalk zone than the Macintosh client.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
During the initial installation of the Systems Management Server client,
the Domain.ini file is copied to the client. This file is later modified
and renamed to Sms.ini. When the Macintosh restarts, the INVMAC program
runs and attempts to connect to a Systems Management Server in the
AppleTalk zone specified in the Domain.ini file to finalize the
configuration and to report the initial inventory.
<P>
By default, the Domain.ini file contains an asterisk (*) that signifies
that the Macintosh can find the Systems Management Server site server in
the Macintosh's default zone. If the computer running Systems Management
Server that the Macintosh is reporting to resides in a different zone than
the Macintosh, this process fails.
<P>
The AppleTalk zone information is gathered by the Invwin32.exe inventory
agent residing on the Systems Management Server site server, and is
written to the registry at the following key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Identificaiton

</PRE>With Systems Management Server 1.2, this information is not always written
to the registry properly.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use Regedt32 to modify the Systems Management Server registry to contain
the AppleTalk zone name.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT or Microsoft Systems
Management Server to correct them. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any
problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use this
tool at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>Open Regedt32.

<P><LI>Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Identification.

<P><LI>Add a new value called "AppleTalk Zone Name" (without the quotation
   marks), and make the Data Type REG_SZ. Add the correct AppleTalk zone
   name for the value.
<P>
</OL>When the Systems Management Server Maintenance Manager service starts its
next watchdog cycle, the new registry entry will be picked up, and the
Domain.ini file will be modified. Once this file has been modified,
Macintosh computers can be installed, and will inventory properly.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service
Pack for Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information
on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word in the
