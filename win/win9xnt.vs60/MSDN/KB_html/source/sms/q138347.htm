The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The procedure for restoring a Secondary site that is documented on page 686
of Appendix K of the Systems Management Server Administrators Guide is
insufficient and does not successfully restore a secondary site to a fully
functional site. Below are steps outlined that have been proven to be
successful in completely backing up and restoring a secondary site. The
method outlined in this article assumes your Primary Parent site is up and
running and the SMS database is active and can be accessed successfully.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Backup</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Using Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE) save the
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS key.

<P><LI>Stop all Systems Management Server services from Control Panel Services.

<P><LI>Backup.
<P>
   a. Backup the entire \SMS directory and all subdirectories (including
<P><PRE>      the SITECTRL.CT0 file which is required for this procedure). Please
      see CAUTION below.
</PRE><P>
   b. Backup the entire \MS directory.
<P>
   c. Backup the entire \SMS_PKGx directory (x is the drive where the
<P><PRE>      package is installed).
</PRE><P>
   d. Backup the SMS.INI file.
<P>
</OL><h3>Restore</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On target computer, install Windows NT Server as it existed on
   the previous SMS Secondary Site.
<P>
   NOTE: The rules under step 1 on page 686 of the SMS Administrators Guide
   must be followed, specifically the computer and domain name must be the
   same as before.

<P><LI>Create and restore the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS key in
   the Registry using Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE). You are restoring the
   SMS key saved in step 1 above (Backup).

<P><LI>Restore everything from step 3 above:
<P>
   a. The \SMS directory and all files within. Please see CAUTION below.
<P>
   b. The \MS directory.
<P>
   c. The entire \SMS_PKGx directory.
<P>
   d. The SMS.INI file.

<P><LI>From the \PSSTOOLS directory on the SMS Retail compact disc, locate and
   run the INSTSRV.EXE utility for your specific platform as follows:
<P>
   a. At the command prompt, change to a Windows NT directory containing
<P><PRE>      INSTSRV.EXE, type INSTSRV and select option 1 (Install).
</PRE><P>
   b. Respond to prompts following this example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Enter service name: SMS_SITE_CONFIG_MANAGER
      Enter domain and user name: DOMAIN\SMS Service Account
       (This is the SMS service account used with the original SMS
<PRE></PRE>        installation, i.e. SMSADMIN)
      Enter password: &lt;Enter your SMS Service Account password&gt;
       (The password is case sensitive)
      Enter computername: \\&lt;server name&gt;
       (This is the server name of the Secondary Site server)
      Enter path: C:\SMS\SITE.SRV\X86.BIN\SITEINS.EXE
       (This is a local path of the SMS tree on the secondary site
        server)
      Autostart service during bootup? (Y/N): Y

      This step will install and start the SMS Site Configuration Manager
      (SCMAN) service onto the target computer. Afterwards, SCMAN will
      install and start the other SMS services bringing the site up to full
      operational status.

</PRE></OL>CAUTION: If you backup the entire \SMS directory and inventory new client
computers, new UID files will be created in the \SMS\LOGON.SRV\SMSID
directory. If you restore the entire \SMS directory, including the UID
files, make sure that the new client computers inventoried do not have
duplicate SMS ID numbers.
