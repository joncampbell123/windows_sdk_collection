The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After Systems Management Server jobs are canceled, it may appear that
subsequent jobs remain in a pending state. The Systems Management Server
Despoolr.log file may display the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Despooler failed to execute the instruction, error code = 38a

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Canceling a Systems Management Server job may corrupt the *.sni file. This
causes the Despooler Service to process very slowly through each corrupt
file, and display the message listed in the Symptoms section. SNI files are
job status MIFS returning from the client, and are processed before INS
files. It appears that Despooler is not getting to the Pending jobs.
<P>
Also, deleting an active job, or deleting a job before it is completely
canceled can also cause the error to occur.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Examine the SMS\Site.srv\Despoolr.box\Receive directory and move all *.sni
files that are unrelated to current active jobs to a temporary
subdirectory.
<P>
Some good practices to implement include the following:

<UL><LI>If you cancel your jobs, do not delete them until they have been
   canceled for 48 hours.

<LI>If you are canceling jobs, do not cancel more than one at a time.

<LI>Do not delete Active jobs.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
