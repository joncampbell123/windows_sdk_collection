The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.1 and 1.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you execute the Systems Management Server (SMS) Client Setup from a
Windows for Workgroups or Windows 95 client via Remote Access Service
(RAS), the SMS Client Group and Icons are not created.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
After the first phase of Client Setup completes, you are instructed to
restart the system to allow changes to take affect. Since Windows for
Workgroups and Windows 95 RAS clients do not have a network connection when
they are started, the SMSRUN16.EXE file, called from the load= line in the
WIN.INI, does not execute properly. The SMS Client Group and Icons are not
created. This also prevents any autostart components such as PGC and PCM
from starting at bootup.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
After the system has started, make a RAS connection to your network and the
manually execute SMSRUN16.EXE located in the \MS\SMS\BIN directory.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
