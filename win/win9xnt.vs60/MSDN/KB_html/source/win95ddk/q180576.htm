The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release version 2.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Under the Universal Serial Bus (USB) Supplement for OSR 2 (OSR 2.1), it is
possible that a short or aborted USB transfer for a bulk or interrupt
endpoint may cause a subsequent transfer to either fail, or to discard the
first data packet of the transfer. This problem is caused by a data toggle
synchronization problem between the endpoint on the USB device and the
driver (UHCD.SYS) for the UHCI (Universal Host Controller Interface) USB
host controller.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem arises because the UHCI driver computes the data toggle for an
endpoint based upon the number of transfer descriptors built for the
transfer, rather than the number of transfer descriptors actually used. If
a transfer turns out to be short or aborted, it is possible that the data
toggle state maintained by the UHCI driver will not be synchronized with
the data toggle state maintained by the USB device itself. Subsequent
attempts to transfer data on the endpoint may fail due to the incorrect
data toggle. It is also possible that a subsequent transfer request will
succeed if the USBD_SHORT_TRANSFER_OK flag is set, but will discard the
first data packet of the transfer due to the mismatched data toggle.
<P>
It should be noted that this problem only exists in the UHCI driver for OSR
2.1, and does not exist in the OHCI (Open Host Controller Interface) driver
(OPENHCI.SYS).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
On all short or aborted transfers, a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver must
reset the data toggle states maintained by both the UHCI driver and the USB
device itself. To do so, the following sequence must be followed when the
short or aborted transfer occurs:

<OL><P><LI>Reset the pipe using the URB_FUNCTION_RESET_PIPE function. On OSR 2.1
   this will cause the UHCI driver to reset the data toggle state
   maintained by the driver to DATA0, and return a URB status of
   0x40000005. On an OHCI controller this function will return a URB status
   of USBD_STATUS_SUCCESS, but it will not cause the data toggle to be
   reset to DATA0 on the host. On post OSR 2.1 implementations of WDM, this
   URB will return a status of STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER because the size of
   the _URB_PIPE_REQUEST URB has changed in post OSR 2.1 implementations of
   WDM. If the URB_FUNCTION_RESET_PIPE request returns a URB status of
   anything other than 0x40000005, the WDM driver should simply resume
   normal operation because the data toggle problem does not exist outside
   of the OSR 2.1 version of the UHCI host controller driver.

<P><LI>Assuming the URB_FUNCTION_RESET_PIPE URB returns a URB status of
   0x40000005, the WDM driver should then issue a clear feature request for
   the pipe using the URB_FUNCTION_CLEAR_FEATURE_TO_ENDPOINT function with
   a feature selector of ENDPOINT_STALL. Firmware on the USB device must
   reset the data toggle to DATA0 when it receives this clear feature
   request.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
