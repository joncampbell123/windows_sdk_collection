The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.2, 4.2c, 4.3, 4.3c
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you choose a toolbar button from the Microsoft Office Toolbar in order
to switch to an application that is already running, a second instance of
the application may be started.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when you are trying to switch to an application
(such as Organizer personal information manager version 1.0 or 1.1 by Lotus
Development) that runs in the following manner:

<OL><P><LI>You start the executable (.EXE) file.

<P><LI>The .EXE file starts one or more dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that
   comprise the bulk of the program.

<P><LI>The .EXE file removes itself from memory.
<P>
</OL>If the program runs in this manner, when you select the program's MOM
toolbar button, a second instance of the application is started because the
.EXE file assigned to the button is no longer running. Because, in this
case, the .EXE file is only running for a few seconds (when the application
is initially started), MOM will start a second instance of the application.
<P>
Note: This problem does not occur in version 2.0 of the Organizer personal
information manager by Lotus Development.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Office Manager
(MOM) versions listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
