that are entered in the Microsoft(R) Windows(R) 95 and Windows NT(R)
registry. This behavior sometimes causes problems later when you
attempt to configure Microsoft Office 97 differently. For more
information about these issues, search for articles in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base. To find the Knowledge Base on the World Wide Web,
see the following Microsoft Web site:
<P>
