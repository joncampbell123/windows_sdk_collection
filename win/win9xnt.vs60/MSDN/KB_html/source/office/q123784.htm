The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.2, 4.3
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0c
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0c
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform a workstation installation of any of the Microsoft
applications listed above, and if you are running AppMeter, a software
usage metering application for networks, you may encounter any of the
following symptoms:

<UL><LI>In File Manager, when you double-click on a file with the extension
   .XLS, .DOC, or .PPT, you are prompted for the location of the executable
   (.EXE) file for the application.

<LI>When you activate an embedded object, such as a Microsoft Excel 5.0
   Worksheet object, in the client application, you receive an error
   message indicating that the application cannot be found for editing the
   object.

<LI>You cannot insert an object created by one of the applications listed
   above, such as a Microsoft Word 6.0 Document object. Note that in this
   case, if you log on to the network as administrator, you may be able to
   insert an object created by one of these applications without receiving
   an error message.
<P>
</UL>This is true for Appmeter version 1.0 and 1.1.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
AppMeter hides the original application executable file, such as EXCEL.EXE,
and places a "stub" executable file with the same name as the original
executable file, in a "stub" directory that you specify. The initial
default "stub" directory is the directory you assign when you install
AppMeter. When you run the "stub" file, AppMeter unhides the original
executable file and runs the application.
<P>
This behavior creates a problem for some applications, such as Microsoft
Excel, because of the way that Microsoft Excel uses the REG.DAT file. Every
time you run Microsoft Excel, the application is registered again in the
REG.DAT file. This means that the REG.DAT entry for Microsoft Excel
contains a path to the EXCEL.EXE file that doesn't always exist.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around these problems, use the appropriate method below:
<P>
Method 1: If a dialog box appears asking for the location of an
<PRE>          application's executable (.EXE) file when you double-click a
          document in File Manager, enter the complete path to the "stub"
          file for the application. The information you enter is added to
          the [programs] section in your WIN.INI file, and is used the next
          time you double-click this file type in File Manager.

</PRE>Method 2: If you have trouble inserting or activating an embedded object,
<PRE>          when the application that created the object is metered by
          AppMeter, do the following:

          a. Add the application's "stub" directory to the PATH statement
             in your  AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

          b. (For Excel) Edit every path statement in your WIN.INI file
             that  references EXCEL.EXE so that it references the "stub"
             EXCEL.EXE file.

</PRE>NOTE: A more complete way to resolve these issues is to completely remove
AppMeter from your system, install the application in question
(administrative installation to the server as well as workstation
installation to the workstation), and then reinstall AppMeter. This method
has been reported to prevent having to modify the WIN.INI, AUTOEXEC.BAT,
and REG.DAT files.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
AppMeter is a software usage metering application for Novell networks. Once
you register an application using AppMeter, AppMeter monitors how many
people are running that application from the network at one time. You can
also use AppMeter to limit the number of people that can run the
application at any one time.
<P>
AppMeter runs on Novell NetWare/286 and /386, and you can use the
application to meter the use of both MS-DOS and Windows programs.
