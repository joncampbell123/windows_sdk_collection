The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you insert an object from one program (for example, a Microsoft Excel
97 worksheet object) into another program (for example, Microsoft
PowerPoint 97), and you deactivate and reactivate the inserted object, the
Undo command behaves differently in each program. This article explains the
differences in behavior among the Office programs.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Each Microsoft Office 97 program includes an Undo command. This command
allows you to undo certain actions after you perform them; for example, if
you type a value in a worksheet cell, you can undo the action. To use the
Undo command, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Click Undo on the Edit menu.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Click the Undo tool on the Standard toolbar.
<P>
</UL>When you click the Undo arrow on the Standard toolbar, you can see a list
of the actions you performed. This list is called the "undo stack."
Normally, the undo stack is cleared only when you perform an irreversible
action, such as closing a file. When you reopen the file, no items are
listed in the undo stack.
<P>
However, when you insert an object into another program, the behavior of
the undo stack varies for each program included in Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Word 97 Document Objects</h3>
 
<P>
When you insert a Microsoft Word 97 document object into another program,
make changes to the object, deactivate the object, and then reactivate the
object, the undo stack is not cleared. As a result, you can still undo
changes that you previously made to the document object.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel 97 Worksheet Objects and Chart Objects</h3>
 
<P>
When you insert a Microsoft Excel 97 worksheet object or chart object into
another program, make changes to the object, deactivate the object, and
then reactivate the object, the undo stack is cleared. You cannot undo
changes that you previously made to the worksheet object or chart object.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft PowerPoint 97 Presentation Objects</h3>
 
<P>
When you insert a Microsoft PowerPoint 97 presentation object into another
program, make changes to the object, deactivate the object, and then
reactivate the object, the undo stack is cleared. You cannot undo changes
that you previously made to the presentation object.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Access 97 Database Objects</h3>
 
<P>
You cannot insert a Microsoft Access 97 database object into another
program.
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
To see an example of the behavior of the undo stack, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Microsoft Word 97, create a new document.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Object. In the Object Type list, click
   Microsoft Excel Worksheet and click OK.

<P><LI>In the Microsoft Excel worksheet object, type random values in some of
   the cells.

<P><LI>Click the Undo arrow on the Standard toolbar.
<P>
   Note that the list contains several items, such as Typing. When you
   are done, click a cell in the worksheet object.

<P><LI>Deactivate the worksheet object by clicking in the Microsoft Word
   document.

<P><LI>Reactivate the worksheet object by double-clicking it.

<P><LI>Click the Undo arrow on the Standard toolbar.
<P>
</OL>Note that the list contains only one item, the Last item.
<P>
If you perform these same steps when you use a Microsoft PowerPoint 97
presentation object, the behavior is the same. If you insert a Microsoft
Word 97 document object into another program, the Undo list contains all of
the same items after you reactivate the document object.
