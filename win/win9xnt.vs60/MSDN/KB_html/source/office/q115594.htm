The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.0, 4.2, 4.2c, 4.3, 4.3c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform a Workstation installation of Microsoft Office on a
computer running Windows from a server, up to 2.8 megabytes (MB) of extra
files may be installed in your Windows directory. The groups of files that
are installed include ODBC drivers (always installed) or system .DLLs (may
be installed under certain conditions).
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following information describes the types of files that are installed
and discusses the conditions under which the .DLLs may be installed.
<P>
<P><h3>ODBC Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
This group includes all of the ODBC drivers that ship with Microsoft
Office. These drivers will always be installed to your Windows directory
when you install ODBC support. To avoid having these files installed to
your directory, you can prevent ODBC drivers from being installed, so that
ODBC functionality is NOT installed and is not available on the
workstation.
<P>
For more information about preventing the ODBC drivers from being
installed, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../setup/q117717.htm">Q117717</A></B>
   TITLE     : ODBC Files Installed to User Directory with Shared Windows

</PRE><h3>System .DLLs</h3>
 
<P>
This group includes system .DLLs that must be added to Windows to provide
support for new features such as OLE 2.0. These files will be installed to
your local Windows directory if, during the Workstation installation, the
Setup program is unable to locate the .DLLs in the shared Windows
directory.
<P>
Setup will be unable to locate the .DLLs in the shared Windows directory
if, during the original Administrative installation (SETUP /A) of Office,
the following occurred:

<UL><LI>SETUP /A was not run under the shared installation of Windows (or the
   system administrator did not have full rights to the shared Windows
   directory on the server).
<P>
   -or-

<LI>During the time of installation, another user was also running the
   shared installation of Windows.
<P>
</UL>The following is a list of the files that could potentially be installed in
your Windows directory:
