The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, version 5.0, 5.0a
<LI>Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, versions 4.2, 4.2.1, 4.2.1a, 4.2.1b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to start Microsoft Excel from the Microsoft Office Manager
(MOM), you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The application is in the Trash. To use it, first drag it out of the
   Trash.

</PRE>At this point, your only option is to click OK.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You may experience this problem if all of the following are true:

<UL><LI>You have just installed the Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh 15-digit
   patch.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You followed the directions in the Read Me file included with the
   15-digit patch.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You dragged the original Microsoft Excel file (renamed "Old Excel," as
   the instructions indicated in the Read Me file) into the Trash, but you
   did not empty the trash.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You tried to start Microsoft Excel from the Office Manager menu.
<P>
</UL>The reason why you receive the error message is that the Office Manager
follows the original Microsoft Excel file around on your hard drive, even
if it is renamed. Therefore, if it is in the Trash, the program can't start
because the system will not allow applications to start from within the
Trash.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, empty the Trash, and then do the following:

<OL><P><LI>On the MOM menu, click Customize.

<P><LI>In the MOM window, click the entry for Microsoft Excel, and then click
   Edit.

<P><LI>In the next dialog box, click Change, and then locate and open the
   folder containing the patched version of Microsoft Excel version 5.0.

<P><LI>Click Microsoft Excel, and then click Add.

<P><LI>Click OK, and then close the Microsoft Office Manager window.
<P>
</OL>When you click Microsoft Excel on the MOM menu, the newly patched version
should start.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The directions in the Read Me file that is included with the 15-digit patch
does not explicitly state that you should move the original, unpatched,
copy of Microsoft Excel to the Trash. Therefore, if you do not move the
original Microsoft Excel file (renamed to "Old Excel") to the Trash, you
may end up with two copies of the Microsoft Excel executable in your
Microsoft Excel folder. Then, if you try to start Microsoft Excel from the
Office Manager menu, the wrong instance of the program may start.
<P>
To verify which copy is running, enter the number 1.40737488355328 into a
cell. If the cell value changes to 1.28, then the unpatched version of
Microsoft Excel is running. To clear up this problem, drag the original
Microsoft Excel file (renamed to "Old Excel") to the Trash, and then empty
the Trash.
