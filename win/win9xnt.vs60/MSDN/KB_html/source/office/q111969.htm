The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.0, 4.2
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, version 6.0, 6.0a
<LI>Microsoft System Information version 1.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1
<LI>Microsoft Access versions 1.1 and 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you install Microsoft Excel after you install Microsoft Word for
Windows, you may receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   This application uses CTL3DV2.DLL which has not been correctly
   installed.

</PRE>when you do either of the following:

<UL><LI>You choose the System Info button in the About dialog box to run
   Microsoft System Information version 1.0.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You run the Grammar Checker in Microsoft Word for Windows.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error may occur if you are running Windows over a network after you
perform a workstation installation of Microsoft Excel version 5.0.
Microsoft Excel installs version 2.04 of the CTL3DV2.DLL file (dated
12/14/93) in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory. This version of the
CTL3DV2.DLL file cannot be correctly loaded over a network if the Windows
program directory is mapped to the root of a drive letter. This error does
not occur if CTL3DV2.DLL loads from your local hard drive.
<P>
This error does not occur if you are running version 2.05 of the
CTL3DV2.DLL file (dated 10/14/93), which ships with other applications that
supply Microsoft System Information, such as Word version 6.0 for Windows.
<P>
NOTE: The file size for both version 2.04 and 2.05 of CTL3DV2.DLL is
the same (21648 bytes).
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Excel for
Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, decompress CTL3DV2.DLL version 2.05 from your
Microsoft Word 6.0 or Microsoft Office disks and replace the Microsoft
Excel 5.0 version of the CTL3DV2.DLL file in the \windows\system
subdirectory. CTL3DV2.DLL is located on Disk 1 of both the Word 6.0 and
Office version 4.0 for Windows disk sets.
<P>
Note that the file CTL3DV2.DLL should be located in the \windows\system
subdirectory. This is the same directory on the local drive that CTL3D.DLL
is located in.
