<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Office 97 ValuPack contains components that complement
Microsoft Office 97 and the individual Office programs. Most of the
components can be installed separately with an individual Setup procedure.
You can open some components in an Office program or from the Windows Start
menu.
<P>
To find the Microsoft Office 97 ValuPack, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Office 97 compact disc into the CD-ROM drive.

<P><LI>Start Microsoft Windows Explorer and click the CD-ROM drive (usually
   drive D) to view the files on the Office 97 compact disc.

<P><LI>Double-click the Valupack folder to see the files in that folder.
<P>
</OL>There are many items in the Valupack folder: folders, a Microsoft Power
Point Slide Show file (Overview.pps), and a Help file (Valupk8.hlp).
<P>
Double-clicking the Overview.pps file starts a PowerPoint slide show, which
presents an overview of some of the features that are in the ValuPack.
<P>
NOTE: If a Warning message about running macros appears, click Enable

You can install and use Microsoft Camcorder to record actions, procedures,
and sounds that you perform on the computer. You can save the recording as
a movie that you can then play in Camcorder, or you can save the movie as a
stand-alone program that you can send to others to play even if they don't
have Camcorder. For example, you can use Camcorder to create a computer
tutorial that you can send to others to use. You can set preferences for
movies that you record, for example, the keys to use to stop recording a
movie, the quality of the sound you record, and whether to display
Camcorder in front of open programs.
<P>
Although you cannot run Camcorder under Microsoft Windows NT Workstation,
you can play a movie recorded in Camcorder as a stand-alone program.

development platform for end users, organizations, and content developers.
With innovative Internet conferencing, collaboration, and browser
customization, Internet Explorer 3.0 provides the richest feature set of
any browser while still offering an easy-to-use and personalized Internet
experience.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Office 97 Sounds</h3>
 
<P>
This feature is not available on Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 3.51 or
Windows NT Server 3.51. The Microsoft Office 97 sounds provided in the
Office 97 ValuPack add fun audio cues to screen elements as you work with
them in any Office 97 program. For example, you can add sounds that are
played when you work with toolbars, scroll bars, and dialog boxes, or
sounds that are played when you send mail or sort information.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Office 97 Upgrade Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
The Office 97 Upgrade Wizard is a tool that helps you remove earlier
versions of Office (versions 4.0 and 7.0) from the hard disk. The Upgrade
Wizard is integrated into the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program, so it is
not necessary to run the Upgrade Wizard before you install Microsoft Office
97. This stand-alone version of the Upgrade Wizard, which is included in
the Office 97 ValuPack, can be used by system administrators and advanced
users who want to remove earlier versions of Office before or after
installing Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
The Upgrade Wizard leads you through the process of removing Office files
and system entries in the Windows registry that are not needed by Office
97. You can run the stand-alone Upgrade Wizard in one of the following
three different phases:

<UL><LI>Remove files you don't need. In this phase, the Upgrade Wizard
   determines the earlier versions of Office (4.0 and 7.0) that are on
   the computer. It determines whether you still need the files or whether
   they can be removed. If you run this phase after you install Office 97,
   the wizard does not affect your Office 97 installation.

<LI>Remove old Office components of your choice. In this phase, the
   Upgrade Wizard prompts you to specify the earlier Office (version 4.0
   and 7.0) components you want to remove. You decide which components to
   remove or keep. If you run this phase after you install Office 97, the
   wizard does not affect your Office 97 installation.

<LI>Remove all earlier versions of Office. In this phase, the Upgrade
   Wizard removes all earlier versions of Office (4.0 and 7.0) that are
   installed on your computer.
<P>
</UL>When you run the Upgrade Wizard in any phase, the wizard displays a list of
files to removed. You can choose to remove or keep each file, print or save
the list of files to removed, quit the wizard at any time, and start the
wizard again at any time. You are asked to confirm the removal of any
files.
<P>
Additionally, the Upgrade Wizard never removes any document, template, or
data file that you created with earlier versions of Office or with Office
97.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Office Binder Templates</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Binder templates save time when you create a binder. The
Meeting.obt (Meeting Organizer) and Proposal.obt (Proposal and Marketing
Plan) templates are on the Office 97 compact disc.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Office Far East Support</h3>
 
<P>
If your organization is in the Asia, you may receive documents that include
characters from this region. You can install the Asian (Far East) support
files to install a font and code page translation table.
<P>
The Asian support files make it possible for you to do the following:
<P>
<PRE>   - Correctly display Asian characters in documents created in the Asian
     version of Office 97. Without the Far East font, the characters
     appear as block characters.

   - Convert and view documents from Asian versions of Office 7.0. Without
     the Asian support files, Far East characters are lost.

   - Convert and view HTML documents in Office 97 programs and in
     Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0.

   - Correctly interpret file properties from documents created in the
     Asian version of Office 97. For example, if a document created in the
     Asian version of Word is opened in the United States version of Word,
     and then Properties is clicked on the File menu, the Properties dialog
     box is blank unless you install the appropriate language support file.

</PRE>The Asian support files work if you use Microsoft Windows 95, Windows NT
Workstation 3.51, or Windows NT Workstation 4.0.
<P>
The FarEast folder contains four files that provide support for four
different languages.
<P>

<P>

export any of the following to the watch: appointments, tasks, phone
numbers, anniversaries, birthdays, reminders, and current time and time
zone information.

</PRE><h3>Changes to the ValuPack in Microsoft Office SR-1</h3>
 
<P>
The ValuPack included with Office SR-1 contains several items that were not
included in the original release of the ValuPack. Several of the ValuPack
items have been updated, and one item has been removed from the original
ValuPack.
<P>
<P><h3>New ValuPack Items</h3>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Distributed COM (DCOM) for Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
The COM/DCOM security model enables the creation of secure distributed
applications. COM security can be applied to both existing (legacy) COM
components via external configuration as well as new COM code via the COM
security APIs and interfaces.
<P>
For additional information about DCOM, please see the following articles in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE>For the latest information on Distributed COM for Windows 95, visit the OLE
Development web page at <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/oledev/">http://www.microsoft.com/oledev/.</A></B>

address may change without notice. If this occurs, link to the Microsoft
home page at the following address:

</PRE><h3>Kodak FlashPix/Microsoft Picture It! 1.0 Graphic Import Filter</h3>
 
<P>
Use this graphics filter to import pictures from Kodak FlashPix and
Microsoft Picture It! to Office documents. After you install the filter,
the extensions FlashPix (*.fpx) and Microsoft Picture It! (*.mix) appear in
the file of type list in the Insert Picture dialog box.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel Viewer</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel Viewer 97 is a small program you can freely distribute that
makes it possible for you to share Microsoft Excel files with people who
don't have Microsoft Excel. You can use Microsoft Excel Viewer to open,
view, filter by using AutoFilter, and print Microsoft Excel files.
Microsoft encourages you to copy and distribute Microsoft Excel Viewer
along with your Microsoft Excel workbooks. You cannot edit or save an open
workbook in Microsoft Excel Viewer. Similarly, you can't create new
workbooks in Microsoft Excel Viewer—you'll need Microsoft Excel to do these
things.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Service Pack 2</h3>
 
<P>
If you have installed Office 97 Developer Edition and if you have either
installed the updated ODBC 3.0 Driver Manager or Windows NT 4.0 Service
Pack 3 (which automatically installs the updated ODBC 3.0 Driver Manager),
you must also install Office 97 Developer Edition Service Pack 2 to
maintain the Setup Wizard.
<P>
<P><h3>Updated ODBC 3.0 Driver Manager</h3>
 
<P>
ODBC 3.0 Driver Manager has been updated with enhanced security. You can
now prevent the connect string used to connect to a data source from being
passed to the built-in Trace utility, thereby preventing passwords and
other connection information from being inadvertently stored on a user's
hard disk.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Outlook Rules Wizard</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Outlook Rules Wizard is a client/server messaging manager
that allows users to manage their e-mail communication through defined
inbox rules. Rules are user-defined instructions for performing actions on
incoming and outgoing messages that are usually based on a set of
conditions. Rules are particularly helpful if the user receives a high
volume of e-mail, although users at any level can benefit from the
organizational and information-management value. For example, users can
categorize all incoming mail messages with the word "Internet" in the
subject line, or automatically store a copy of each message they send to
their managers.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft PowerPoint 97 Translator for PowerPoint 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft PowerPoint 97 Translator for PowerPoint 4.0 allows users of
PowerPoint 4.0 to open presentations saved in PowerPoint 97 format. Once
you've installed the translator, PowerPoint 4.0 will automatically
recognize and open PowerPoint 97 presentations. This translator provides an
easy way for PowerPoint 4.0 users to view PowerPoint 97.
<P>
<P><h3>Snapshot Viewer</h3>
 
<P>
Use Snapshot Viewer to view, print, and electronically mail a report
snapshot file (.snp extension). A report snapshot file contains a high-
fidelity copy of each page of a Microsoft Access report, and preserves the
two-dimensional layout, graphics, and other embedded objects of the report.
Use Microsoft Access 97 Service Release 1 (SR-1) to create a report
snapshot. You can also view, print, store, publish, distribute, and archive
a report snapshot without having Microsoft Access by using Snapshot Viewer
with other programs such as an electronic mail program, Windows Explorer,
or a Web browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer.
<P>
<P><h3>Updated ValuPack Items</h3>
 
<P>
The following list contains items that have been updated since the original
release of the ValuPack. The ValuPack included with Microsoft Office SR-1
contains the latest version of the following items:
<P>
<PRE>   Avery Wizard

   Lotus cc:Mail Information Service
   Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.02
