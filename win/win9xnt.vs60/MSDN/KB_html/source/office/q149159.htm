The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform a post-administrative Setup of Microsoft Office for
Windows 95, version 7.0, on a computer that is running shared Windows 95,
the file Vredir.vxd is not updated correctly, and the following message
appears:
<P>
<PRE>   An error occurred while trying to install the following file: &lt;folder
   name&gt;\vredir.vxd

</PRE>where &lt;folder name&gt; is the path to the System folder in the folder that
contains the administrative installation of Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a post-administrative installation of Office 7.0 on a computer
that is running shared Windows 95, Setup cannot shut down Windows 95 and
update Vredir.vxd.
<P>
Note that on a computer running a local installation of Windows 95, the
Setup program restarts Windows 95 in order to update files that are already
in use by Windows 95; that is, the Setup program replaces or updates files
such as Vredir.vxd upon restarting the computer.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, ask your System Administrator to copy
Vredir.vxd from an existing local installation of Office 7.0 to the
administrative Windows 95 installation folder on the server. For example,
if the administrative Windows installation is in the \\Servername\Netsetup
folder, then copy the new Vredir.vxd file to the System\Vmm32 subfolder.
Then run the Office Setup program again.
<P>
The System Administrator must verify that no one is running shared Windows
before he or she copies the Vredir.vxd file to the server.
<P>
Vredir.vxd can be found on a computer that has an existing local
installation of Office 7.0. This file is located in the Windows\System
folder.
<P>
NOTE: The older version of the Vredir.vxd file is dated 07-11-1995 and has
a file size of 140,343 bytes. The version number is 4.00.950. The newer
Vredir.vxd file is 140,367 bytes in size, and is version 4.00.955.
<P>
After your System Administrator copies the file to the shared Windows
folder, subsequent post-administrative installations use the updated
Vredir.vxd file.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article.
