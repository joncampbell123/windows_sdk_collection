<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Office for Windows 95 Resource Kit (ORK) is an add-on product
for Microsoft Office for Windows 95. It provides the information that a
Management Information Systems (MIS) professional or administrator needs to
roll out and support Microsoft Office version 7.0.
<P>
The ORK also contains some utilities for allowing users of Microsoft Office
for the Macintosh versions 4.2 and later to open files created by the
Microsoft Office for Windows version 7.0 programs. This article outlines
all of the different programs on the ORK that allow this cross-platform
functionality.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

</PRE><h2>DESCRIPTIONS OF UTILITIES INCLUDED IN THE KIT</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Coexist\mac\unbind</h3>
 
<P>
This folder contains a Macintosh utility that separates a Microsoft Office
for Windows 95 binder file into its component files. The utility allows you
to open Microsoft Excel, Word, and PowerPoint for Windows 95 component
files in Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, versions 4.2 or later, or in
standalone versions of the Microsoft Office for the Macintosh programs.
Note, once your PowerPoint file has been separated from the Binder file,
you still may not be able to open it on your Macintosh. In order to open a
PowerPoint for Windows 95 file on your Macintosh, you first need to have
the appropriate translator installed on your Macintosh.
<P>
To set up the Unbind utility, copy Unbind.hqx to a Macintosh computer and
decompress the file using the BinHex version 4.0 or 5.0 utility.
<P>

</PRE><h3>Convert\Mac\Powerpnt</h3>
 
<P>
This folder contains a converter that allows Microsoft PowerPoint for the
Macintosh, version 4.0, to read files created by Microsoft PowerPoint for
Windows 95, version 7.0.
<P>
To set up the converter, copy Pp7trans.hqx to a Macintosh computer and
decompress the file using either the BinHex version 4.0 or 5.0 utility.
Note, the translator contained in the ORK is only for 68K Macintosh
computers. If you have a Power Macintosh computer and you need to open
PowerPoint version 7.0 files, you need to get the Power Macintosh version
of the translator.
