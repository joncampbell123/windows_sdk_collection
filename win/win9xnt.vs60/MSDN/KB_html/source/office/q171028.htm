<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform a "Run from Network Server" (RNS) installation of
Microsoft Office 97, the following error message appears
<P>
<PRE>   Setup could not open the file &lt;file name&gt;.

</PRE>where &lt;file name&gt; is a file that the Setup program is attempting to copy
from the server to your workstation.
<P>
When you click Retry, Setup continues but pauses again, and the same error
message appears with a different file name.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you are running virus protection software on the
network server.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Before running the Setup program, disable any virus protection software.
See the virus protection documentation for information about doing this.
After you run the Setup program, you can enable the virus-scanning software
and restart the computer.
