If you have a license to install Microsoft Office on more than
one client computer, there are two ways you can install Office in
your organization. You can distribute the Office disks to each
end user or you can install Office on a network and have each end
user install from there. The information in this file explains
the second option.
<P>
For late-breaking information relevant to all Microsoft Office 97
products, see the Office 97 readme file OfRead8.txt.

</PRE><h2>INSTALLING MICROSOFT OFFICE ON A NETWORK</h2>
 
<P>
Installing Office over the network is a two step process:

<OL><P><LI>The administrator creates the administrative installation point by
   creating the set of folders that will hold all the Office software
   and from which client installations will be done.

<P><LI>Users install Office by running Setup from the administrative
   installation point.
<P>
</OL>The same Setup.exe is used for each of these steps, although in
two different modes. To avoid confusion in the discussion below,
these two modes will be referred to as follows:
<P>
<PRE> * Administrative Setup
     - To create the administrative installation point, you run
       Setup.exe from the physical media with the /a command line
       option.

 * Client Setup
     - To perform a client installation, a user runs Setup.exe from the
       administrative installation point without the /a command line
       option.

</PRE></OL><h3>Disable Virus Protection before running Setup</h3>
 
<P>
Some virus protection programs, such as VSAFE.COM and Norton Anti-
Virus Autoprotect, can interfere with the Microsoft Office 97
Setup program. If you use a virus protection program on your
computer, please disable it before running Setup. (You can re-
enable the virus protection program after Setup is complete.)
Note -- If your virus-detection program starts automatically when
you start Windows, you can disable it by restarting Windows while
holding down the SHIFT key.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating the administrative installation point</h3>
 
<P>
You need to run administrative Setup under Windows 95, Windows NT
3.51 (or later), or Windows NT Advanced Server 3.51 (or later).
<P>
The administrative installation point must have at least 320MB of
disk space, and you (the administrator) must have read, write,
delete, and create permission to this location. Users need read
access as well. If your users will be running in a shared Windows
environment, you need to run Setup in that same environment and
you need write and create permissions to the Windows folders.
<P>
Using the administrative mode of Setup, you need to install all
of the Office files from the CD to the administrative
installation point. This consists of two primary folders which
will be created by Setup:

<OL><P><LI>\Msoffice - The main Office application files, such as Microsoft
   Word and Microsoft Excel will be installed in this folder.

<P><LI>\Msapps - Shared components, such as Art Gallery and Word Art, will
   be installed in this folder.
<P>
</OL><h3>Administrative installation</h3>
 
<P>
Before doing the administrative installation of Office, make
sure:

<UL><LI>Destination folders are empty. If a previous version of Office
   exists, delete all of it.

<LI>Users sharing applications or running shared Windows from this
   server are logged off.

<LI>Folders are locked to network user access during administrative
   installation.

<LI>Virus detection software is disabled.
<P>
</UL>To install Office on the administrative installation point:

<OL><P><LI>Run Setup.exe from the CD with the command line option /a:
   "setup.exe /a". Setup.exe must be run from a workstation with write
   access to the server, not directly on the server itself.
<P>
   NOTE: Double-clicking on Setup.exe in the File Manager (Windows
   NT Workstation 3.51) or Explorer (Windows 95 or Windows NT
   Workstation 4.0) will not work. You need to use the Run command
   on the File menu of Program Manager or File Manager (Windows NT
   Workstation 3.51), or the Run command in the Start menu (Windows
   95 or Windows NT Workstation 4.0) to use the command line option
   /a. If you double-click on Setup.exe it will perform a client
   installation.

<P><LI>Follow the instructions on the screen.
<P>
</OL>NOTES:

<UL><LI>The organization name you enter will be used for all client
   installations of Office from this network location.

<LI>When asked for the server and path for the shared applications
   folder, enter the name in the same way that users will specify
   it when installing Office. You can specify whether the server
   will be accessed by users with a drive letter (for example,
   G:\) or a UNC path (for example, \\server\share). If you
   select drive letter, users installing Office will need to have
   that drive letter mapped to this folder before running client
   Setup.

<LI>When Setup asks where you want the shared application files
   installed, the option you select controls the choices your
   users will have during client Setup:
<P>
<P><PRE>     + Server.............The shared application files will remain on
<PRE></PRE>                          the server and run remotely; the user won't
                          get a choice during client Setup.
     + Local Hard Drive...The shared application files will be copied
                          to the user's local hard drive; the user
                          won't get a choice during client Setup.
     + User's Choice......The user will be asked to choose Server or
                          Local Hard Drive during client Setup.

</PRE></OL>Setup then copies all files from the CD or floppy disks to the
administrative installation point.
<P>
After the installation is complete, share the two folders
(\Msoffice and \Msapps) on the network, either creating a single
share that contains both folders, or creating two separate
shares, one for each folder.
<P>
<P><h3>Client installation</h3>
 
<P>
To install Office on the client computers, users will:

<OL><P><LI>Connect to the main Office folder on the administrative
   installation point.

<P><LI>Run Setup.exe.
<P>
</OL>When users run client Setup from this administrative installation
point, they will see the Run From Network Server option in
addition to the other installation options. If a user selects
this option, the main Office application files are left on the
server and run remotely.
<P>
It is recommended that users have a read-only connection to the
server Office folder when they are running Setup, and also when
they are running the applications after a Run From Network Server
installation.
<P>
<P><h2>INSTALLATION ISSUES</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Office in Shared Windows for the First Time</h3>
 
<P>
The first time Office is installed to a user's computer in a
shared Windows environment, Setup will attempt to copy a few
Office files into the shared Windows folder. Although users
normally have read-only access to the shared Windows folder, the
first and second client installations of Office do require write
access to copy these files.
<P>
The first installation should be an administrative installation
The second installation should be a post-administrative
installation to the Shared Windows workstation. Both of these
installations require write access to the Shared Windows directory
on the server.
<P>
After the first and second installations are completed, the first
user's access rights to the shared Windows folder can be set back
to read-only. Subsequent users installing Office need only read-only
access to the Windows folder since the needed files will already
be present and Setup won't attempt to copy them again.
<P>
To correctly install Office 97 in a shared Windows environment,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Setup a shared Windows client that has full access privileges
   to the shared Windows server.

<P><LI>From this client perform an administrative install (Setup /a)
   to any server.  Setup may display the following error: "Setup
   could not open the file: c:\Windows\System\OLE32.DLL. It is in
   use by another application."  To complete the administrative
   install, click "Ignore" in the error message dialog box.

<P><LI>Regardless of whether or not you received the ole32.dll error
   you will need to manually copy these files from the CD to the
   shared Windows\system folder:
<P>
<PRE>    D:\Office\WMS\Common\ole32.dll   C:\Windows\System\ole32.dll
    D:\Office\WMS\Win95\mapi32.dll   C:\Windows\System\mapi32.dll
    D:\Office\WMS\Win95\mapisrvr.exe C:\Windows\System\mapisrvr.exe
    D:\Office\WMS\Win95\mdisp32.exe  C:\Windows\System\mdisp32.exe
    D:\Office\WMS\Win95\mdisp32.tlb  C:\Windows\System\mdisp32.tlb
    D:\Office\WMS\Win95\mspst32.dll  C:\Windows\System\mspst32.dll
    D:\Office\WMS\Win95\cmc.dll      C:\Windows\System\cmc.dll
    D:\Office\WMS\Win95\mapi.dll     C:\Windows\System\mapi.dll
    D:\Office\WMS\Common\wmsui32.dll C:\Windows\System\wmsui32.dll

   Where D: is the CD-ROM drive and C: is the drive containing the
   shared Windows\system folder.

</PRE><P><LI>From the same client, perform a post-administrative run from
   network server installation of Office.

<P><LI>Once setup is complete launch Word or Excel and press Alt-F11 to
   properly install VBA.

<P><LI>After the above steps are completed other users with read-only
   privileges to the shared Windows folder may perform their own
   Office 97 installations.
<P>
</OL><h3>Generic Icons Appear If Not Logged On Automatically</h3>
 
<P>
If you install Office using the Run From Network Server
installation option, but your computer is not configured to log
on to the server automatically at bootup, the program icons in
the Start menu will appear as generic icons, not as the normal
Office icons. The standard Office icons are only displayed if the
computer logs on to the server at bootup. If you log on to the
server after bootup, the generic icons are not replaced with the
standard Office icons.
<P>
Only the icon images are incorrect, the icons function correctly:
if you click an icon, after logging on to the server, it will run
the correct program.
<P>
<P><h3>Changing the Office Server Name After Installing VBA</h3>
 
<P>
If you run the shared components of Office from a network server,
and you connect to the server using a drive letter, Visual Basic
for Applications (VBA) will not run if you rename the server
share. Even though you specify a drive letter to the server, VBA
resolves this to a server name - if you change the name of the
server after installation, VBA will be unable to find the shared
components.
<P>
To address this situation, the Office 97 Resource Kit Tools and
Utilities includes the Windows System Policy template file
TypeLib.adm. By using this template to set the appropriate system
policies after you have renamed the server, you can reset
multiple user computers at the same time to use the correct new
server name. You must leave the policy in place because VBA
resets the server name each time VBA is run.
<P>
For information on how to obtain the Office 97 Resource Kit, see
"For More Information" at the end of this file.
<P>
To use the TypeLib.adm template file:

<OL><P><LI>Run the Windows System Policy Editor.

<P><LI>In the Options menu, click Policy Template.

<P><LI>Click Add and enter the template file path and name. For the
   location of this file in the Office 97 Resource Kit Tools and
   Utilities, see Appendix A, "Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit Tools
   and Utilities," of the Resource Kit.

<P><LI>In the File menu, click New Policy to create a new policy file, or
   click Open Policy to modify an existing policy file.

<P><LI>Double-click the Default Computer icon.

<P><LI>Select Re-register TypeLibs.

<P><LI>If you installed Office using the Run From Network Server
   installation type, set both the MSAPPS Path and ADMINROOT Path
   policies. If you installed Office locally but are using shared
   components on a network server, then set only the MSAPPS Path
   policy.

<P><LI>Each policy consists of a set of paths for TypeLib DLL files and
   their associated help files. Modify the paths to include the
   correct drive letter and path for your server.

<P><LI>Save the policy file and place it on the appropriate network server
   location. For more information on how to use system policies, see
   Chapter 7, "Customizing and Optimizing Microsoft Office," in the
   Office 97 Resource Kit.
<P>
</OL><h3>Using Power Management with Run From Network Server Installation</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using advanced power management software on a computer
with Office installed using a Run From Network Server
installation, Office applications may fail if the computer goes
into suspend mode and then starts again. Make sure all Office
applications are closed before suspending the computer.
<P>
<P><h3>Administrative Setup Doesn't Copy Getting Results Art Files</h3>
 
<P>
The following files are not copied to the administrative
installation point during an administrative installation. These
files are used by Results97.html, the Web page that allows users
to go to "Getting Results with Microsoft Office 97" on the World-
Wide Web. The Web page is functional, but the pictures will not
be visible without these files.
<P>
To give users access to these files, you need to copy them
manually as shown to the Office server.
<P>
<PRE> Copy from Office CD           To Office Server
 -------------------           ----------------

 D:\Cdonline\Art\Home_efc.gif  E:\Msoffice\Cdonline\Art\Home_efc.gif
 D:\Cdonline\Art\Homemsft.gif  E:\Msoffice\Cdonline\Art\Homemsft.gif
 D:\Cdonline\Art\Name.gif      E:\Msoffice\Cdonline\Art\Name.gif
 D:\Cdonline\Art\Navigate.gif  E:\Msoffice\Cdonline\Art\Navigate.gif

</PRE></OL>Where D: is the CD-ROM drive and E: is the server on which you
created the administrative installation point. You will need to
create the Art folder on the Office server.
<P>
<P><h3>Extra Local Files Installed in Run From Network Server</h3>
 
<P>
When you install Office with a Run From Network Server
installation, some files are installed on the hard disk that are
not needed by Office 97 or that are duplicates of files available
on the Office server. As described below, you may be able to
delete these files to conserve local hard disk space on the
user's compute.

<UL><LI>If you intend for the user to use Outlook for e-mail and not
   use Microsoft Exchange Client, then you can safely delete the
   following files from the Windows\Form\Config folder after
   installing Office:
<P>
<P><PRE>     MAPIF0.CFG
     MAPIF0L.ICO
     MAPIF0S.ICO
     MAPIF1.CFG
     MAPIF1L.ICO
     MAPIF1S.ICO
     MAPIF2.CFG
     MAPIF2L.ICO
     MAPIF2S.ICO
     MAPIF3.CFG
     MAPIF3L.ICO
     MAPIF3S.ICO
     MAPIF4.CFG
     MAPIF4L.ICO
     MAPIF4S.ICO
     MAPIF5.CFG
     MAPIF5L.ICO
     MAPIF5S.ICO
</PRE>
<LI>The following files are accessed from the server and are not
   needed on the local hard disk. They may be deleted from the
   local Windows folder after installing Office:
<P>
<P><PRE>     twain.dll
     twunk_16.exe
     twunk_32.exe
     twain_32.dll
</PRE><P>
</UL><h3>Use Drive Letter on Banyan Vines Network</h3>
 
<P>
If you are installing office on a Banyan Vines network using the
Run From Network Server installation type, or if Office
components are shared on a network server, then you should use a
drive letter to specify the location of the server during
administrative installation rather than a Universal Naming
Convention (UNC) path. The network UNC path used in a Banyan
Vines network may pose difficulties to Office applications
accessing the server. For this reason, Microsoft recommends that
you use a drive letter to specify the location of the Office
server during administrative installation.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Office on a Banyan Vines Server</h3>
 
<P>
If you are running Office 97 Setup from Windows NT Workstation,
version 3.51 or later, using the Banyan Vines network client, you
will not be able to install Office on a Banyan Vines server. This
includes both an administrative installation on the server (Setup
/a), and a client installation to run Office from the server. In
each case, Setup displays an error saying that a filename is
invalid and Setup terminates.
<P>
The Banyan Vines network client for Windows 95 is able to write
to the Banyan Vines server successfully, so you can install
Office on a Banyan Vines server by running Setup  (with the /a
option) on a Windows 95 computer using the Banyan Vines network
client. Alternatively, you can run Setup (with the /a option) to
another, non-Vines server, and then copy the folders manually to
the Vines server.
<P>
<P><h2>FOR MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Only the basic installation information has been described here.
For more details, including how to customize a network
installation for your specific needs, you should obtain a copy of
the "Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit."
<P>
The Resource Kit is designed to help you successfully roll out
and support Office 97 and its component applications in your
organization. It includes information such as the architecture of
Office applications, detailed information about the installation
process and tools you use to customize this process, maintenance
and support information including frequently asked questions and
troubleshooting tips, information on how to use Office in a
workgroup, and how to switch from other applications. There is
also a CD-ROM with valuable tools and utilities, including an
electronic copy of the book itself. Look for Microsoft Office 97
Resource Kit at your local bookseller's.
