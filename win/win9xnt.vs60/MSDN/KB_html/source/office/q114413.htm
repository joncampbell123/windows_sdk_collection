The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office Assistant for Windows, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you open a file by clicking the filename in the Microsoft Office
Assistant, you receive the following error message if the file is already
open:
<P>
<PRE>   Sharing violation on drive C

</PRE>Note that this behavior does not occur when you click on a Microsoft
PowerPoint presentation (.PPT), or a Microsoft Excel template (.XLT)
file. The problem only occurs when you click on a Microsoft Word
document (.DOC) or template (.DOT), a Microsoft Excel workbook (.XLS)
or a Microsoft Access database (.MDB) file when that file is already
open.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message appears if either of the following is true:

<UL><LI>You are using 32-Bit File Access in Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
   version 3.11
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>You are loading the Share program SHARE.EXE in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To switch to a file included in the Microsoft Office Assistant, when
the file is already open, do any of the following:
<P>
<P><h3>WORKAROUND 1</h3>
 
<P>
If you are using 32-Bit File Access in Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11, you can turn this option off with the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Run the Control Panel.

<P><LI>Choose the Enhanced icon.

<P><LI>Choose the Virtual Memory button, and then choose the Change button.

<P><LI>Clear the Use 32-Bit File Access check box, and choose OK.

<P><LI>Choose Yes to make changes to virtual-memory settings.

<P><LI>Choose Restart Computer so that the changes that you made will take
   effect.
<P>
</OL>Note that when you use this workaround, you may notice that some
tasks on your system take longer than when you were using 32-Bit File
Access.
<P>
<P><h3>WORKAROUND 2</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Windows version 3.1, if you are loading the SHARE.EXE
file in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, and your system is capable of running
Microsoft Windows in 386 Enhanced Mode, you can use an equivalent of
the Share program, VSHARE.386. If you are running Windows 3.1, the
file VSHARE.386 is included with the "VSHARE.386 for Windows"
(WW1000) application note.
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article(s) in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win3x/q112025.htm">Q112025</A></B>
   TITLE     : WW1000: VSHARE.386 for Windows

</PRE></OL>If you are running Windows for Workgroups 3.1 or 3.11 in 386 enhanced
mode, you should already be using VSHARE.386.
<P>
<P><h3>WORKAROUND 3</h3>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving this error message without making the above
changes to your system, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Use the Task List to switch to the application in which the file is open
   to access the file instead of clicking on the file name in the Microsoft
   Office Assistant.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Double-click the name of the file that you want to switch to in the
   Windows File Manager to activate the file that is already open. When
   you use this workaround with a Microsoft Access database, the database
   file is opened in a second instance of Microsoft Access.
<P>
</UL>Note that the error message does not prevent you from accessing the
selected file. If you choose Cancel in the dialog box that contains
the error message, the file that you clicked in the Microsoft Office
Assistant is activated. Or, if the selected file is a Microsoft Word
template, a new document based on this template is created.
