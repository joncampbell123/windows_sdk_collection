The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start any of the products listed at the beginning of this article,
you may receive one of the following error messages or problems:
<P>
<PRE>   Program Error, Call to Undefined Dynalink

      -or-

   The server Program, source file, or item cannot be found. Make sure
   the Program is properly installed, and it has not been deleted,
   moved, or renamed.

      -or-

   This Program requires a newer version of Windows.

      -or-

   Sorry, PowerPoint cannot locate one of its components.

      -or-

   The mouse cursor changes into an hourglass, then changes back into an
   arrow and program does not start.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when a program attempts to access a dynamic link
library (DLL) file that is outdated, is an incorrect version, is missing,
or is damaged. When this occurs, the OLE Linking and Embedding files are
mismatched or are the incorrect versions. Note that programs from third-
party vendors may install different versions of some or all of these OLE
files and replace the existing OLE files. When this occurs, the error
messages listed in this article may appear.
<P>
This problem commonly occurs when the following OLE files are mismatched
or are the incorrect versions:
<P>
<PRE>   compobj.dll
   ole2.dll
   ole2.reg
   ole2conv.dll
   ole2disp.dll
   ole2nls.dll
   ole2prox.dll
   stdole.tlb
   storage.dll
   typelib.dll

</PRE>Note: The files listed above are in the Windows\System folder.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, replace the affected OLE files. To do this, use
one of the methods in this section.
<P>
NOTE: The following methods do not correct every problem that causes the
error messages to appear; however, they do correct common causes of the
error messages.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Reinstall the Program</h3>
 
<P>
The easiest way to replace the files listed in this article is to rename
them, and then reinstall the program. To do this, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Quit all open programs and close any toolbars.

<P><LI>Rename the files that are listed in the "Cause" section.
<P>
   For more information about how to rename files in Windows, see your
   Windows printed documentation or online Help.

<P><LI>Run the Setup program in maintenance mode for the program that you want
   to reinstall and click Reinstall when the dialog box appears. Note that
   this step requires that you have your installation disks or compact
   disc.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Copy New Files from the System Backup Folder</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: Use this method only if you use Microsoft Windows 95.
<P>
Microsoft Windows 95 stores backup copies of integral system DLL files in
the Sysbckup folder. You can copy the OLE files from the system backup
directory. To do this, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Quit all open programs and close any toolbars.

<P><LI>Rename the files that are listed in the "Cause" section.
<P>
   For more information about how to rename files in Windows, see your
   Windows printed documentation or online Help.

<P><LI>Copy the files that are listed in the "Cause" section from the
   Windows\Sysbckup folder to the Windows\System folder.
<P>
   NOTE: The Sysbckup folder is a hidden folder. To see this folder, you
   must select "Show all files" in Windows Explorer. (In Windows Explorer,
   click Options on the View menu, click the View tab, click "Show all
   files" and click OK.)
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 3: Install the Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: Use this method only if you use Microsoft Office 4.2 or 4.3.
<P>
A quick way to reinstall the OLE files is to install the PowerPoint Viewer
program that comes with Microsoft Office 4.2 or 4.3. When you run Setup,
the PowerPoint Viewer also copies the files that are listed in the "Cause"
section. To install the PowerPoint Viewer, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Quit all open programs and close any toolbars.

<P><LI>Rename the files that are listed in the "Cause" section.
<P>
   For more information about how to rename files in Windows, see your
   Windows printed documentation or online Help.

<P><LI>If you are using a version of Microsoft Office that is on disks, insert
   the PowerPoint Viewer disk (usually the last disk) into the appropriate
   floppy disk drive and double-click Vsetup.exe to run it. If you are
   using a version of Microsoft Office 4.2 that is on a compact disc, run
   the Vsetup.exe file in the Setup.adm\Disk25 folder. If you are using
   Microsoft Office Professional, version 4.3, run the Vsetup.exe file in
   the Setup.adm\Disk31 folder.
<P>
   NOTE: The PowerPoint Viewer is not available when you perform a network
   installation of Microsoft Office. To use this method with a copy of
   Microsoft Office that you installed from a network, you must have
   Access to the PowerPoint Viewer disk or a Microsoft Office compact
   disc.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 4: Obtain Updated OLE Files</h3>
 
<P>
For information about obtaining updated OLE files, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win3x/q123087.htm">Q123087</A></B>
   TITLE     : WW1116: OLE Version 2.03

</PRE></OL><h3>Method 5: Decompress or Extract the OLE Files</h3>
 
<P>
This method involves manually decompressing or extracting the required OLE
files from the original installation media. Use the extract utility
(Extract.exe) or the decompression utility (Decomp.exe) that is included
with the program to decompress the correct files to the Windows\System
folder. For the versions of Office that come on disks, these utilities are
normally located on disk 1. For the version of Office that comes on compact
disc, the utilities are located in the Setup.Adm\Disk1 folder.
<P>
NOTE: The files for some versions of Office that comes on compact disc are
not compressed. A compressed file uses an underscore character as the last
character in the file name extension. For example, a compressed version of
the Compobj.dll file is Compobj.dl_. If the file does not contain an
underscore character, it is not compressed. If the files are not
compressed, you can copy them directly from the compact disc to the
Windows\System folder.
<P>
The following tables list the locations of the OLE files based on which
version of each program you use. Below the tables are instructions for
extracting the files to the local hard disk.

<P><LI>Copy Decomp.exe to the root directory of the local hard disk, or to a
   folder that is located on the PATH statement of your Autoexec.bat file.

<P><LI>Insert the Setup disk that contains the OLE files. At the MS-DOS
   command prompt, type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      decomp &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;compressedname&gt; &lt;windows&gt;\system\&lt;filename&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive that contains the Setup disk,
   &lt;compressedname&gt; is the name of the compressed file, &lt;windows&gt; is your
   Microsoft Windows directory (usually C:\Windows), and &lt;filename&gt; is the
   name of the file after you decompress it.
