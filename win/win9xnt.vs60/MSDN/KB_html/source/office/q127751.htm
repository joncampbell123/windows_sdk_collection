The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.3c-CD
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you install the Microsoft Video for Windows bonus software from
Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.3c-CD, the media collections that
are normally present with Video for Windows will not be included. The Media
Browser application (which is installed as part of Video for Windows)
references these missing collections.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can install Video for Windows from the BONUS\WINVIDEO subdirectory of
Disk 1: Installation Disk of Microsoft Office version 4.3c-CD. When it is
installed, it installs "Media Browser" in the Accessories group
<P>
Media Browser lets you find and play several types of media files from
predefined groups of files called collections. Media files can include
several types of data including Digital video, Digital sound, MIDI, and
Pictures.
<P>
Collections are predefined groups of files on a CD or on your hard disk.
Each collection can include several types of files, such as video, sound,
animation, MIDI, or graphics. In the Collections list, each collection is
represented by an icon. Video for Windows creates 18 collections. These can
easily be identified because they start with "Video for Windows 1.1" on the
first line of the collection name. If you double-click one of these
collections, you will receive the message
<P>
<PRE>   Please insert the Video for Windows 1.1 CD-ROM to open the collection

</PRE>These collections are not on either of the two Microsoft Office CDs. They
can only be found on the Video for Windows 1.1 CD-ROM. The only resolution
is to choose Cancel and select each of these collections and remove them by
choosing the Remove Collection button.
<P>
NOTE: The Video for Windows bonus software that is included in Microsoft
Office for Windows, version 4.3c-CD, is not the run-time version. It is the
fully functional version 1.1.
