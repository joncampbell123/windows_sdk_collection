The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you click the Browse button for the "Named location in file (optional)"
edit box in the Insert Hyperlink dialog box, you may receive the following
error:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Excel either could not connect to the file you specified, or
   the file is not a Microsoft Excel workbook. Please verify that:

   - The path or URL and the file name are correct.
   - You can connect to the file from your Web browser.
   - The file is a Microsoft Excel workbook. If the file is an Office file,
     and you know the location you want, such as a Word bookmark or a
     PowerPoint slide, type the location in the Named Location In File box.
   - If you don't know the location, leave the Named Location In File box
     blank, and your hyperlink will jump to the file.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive this error message if all of the following are true:

<UL><LI>The workbook in which you are creating the hyperlink is embedded in a
   Word document.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You try to browse to a named location in a Microsoft Excel workbook.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You are trying to browse to a named location in the same embedded
   workbook.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You will not be able to browse to a named location in the active workbook
if the workbook is embedded in a Word document. In order to create a
hyperlink to a named location in the active embedded workbook, you will
have to manually enter the named location in the "Named location in file
(optional)" edit box.
<P>
For example, if you have two worksheets, Sheet1 and Sheet2, in your
embedded workbook, and you want to create a hyperlink to a defined name,
"myrange" (referring to cell A1 in Sheet2), in cell A1 of Sheet1, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Select cell A1 in Sheet1.

<P><LI>On the Insert menu, click Hyperlink.

<P><LI>In the Insert Hyperlink dialog box, type "myrange" (without the
   quotation marks) in the "Named location in file (optional)" edit box.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If your workbook is not embedded in a Word document and you click the
Browse button for the "Named location in file (optional)" edit box, the
Browse Excel Workbook dialog box will appear. In this dialog box, all the
worksheets in the workbook will be listed and there is an option button for
Defined Name. When you click the Defined Name button, all the defined names
in the workbook are displayed in the list below the button. If you click
any of the defined names and then click OK, this defined name will be
entered in the "Named location in file (optional)" edit box.
