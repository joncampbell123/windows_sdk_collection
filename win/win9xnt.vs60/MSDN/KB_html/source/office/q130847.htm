<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office, the Microsoft Office Shortcut Bar may
be installed, depending on which version of Office you install and which
setup options you select. The Office Shortcut Bar provides convenient
toolbar shortcuts you can use to work with your documents and Office
programs.
<P>
The following information describes the Office Shortcut Bar in more
detail, describes features, and discusses how the Office Shortcut Bar
differs from the Microsoft Windows taskbar.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Office Shortcut Bar: Description and Features</h3>
 
<P>
The Office Shortcut Bar comes with the Office toolbar and several other
toolbars you can use to quickly complete many common tasks. For example,
you can use the Shortcut Bar to create and open documents, set up
appointments, connect to the Microsoft Network, send E-mail, and much
more.
<P>
The following is a list of additional features of the Office Shortcut
Bar:

<UL><LI>You can customize the Office Shortcut Bar toolbars so they display
   the toolbars and buttons that you need and hide the ones you don't.

<LI>You can add new buttons or toolbars for programs and documents
   you use frequently.

<LI>You can create new toolbars from scratch or from one of your own
   folders.

<LI>You can customize the appearance of the Office Shortcut Bar. For
   example, you can color-code your toolbars, turn ToolTips on or off,
   use large or small toolbar buttons, and choose whether to animate
   the toolbars or not.

<LI>The Office Shortcut Bar is always available, even when you maximize
   a document or program and cover your Windows desktop. You can drag
   your Shortcut Bar to dock it wherever you want it; either on the edge
   of your screen or floating as a window on your desktop. When you dock
   the Shortcut Bar along an edge of your screen, Windows resizes your
   desktop so the Shortcut Bar is outside the desktop and doesn't cover
   anything else on your desktop. You can also keep the Shortcut Bar on
   top of all the other windows on your desktop, hide it between uses,
   minimize it to the Windows taskbar, or nest it in the title bar of
   your maximized programs.

<LI>On a toolbar, you can move the buttons around so they are in the
   order you want. You can add spaces between groups of buttons to make
   it easy to locate the button you need.

<LI>You can change global settings that affect all your Office programs.
   For example, you can set a User or Workgroup Template location that
   all your Office programs use when you start a new document.

<LI>The Shortcut Bar opens only one toolbar at a time, so your desktop
   stays uncluttered. Closed toolbars appear as a single button on the
   Office Shortcut Bar. You can click a toolbar to open it when you need
   it. The ToolTip for each toolbar and button make it easy to find the
   one you want.

<LI>If you don't use a toolbar very frequently, you can keep it hidden
   until you need it, then right-click a blank area on a toolbar to
   redisplay it.
<P>
</UL><h3>Office Shortcut Bar Versus the Windows Taskbar</h3>
 
<P>
If an Office program is already running and you click its button on the
Office Shortcut Bar, Office switches to the program. For some programs,
such as Paint, Calculator, or Notepad, Office starts a second instance of
the program.
<P>
It is often easier to use the Windows taskbar to switch between running
programs. The taskbar shows you what is currently running so you can
quickly switch from one task to another. For details, see your Windows
documentation.
<P>
The Office Shortcut Bar complements the Windows taskbar and the Start
button. You can use the Office Shortcut Bar to create shortcuts to the
work you do most often. The Office Shortcut Bar is also handy when your
Windows desktop is covered by a maximized program. Use the Desktop button
on the Office Shortcut Bar to access your desktop so you don't have to
stop work and minimize your program.
<P>
Use the Windows Start button to switch between the documents and programs
that are currently open on your computer and to start programs for which
you do not have a Shortcut Bar button.
