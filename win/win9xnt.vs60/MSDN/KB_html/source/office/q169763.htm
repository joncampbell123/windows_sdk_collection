The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you view a worksheet section or chart section in Microsoft Office
Binder and you quit Microsoft Excel 97, you can no longer these sections.
Instead, you receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   The section is currently being viewed outside the binder.
   Double-click the icon above or click View Outside on the Section menu
   to view the section in the program used to create it.

</PRE>This problem does not occur with other kinds of sections, for example,
Microsoft Word documents or Microsoft PowerPoint presentations, or when you
use Microsoft Office Binder for Office 7.0.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>In Binder for Microsoft Office 97, you click View Outside to view a
   Microsoft Excel worksheet section or a Microsoft Excel chart section.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You close the section by clicking Quit on the File menu in Microsoft
   Excel 97.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do not click Exit on the File menu in
Microsoft Excel 97 when you are viewing a worksheet section or chart
section in a Binder. Instead, click "Close &amp; Return to Binder" on the File
menu. When you do this, the worksheet section or chart section appears
correctly in Binder for Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
If the problem already occurred, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>In Microsoft Office Binder, double-click the icon for the Microsoft
   Excel worksheet or chart section.
<P>
   The icon is located immediately above the message.

<P><LI>In Microsoft Excel 97, click "Close &amp; Return to &lt;BinderName&gt;" on the
   File menu, where &lt;BinderName&gt; is the name of your Binder file.
<P>
</OL>The worksheet section or chart section appears correctly in Microsoft
Office Binder.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Office Binder, you can view a section in its associated
program by switching to the section and clicking View Outside on the
Section menu. To return control to the binder, click "Close &amp; Return to
&lt;BinderName&gt;" on the File menu of the program.
<P>
If you click Exit on the File menu of the program, the program closes and
returns control of the section to Microsoft Office Binder so that the
section may be displayed properly in the Binder. The exception to this
behavior is Microsoft Excel 97. If you quit Microsoft Excel 97 while
viewing a worksheet or chart section, Microsoft Office Binder cannot
automatically reload Microsoft Excel 97 into random access memory. You may
not be able to view Microsoft Excel sections without first starting
Microsoft Excel 97.
