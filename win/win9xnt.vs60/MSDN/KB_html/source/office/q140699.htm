The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Office Resource Kit for Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, versions 4.2, 4.2.1, 4.2.1a
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for the Power Macintosh, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for the Macintosh, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you open a presentation created in Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95
version 7.0 in Microsoft PowerPoint for the Macintosh or for the Power
Macintosh, you may receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Sorry, this file is not a PowerPoint presentation

</PRE>and you will not be able to open your file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive this error message if you do not have the appropriate
translators installed on your Macintosh. Because the file format for
PowerPoint version 7.0 is different from the format for version 4.0 for the
Macintosh, you will need a translator to open a presentation created in a
version later than what you may have on your computer.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>PowerPoint for the Macintosh version 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Office Resource Kit for Windows 95 (ORK) contains several
translators and converters that allow you to use files that were created in
Microsoft Office for Windows 95 programs on your Macintosh. One of these
translators allows you to open presentations created in Microsoft
PowerPoint for Windows 95 version 7.0 in Microsoft PowerPoint for the
Macintosh version 4.0. To use the translator from the ORK on your
Macintosh, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the Pp7trans.hqx file from the Convert\Mac\PowerPnt folder on the
   ORK to a floppy disk.

<P><LI>Insert the floppy disk into the Macintosh disk drive.
<P>
   Note, you must have PC Exchange, or similar product installed on your
   Macintosh in order to successfully read this MS-DOS-formatted disk on
   your Macintosh.

<P><LI>On your Macintosh, start BinHex version 4.0 or 5.0.

<P><LI>When BinHex is started, click once on the introduction screen to go to
   the next step.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click "Upload -&gt; Application" (BinHex 4.0) or
   "Download -&gt; Application" (BinHex 5.0).

<P><LI>In the dialog box that appears, select the Pp7trans.hqx file located
   on the floppy disk, and then click Open.

<P><LI>In the next dialog box, click the Desktop button and save the document
   to the desktop with the name "Pp7trans."
<P>
   NOTE: If you don't change to the desktop, BinHex tries to save the
   file to the floppy disk; you want to have this file on your hard disk.

<P><LI>Click the Save button.
<P>
   NOTE: This file conversion process can take several minutes to complete.
   When it has completed, you should end up with a file called Pp7trans on
   your desktop.

<P><LI>Move the Pp7trans file to your PowerPoint folder on your Macintosh hard
   disk.
<P>
</OL>You should now be able to open a presentation created in PowerPoint for
Windows 95 version 7.0 either by double-clicking the icon for your file or
by opening it from within PowerPoint.
<P>
<P><h3>PowerPoint for the Power Macintosh version 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
You will not be able to use the Pp7trans translator version that comes with
the Office Resource Kit to open presentations created in Microsoft
PowerPoint version 7.0 for Windows 95 if you are using Microsoft PowerPoint
for the Power Macintosh version 4.0. In this case, you need to do the
following:

<UL><LI>Obtain the PowerPoint version 7.0 for Windows 95 Pp7trans.hqx file.
<P>
   The following file are available for download from the Microsoft
   Software Library:
<P>
 ~ <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/pp7trans.hqx">Pp7trans.hqx</A> <I>(size: 398400 bytes)</I>

    -or-

</PRE><LI>Open the presentation in version 7.0 and save the file as a version
   4.0 presentation.
<P>
<P><PRE>    1. Note, in order to save the file as a version 4.0 presentation, you
       must have PowerPoint Viewer installed on your computer, because it
       is the Viewer that actually saves the file out in the version 4.0
       format.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    2. Bring the version 4.0 presentation to your Power Macintosh and open
       the file.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    NOTE: This presentation will be opened as a read-only file because it
    was created on a platform other than a Macintosh. To be able remove the
    read-only status for this file, do the following:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    a. On the File Menu, click Save As.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    b. In the Save Presentation as box, type a new name.
