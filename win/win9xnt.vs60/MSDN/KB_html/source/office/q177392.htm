The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program, you may receive the
following error message multiple times:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup Error 947
   Network Log Location Object
   Your Setup files may be damaged. Try restarting the Setup program from
   where you originally ran it.

</PRE>Next, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup Error 723
   Setup was unable to read configuration information from the first
   section of the setup file: C:\~MSSETUP.T\~msstfof.t\Off97Pro.stf.

</PRE>Then, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Office 97 Setup was not completed successfully.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if you do all of the following:

<UL><LI>You use the Microsoft Office Network Installation Wizard to customize
   the installation of Microsoft Office.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>In the Network Installation Wizard, you specify a location that does not
   include the full path in the Network Log Location box, for example, you
   specify the following location for the log file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Installed.log
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Indicate the network server and share when you specify the location in
   the Network Log Location box.

<P><LI>Open the customized LST file in the Network Installation Wizard and
   change the location for the network log to include a fully qualified
   path for the log file.
<P>
   For example, the path to the log file should be similar to the following
<P>
<P><PRE>      \\&lt;server&gt;\&lt;share&gt;\Installed.log
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;server&gt; is the path to a valid server and &lt;share&gt; is the share
   location on that server. To successfully install Microsoft Office, the
   user who is performing the installation must have both read and write
   permissions to this share point.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Network Log Location box in the Network Installation Wizard should
indicate the location for the Network Install Log file that is used to
track the number of installations (and removals) from an administrative
installation point. This log file maintains information for the Office
administrator regarding the user name, computer, and the date on which
Office is installed on the workstation from the administrative point.
<P>
The Network Log file is different from the Setup Log file (which is
generated by adding the /g &lt;filename.log&gt; command-line parameter to the end
of the setup command line. The Setup Log generates a log file that records
details of the installation process on the workstation. For example, the
following command
<P>
<PRE>   O:\Off97\setup.exe /L custom\custom.lst /B2 /Q1 /G "C:\off97.log"

</PRE></OL>creates a Setup Log file named Off97.log in the root directory of drive C.
