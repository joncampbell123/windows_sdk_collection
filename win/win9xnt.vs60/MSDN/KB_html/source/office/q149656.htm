The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, versions 4.2.1a (compact disc),
   4.2.1b (compact disc)
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform an administrative installation of Microsoft Office for the
Macintosh from a compact disc, you may receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Please insert the next installation disk:
   Install Disk &lt;disk #&gt;

</PRE>and your only option is to click Cancel.
<P>
Then, you may receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   There is not enough memory available to continue execution of Setup. Try
   increasing Setup's memory partition, and then rerun Setup again.

</PRE>and your only option is to click Exit Setup.
<P>
Note that you may only receive the second error message, but the resolution
should be the same as if you received both error messages.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because the Setup program is out of memory, and you are
unable to change the memory allocation for the Setup program because you
are running Setup from a compact disc.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To workaround this issue, you can use either of the following methods:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Copy the Office files from the compact disc to your hard disk, and then run
Setup from your hard disk. Note that this requires roughly 110 megabytes
(MB) of free hard disk space on the workstation to which you are copying
the contents of the compact disc. To perform this workaround, use the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the contents of the compact disc to your hard disk.

<P><LI>Change the Preferred Size of the Microsoft Office Setup program
   from 2,950K to 4,000K.

<P><LI>Rerun Setup from the Microsoft Office Setup icon that is located in the
   Install Disk 1 folder that you copied to the hard disk.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Run the Setup using floppy disks instead of from a compact disc. Before you
run Setup from a floppy disk, change the Preferred Size of the Microsoft
Office Setup program (on Install Disk 1) from 2,950K to 4,000K.
<P>
NOTE: To perform an administrative installation, remember to hold down the
COMMAND key when you double-click the Microsoft Office Setup icon.
