The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT, version 3.51
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start File Manager in Windows NT 3.51 from the Office Shortcut
Bar, you may be able to see files in a folder (directory) to which you have
no permissions.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the following conditions are met:

<UL><LI>You log on to an NT File System (NTFS) in Windows NT as an
   administrator.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You create a folder and remove all users who have permission
   to access the folder.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You grant a user other than yourself all permissions to access the
   folder.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You add File Manager to the Office Shortcut Bar, and then you start File
   Manager by clicking the button on the Office Shortcut Bar.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You open the folder that you had previously created as the administrator
   to which you no longer have permissions.
<P>
</UL>This problem occurs because the Office Shortcut Bar enables backup and
restore permissions in order to write user settings in the registry. When
you start a program, such as File Manager, from the Office Shortcut Bar,
the program inherits the backup and restore permissions from the Office
Shortcut Bar and you are able to see files in a folder to which you do not
have permission.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Office versions 7.0a and 7.0b for Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you exercise backup and restore permissions, Windows NT allows you to
bypass file security to back up files.
