The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, version 4.2
<LI>Microsoft Office for the Power Macintosh, version 4.2
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 6.0
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for the Macintosh, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, or Microsoft PowerPoint,
after installing Microsoft Office Manager (MOM) included with Microsoft
Office, the application that you installed may not be added to MOM.
<P>
Additionally, when you install Microsoft Office for the Power Macintosh,
the Office applications that you installed may not appear on MOM.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if you do either of the following:

<UL><LI>You perform a workstation installation of one of these applications,
   after installing Microsoft Office Manager. This behavior occurs because
   MOM can't locate an application if it is not installed to your local
   hard drive, because the alias is not in the desktop database.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You install Microsoft Office for the Power Macintosh to a drive or
   partition on your computer that is not the startup disk. For example, if
   your computer has more than one hard drive, or has one large hard drive
   with multiple partitions, and you install Microsoft Office to the drive
   or partition that does not contain the System Folder, this behavior
   occurs.
<P>
</UL>If you perform a workstation installation of Microsoft Office, the
application aliases are copied to the Preferences folder in the System
Folder. The applications are then listed on MOM, because MOM uses these
aliases to locate the applications on the server instead of using the
desktop database file so that the appropriate network connections are used.
<P>
However, if you perform a workstation installation the individual Microsoft
Office application, the application does not appear on the MOM menu.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To add an application that you are running from a network server, or from a
drive or partition other than the startup disk, do the following:
<P>
<PRE>   1. From the MOM menu, choose Customize.

   2. Choose the New button.

   3. Choose the application file that you are running from the network
      server, and choose the Add button.

   4. Close the Microsoft Office Manager dialog box.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following applications are added to the MOM menu when you start
your computer if they are located in the desktop database file:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Creative Writer
   Microsoft Excel
   Microsoft Flight Simulator
   Microsoft FoxPro
   Microsoft Mail
   Microsoft PowerPoint
   Microsoft Project
   Microsoft Schedule+
   Microsoft Word
   Microsoft Works
