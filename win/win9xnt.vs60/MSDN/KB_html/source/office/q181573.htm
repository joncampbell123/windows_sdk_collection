The information in this article applies to:

<LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains how to install the additional Office Assistants that
are included in the Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition Value Pack.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition on your computer,
only one assistant, Max, is installed by default.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Additional Assistants</h3>
 
<P>
To install additional assistants, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Double-click the Value Pack Installer in the Value Pack folder to run
   it.

<P><LI>Click to select the Assistants check box if you want to install
   all the assistants. Otherwise, click the arrow (&gt;) next to Assistants,
   and click to select the check box for each assistant you want to
   install.

<P><LI>When you are finished selecting items you want to install, click
   Install.
<P>
</OL>You can also use a drag-and-drop procedure to install additional
assistants. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition compact disc into the
   CD-ROM drive.

<P><LI>Use the Finder to go to the Value Pack:Assistants folder on the compact
   disc.
<P>
   The following assistants are listed:
<P>
<PRE>      Bosgrove   Mother Nature
      Clippit    Power Pup
      Dot        Robot (a.k.a. "F1")
      Earl       Rocky
      Genius     Scribble
      Hoverbot   Will
      Logo

</PRE><P><LI>Drag the assistants that you want to install to the Desktop.

<P><LI>Use the Finder to open the following folder on the hard disk on your
   computer:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Office 98:Office:Assistants
</PRE>
<P><LI>Drag the assistants from the Desktop to the Assistants folder.
<P>
</OL>The additional assistants are available in the programs included in
Microsoft Office 98.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Aliases to Additional Assistants</h3>
 
<P>
All together, the additional assistants use almost 20 megabytes (MB) of
hard disk space. If there is not enough free hard disk space on your
computer, you can use aliases that allow you to use assistants without
actually copying them onto the hard disk. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition compact disc.

<P><LI>Use the Finder to go to the Value Pack:Assistants folder on the compact
   disc.

<P><LI>Select the assistant for which you want to create an alias. Then,
   click Make Alias on the File menu. When you receive an error message,
   click OK to create the alias on the Desktop.
<P>
   Repeat this step for each assistant for which you want to create an
   alias.

<P><LI>Use the Finder to open the following folder on the hard disk on your
   computer:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Office 98:Office:Assistants
</PRE>
<P><LI>Drag the aliases from the Desktop to the Assistants folder.
<P>
</OL>The additional assistants are available in the programs included in
Microsoft Office 98.
<P>
IMPORTANT: The location in which the assistant files are actually stored
must be available in order for you to use them. Therefore, if the
assistants are stored on your Microsoft Office 98 compact disc, the compact
disc must be in the CD-ROM drive when you use the assistants; otherwise,
the assistants do not work. Similarly, if the assistants are stored on a
network server, you must be connected to the server to use them.
<P>
<P><h3>Performing an Administrative Installation of Additional Assistants</h3>
 
<P>
If you perform an administrative installation of Microsoft Office 98, you
can automatically install additional assistants for network users to
install by dragging the assistant files from the Microsoft Office 98
compact disc into the Assistants folder on the network server.
<P>
You can include additional assistants in an administrative installation of
Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition by following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Perform the administrative installation of Microsoft Office 98, either
   by dragging the Microsoft Office 98 folder on the compact disc to the
   network server or by running the Microsoft Office Installer program and
   specifying a folder on the network server as the destination folder.

<P><LI>Drag the additional assistant files from the Microsoft Office 98
   compact disc to the Assistants folder on the network server.
<P>
</OL>When users drag the Microsoft Office 98 folder from the network server to
the workstation computer, the additional assistants are included in the
installation and are available in each program.
<P>
NOTE: If a user installs Microsoft Office 98 by running the Microsoft
Office Installer program, the additional assistants are not installed on
the computer. If this occurs, you must provide the user with manual
instructions for installing the additional assistants.
