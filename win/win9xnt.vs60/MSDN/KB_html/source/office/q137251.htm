<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you add a large number of sections (more than 30) to a Binder in
Microsoft Office Binder, you may receive an "Out of Memory" error message
or another similar memory error message.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There is no "set" limit for the number of sections that you can add before
you receive the "Out of Memory" error message. The number depends on
available system resources and actual memory constraints of the computer on
which Microsoft Binder is running.
<P>
When you add a section to a Binder, if the program that you use to create
the section is not already running, an invisible instance of the program is
started. If the program is already running (visible or invisible), this
instance is used instead of starting a new instance. Each additional
section that you add uses system resources, fewer resources are used if the
program is already running.
<P>
Note that adding a section to Binder requires more resources than adding
information to an existing section. For example, adding twenty worksheets
to one Microsoft Excel section in your Binder requires less memory that
adding twenty Microsoft Excel sections to your Binder.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem and avoid receiving an "Out of Memory" error
message when you are working in a Binder, limit the number of sections in a
Binder to 25-30. You can combine Microsoft Excel sections into fewer
sections with multiple sheets to reduce the total number of sections and
therefore reduce the overhead associated with keeping the information in
the Microsoft Binder.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
