IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry  Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

WARNING: The information in this article has not been confirmed or tested
by Microsoft. Some or all of the information in this article has been taken
from unconfirmed customer reports. ANY USE BY YOU OF THE INFORMATION

<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains information about troubleshooting and eliminating
invalid page faults that occur in module Kernel32.dll when you work with a
Microsoft Office program under Microsoft Windows 95. When a Kernel32.dll
error message appears, a message similar to the following appears
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;Program name&gt; caused an invalid page fault in module Kernel32.dll

</PRE>where &lt;Program name&gt; is the name of the program you are using.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When an invalid page fault occurs, an unexpected event occurs in the
Microsoft Windows operating system. An invalid page fault typically
indicates that a program improperly attempted to use random access memory,
for example, when a program or a Windows component reads or writes to a
memory location that is not allocated to it. When this occurs, the program
can potentially overwrite and corrupt other program code in that area of
memory.
<P>
An invalid page fault may occur when parameters are passed between programs
and the Windows operating system. An invalid parameter may cause a program
to execute invalid instructions, which results in an invalid page fault.
This behavior usually occurs because a program incorrectly passes data that
Windows or a Windows-based program cannot interpret.
<P>
It is important that you follow the steps in each of the sections in this
article in the order in which they are presented. Because invalid page
faults are typically caused when two or more programs interact, skipping
steps may prolong identifying the problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Determine Whether the Problem Is Documented</h3>
 
<P>
Many Kernel32.dll errors are already documented in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base and have solutions. For more information, query on the following words
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   "invalid page fault" kernel32.dll

</PRE>NOTE: It may be helpful to add the program name in which the problem occurs
at the end of the query to narrow your search.
<P>

   TITLE     : OFF97: Right-Clicking File Causes Error and Computer Stops

</PRE><h3>Start Windows in Safe Mode</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 has a built-in troubleshooting mode called Safe mode. It
bypasses startup files and uses only basic system drivers, including basic
networking. When you start Windows in Safe mode, Windows uses only the
mouse, keyboard, and standard video graphics adapter (VGA) device drivers.
This makes Safe mode useful for isolating and resolving error conditions
that are caused by both real-mode and Windows-based drivers. Windows 95
also has troubleshooting features that may help you identify the problem.
To start Windows 95 in Safe mode and make the additional troubleshooting
features available, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>In the Control Panel, double-click the System icon, and then click the
   Performance tab.

<P><LI>Click File System, and then click the Troubleshooting tab.

<P><LI>Click the following check boxes to select them:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Disable protect-mode hard disk interrupt handling
      Disable synchronous buffer commits
      Disable all 32-bit protect-mode disk drivers
      Disable write-behind caching for all drive
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click OK, click Close, and then click Yes.

<P><LI>Press F8 when you see the "Starting Windows 95" message.

<P><LI>On the Windows Startup menu, select option 3 (Safe Mode).

<P><LI>After Windows is running again, perform the same operation that caused
   the error.
<P>
</OL>When you use Safe mode or when you disable 32-bit protected-mode disk
drivers, Windows does not process protected-mode drivers, the Autoexec.bat
file, and the Config.sys file. Therefore, the CD-ROM drive is not
available. To use Safe mode with CD-ROM drive support, use the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Determine whether Windows 95 uses protected-mode drivers for the
   CD-ROM drive.
<P>
   For additional information, please see the following article in the
   Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<PRE></PRE>      TITLE     : Protected-Mode CD-ROM Drive Support in Windows 95

   If you are already using real-mode CD-ROM drive drivers, skip to step 3.

</PRE><P><LI>Install the real-mode (MS-DOS) drivers for the CD-ROM drive on the
   computer. The real-mode drivers are usually located on a disk that
   is shipped with the CD-ROM drive or with the computer. The drivers
   are installed in the Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files.

<P><LI>On the Start menu, click run. In the Open box, type "sysedit" (without
   the quotation marks) and click OK.

<P><LI>In the System Configuration Editor, click the Config.sys Window to view
   the contents of the Config.sys file. Locate the line that loads the
   CD-ROM drive device driver.
<P>
   NOTE: This line contains the following two lines:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DEVICE=
      /d:&lt;CD-ROM drive device identifier&gt;
</PRE><P>
   Write down the drive device identifier string after "/d:". For example,
   the drive device identifier is similar to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      MSCD001
</PRE>
<P><LI>Restart the computer. When the "Starting Windows 95" message appears,
   press F8.

<P><LI>On the Windows Startup menu, select option 5 (Step-by-Step
   Confirmation). For the following displayed questions, use the answers
   that are listed in the following table.
<P>

      Load DoubleSpace driver?                            NO*
      Process the System Registry?                        NO
      Create a Startup Log File (BOOTLOG.TXT)?            NO
      Process your startup device drivers (CONFIG.SYS)?   YES

      *Unless you are using compression

   Note that you must load Himem.sys, Ifshlp.sys, and the CD-ROM drive
   drivers that you installed in step 1. If possible, avoid loading other
   drivers. Note that some CD-ROM drives require more than one driver.

</PRE><P><LI>For the following displayed questions, use the answers that are listed
   in the following table.
<P>
<PRE>      Question                                            Answer
      ----------------------------------------------------------

      Load the Windows graphical user interface?          NO
      WIN?                                                NO

</PRE><P><LI>At the MS-DOS prompt, type the command using the following syntax,

      device identifier&gt; /l:&lt;CD-ROM drive letter&gt; /s
</PRE><P>
   Note that &lt;Windows drive letter&gt; is the drive letter for the volume that
   contains Microsoft Windows, &lt;Windows folder&gt; is the path to the folder
   that contains Microsoft Windows, and &lt;drive device identifier&gt; is the
   identifier you wrote down in step 4.
<P>
   For example, type a command that is similar to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\windows\command\mscdex /d:mscd001 /l:d /s
</PRE>
<P><LI>At the MS-DOS prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      win /d:m
</PRE><P>
   If you require network support, type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      win /d:n
</PRE><P>
</OL><h3>Disable the CD-ROM Drive Cache</h3>
 
<P>
If the error message appears while you are reading from a CD-ROM drive, try
disabling the CD-ROM drive cache. This may make the drive more reliable but
reduce performance. To disable the CD-ROM drive cache, use the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click System.

<P><LI>Click the Performance tab and click File System.

<P><LI>Click the CD-ROM tab, click No Read-Ahead in the "Optimize access
   pattern for" list.

<P><LI>Verify that the Supplemental Cache Size slider is positioned in the far
   left position (the Small setting), and then click OK.
<P>
</OL>If you are using real-mode CD-ROM drive drivers, the drive may be cached by
the Smartdrv.exe program. If this is the case, remark the line from the
Autoexec.bat by typing "REM" (without the quotation marks) at the beginning
of the line.
<P>
<P><h3>Check for Registry Corruption</h3>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
When you start Windows 95 in Safe mode, Windows does not read the entire
registry. Therefore, damage to the registry may not be evident when you run
Windows in this mode. It may be necessary to replace the existing registry
(System.dat) with a backup to determine whether the problem is caused by a
damaged registry. To troubleshoot a damaged registry, use the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Restart the computer. When the "Starting Windows 95" message appears,
   press F8.

<P><LI>On the Windows Startup menu, select option 6 (Command Prompt Only).

<P><LI>To remove the file attributes from the backup of the registry, type the
   following command, and then press ENTER.:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\windows\command\attrib -h -s -r c:\system.1st
</PRE>
<P><LI>To remove the file attributes from the current registry, type the
   following command, and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\windows\command\attrib -h -s -r c:\windows\system.dat
</PRE>
<P><LI>To rename the registry, type the following command, and then press
   ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ren c:\windows\system.dat *.dax
</PRE>
<P><LI>To copy the backup file to the current registry, type the following
   command, and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy c:\system.1st c:\windows\system.dat
</PRE>
<P><LI>Restart the computer. If the Windows 95 Startup Menu displays, choose
   Safe Mode, or Safe Mode with Network Support if you need network
   connectivity.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The System.1st file is a backup of the registry that is created
during the final stage of a Microsoft Windows 95 installation. Therefore,
the "Running Windows 95 for the first time" banner appears, and Windows 95
finalizes settings as if you reinstalled it.
<P>
If replacing the System.dat file with the System.1st file resolves the
issue, the problem may be related to registry damage. Note that you may
have to reinstall programs and device drivers that you installed after you
installed Windows 95 to update the new registry.
<P>
If the issue is not resolved, restore the original registry. To do this,
use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Restart the computer. When the "Starting Windows 95" message appears,
   press F8.

<P><LI>On the Windows Startup menu, select option 6 (Command Prompt Only).

<P><LI>Type the following commands:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\windows\command\attrib -s -h -r c:\windows\system.dat
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      copy c:\windows\system.dax c:\windows\system.dat
</PRE>
<P><LI>Restart the computer.

   TITLE     : How to Troubleshoot Registry Errors

</PRE></OL><h3>Check for a Valid Temporary Folder and Excess Temporary Files</h3>
 
<P>
There should be at least 3 megabytes (MB) of free space on the hard disk
that contains the temporary folder. To check for a temporary folder and
delete excess files from that folder, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Close any running programs and restart your computer by clicking
   Shutdown on the Start menu and clicking Restart Your Computer (Microsoft
   Windows 95) or Restart (Under Windows NT). Press F8 when you see the
   "Starting Windows 95" message, and then choose "Safe mode command prompt
   only."

<P><LI>Type "set" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER. Note the
   location of the TEMP variable.

<P><LI>Change to the folder you noted in step 2. For example, if TEMP is set
   to C:\WINDOWS\TEMP, type the following line and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      cd\windows\temp
</PRE><P>
   If the folder you noted in step 2 does not exist, create the folder. For
   example, you can create a temporary folder called win95tmp on drive C by
   typing the following line at the command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      md c:\win95tmp
</PRE>
<P><LI>Delete any temporary files in this folder. Temporary files typically
   have a .tmp file name extension. To delete these files, type the
   following line, and then press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      del *.tmp
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: Do not delete these files from within the Windows 95 graphical
   user interface (that is, when you are running Windows 95) because
   Windows 95 or a Windows program may be using one of these files.
<P>
</OL><h3>Check the Hard Disk for Disk Errors and Fragmentation</h3>
 
<P>
Use the ScanDisk program to check the hard disk for lost clusters and other
file allocation table (FAT) errors and to test the hard disk integrity. You
can also use the ScanDisk program to repair any of these problems. To run
ScanDisk, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, point to Programs.

<P><LI>Point to Accessories, point to System Tools, and then click ScanDisk.
<P>
</OL>Hard disks that are very fragmented can affect the performance and
reliability Microsoft Office programs and other tasks in Windows 95. To
resolve this problem, run Disk Defragmenter to defragment the hard disk. To
run Disk Defragmenter, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, point to Programs.

<P><LI>Point to Accessories, point to System Tools, and then click Disk
   Defragmenter.
<P>
</OL><h3>Verify That the Compact Disc is Clean and Unscratched</h3>
 
<P>
If the error message appears while you are installing from a compact disc,
verify that the compact disc you are using is clean. You can wipe the
compact disc with a soft, lint-free cloth. Also ensure that there are no
large scratches on the compact disc. If the compact disc is damaged and
unreadable, error messages may appear during installation.
<P>
<P><h3>Check for a Corrupt Swap File</h3>
 
<P>
The Kernel32.dll error may also appear if your Windows swap file is
corrupted. To create a new swap file, restart the computer in MS-DOS mode,
delete the Win386.swp file in the Windows folder, and then restart the
computer. To create a new swap file, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, click Shut Down.

<P><LI>In the Shut Down Windows dialog box, click "Restart the Computer in
   MS-DOS Mode," and then click Yes.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS prompt, switch to the Windows folder by typing the
   following command
<P>
<P><PRE>      cd &lt;drive&gt;:\Windows
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter that contains the Windows folder.
<P>
   Typically, &lt;drive&gt; is C.
<P>
   NOTE: The swap file exists in the Windows folder if Windows manages
   virtual memory settings on your computer. If you chose to manage
   virtual memory settings on the computer, the swap file exists at the
   root level of the hard disk. To determine whether Windows manages
   virtual memory settings, right-click My Computer, click Properties,
   click Performance, and then click Virtual Memory.

<P><LI>To delete the swap file, type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      del Win386.swp
</PRE>
<P><LI>After you delete the swap file, restart the computer.
<P>
</OL><h3>Disable Enhanced BIOS Features</h3>
 
<P>
Most computers have several enhanced settings that allow the computer to
fully utilize the computer hardware. These high-speed settings can cause
the system to become unstable; disabling these features may make the
computer more stable. Contact your computer manufacturer for information
about entering the basic input/output system (BIOS) and changing the BIOS
settings. You can enter the BIOS on most systems immediately after turning
on the power. Usually a keystroke (such as DEL) is required to enter the
BIOS. Below are the common features that can interfere with Microsoft
Office programs:
<P>
<PRE>   Memory Shadow RAM
   Video Shadow RAM
   Internal Cache
   External Cache
   Built-in Virus Protection

</PRE></OL>Newer chipsets may have more advanced features (such as memory wait states)
that may cause errors. Most BIOS installation programs have an option to
load the BIOS default settings. This option usually disables all advanced
features.
<P>
WARNING: Incorrectly altering hardware BIOS settings can cause serious
problems that may cause your computer to fail to start or function
properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems that result from the
incorrect setting of hardware BIOS options can be solved. Alter the
hardware BIOS settings at your own risk.
<P>
<P><h3>Remove and Reinstall the Program</h3>
 
<P>
If the problem occurs after you run the Setup program, some of the dynamic
link library (DLL) files may be damaged or corrupt. To troubleshoot this
problem, first completely remove the program. For additional information,
please see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE><h3>Scan the Computer for Viruses</h3>
 
<P>
If a virus is present on your computer and has damaged some files,
Kernel32.dll error messages may appear when you use a program. Scan the
hard disk and floppy disks with a virus detector. If the virus detector
finds a virus on your computer, remove the virus before you run the Office
program again. If a virus is found on your Setup disk, you must obtain a
new set of disks.
<P>
NOTE: Do not run a virus detector terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program
while you run any of the Microsoft Office programs, including the Setup
program. Run a virus detector before you run the Setup program, and then
disable it.
<P>
Microsoft has rigorous quality control measures to insure that viruses are
not on disks that we ship. The Setup disks for the programs listed at the
beginning of this article are distributed without viruses in sealed clear
plastic envelopes. Each envelope displays a message about the Microsoft
software license agreement. If you purchase Microsoft disks in any other
type of package, do not use them.
