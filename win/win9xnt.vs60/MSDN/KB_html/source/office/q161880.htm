<P>
<P><h3>Case 1</h3>
 
<P>
When you select My Computer in the Look In box in the Open dialog box, you
receive the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation
   and will be shut down.

   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>When you click the Details button, you receive the following error message:

   KERNEL32.DLL at 0137:bff9a28c.

</PRE><h3>Case 2</h3>
 
<P>
When you select My Computer in the Look In box in either the Save or Save
As dialog box, you receive the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.

   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>When you click the Details button, you receive the following error message:
<P>

</PRE><h3>Case 3</h3>
 
<P>
When you click the Up One Level button in the Open, Save, or Save As dialog
box to move to My Computer in the Look In box, you receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   You do not have access to the folder '#####N'. See your administrator
   for access to this folder.

   NOTE: Each number sign (#) in the above error message represents a
   square. The square character does not display in ASCII text.

   Folder and then click either of the following:

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
