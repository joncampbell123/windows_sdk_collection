<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office Setup program in maintenance mode, and
you choose to remove one of the Microsoft Office applications for the first
time, you are prompted to insert one of the Setup disks to continue with
the Setup program.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Normally, you are not prompted to insert a floppy disk in order to remove
any of the components from your hard drive when you run the Microsoft
Office Setup program in maintenance mode.
<P>
This behavior occurs when you install Microsoft Office from floppy disks,
and you chose the Custom/Complete installation option. The problem occurs
whether you use the Distribution Media Format (DMF) floppy disks, the 1.2
megabyte (MB) floppy disks or the 1.44 MB floppy disks. The problem occurs
only when you choose to remove one of the Microsoft Office applications,
such as Microsoft Word or Microsoft PowerPoint, and only occurs the first
time you remove one of the applications.
<P>
This behavior occurs because of a problem with the Microsoft Office Setup
Table File, SETUP.STF. When you run Setup, some of the components that you
choose to install are not recorded as being "installed," even though they
are copied to your hard drive and registered correctly during the
installation.
<P>
When you run Setup in maintenance mode and you choose to remove a Microsoft
Office application for the first time, and you are prompted to insert one
of the Setup disks, Setup compares the files on the Setup disk to those
installed on your hard drive, and records that these files are installed.
After this problem occurs, the information is recorded correctly, and you
should not be prompted for the Setup disks again when you run Setup in
maintenance mode.
<P>
Note that when using DMF disks, if Setup is started from the icon in
Program Manager, after asking for disk 10, Setup reports an error with disk
10. To avoid this message, start the setup program from Disk 1 Setup
instead of Program Manager.
<P>

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
