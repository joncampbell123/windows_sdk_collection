</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program in maintenance mode,
you may receive error messages similar to the following:
<P>
<P><h3>If You Click Reinstall</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   SelfReg
   Failed to unregister .SRG file.

   -and-

   Setup could not create the folder 'D:\OFFICE\'.

   -and-

   There is not enough disk space to complete installation. You can
   change your installation options, continue installation, or exit
   Setup.

   -and-

   Setup tried to create an invalid path using 'D:\office\' and
   'OFFICE\PSS8.HLP'.

   NOTE: You receive over 100 error messages similar to the previous error
   message.

   -and-

   Setup Parse Error in Initialize pass
   Object ID 1081: RegFile Object: Failed to Register .SRG File
   D:\Office\EXCEL8.SRG.

   -and-

   Setup could not open the file: 'D:\Office\EXCEL.EXE'.

   -and-

   Setup is not yet complete.
   If you quit now, the product will not be installed properly.
   Quit Setup?

</PRE><h3>If You Click Remove All</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>   SelfReg
   Failed to unregister .SRG file.

   -and-

   Setup Error in Initialize pass
   Object ID 8623: RegMso Object: Failed to load Mso97.dll.

   -and-

   Microsoft Office 97 Setup was not completed successfully.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You perform a Run From CD installation of Microsoft Office 97 on
   your computer.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You change the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive by installing a new
   hard disk or other type of drive, by creating a new hard disk partition
   (or partitions), or by manually changing the CD-ROM drive letter.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You run the Setup program and click Reinstall or Remove All.
<P>
</UL>For example, if the CD-ROM drive is drive D when you perform a Run From CD
installation of Microsoft Office 97, and you then change the CD-ROM drive
to drive J, the problem occurs when you run Setup and click Reinstall or
Remove All.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, do not change the drive letter of
the CD-ROM drive after you install Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
If the problem described in this article already occurred, use the
following appropriate method.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
If the problem occurs after you run Setup and click Reinstall, run
Microsoft Office 97 Setup again. The Setup program allows you to perform a
new installation of Microsoft Office 97. All settings that refer to the
earlier CD-ROM drive designation are overwritten by the new settings.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
If the problem occurs after you run Setup and click Remove All, (or if you
have not run Microsoft Office 97 Setup since you changed the CD-ROM drive)
use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, point to Find, and click Files Or Folders.

<P><LI>In the Named box, type "Off97pro.stf" or "Off97std.stf" (without
   the quotation marks). Verify that the Look In box refers to drive C,
   and that the Include Subfolders check box is selected. Then, click Find
   Now.

<P><LI>In the list of found files, right-click the .stf file. On the shortcut
   menu, click Rename.

<P><LI>Change the file name to "Off97pro.yyy" or "Off97std.yyy" (without
   the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

<P><LI>Close the Find dialog box.

<P><LI>Run Microsoft Office 97 Setup and perform a new installation of
   Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
One way to prevent the CD-ROM drive from being changed is to manually set
the drive letter to a letter that is ordered later in the alphabet, for
example, R or S. This reduces the likelihood that the CD-ROM drive is
automatically changed when you install a new hard disk or create a new disk
partition.
<P>
For information about changing the drive letter of a CD-ROM drive, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win95x/q121244.htm">Q121244</A></B>
   TITLE     : How to Change the Drive Letter of a CD-ROM Drive

</PRE></OL>When you perform a Run From CD installation of Microsoft Office 97, most
of the files that are used by Microsoft Office 97 programs are stored on
the Microsoft Office 97 compact disc. Because of this, there are a large
number of registry keys that refer to the locations of files on the compact
disc.
<P>
If you change the drive letter for your CD-ROM drive, these settings no
longer refer to the correct locations for the required files. As a result,
you cannot run any of the Microsoft Office 97 programs unless you first
reinstall Microsoft Office 97. If you run Microsoft Office 97 Setup and
click Reinstall or Remove All, you may receive the error messages described
in this article.
<P>
If you changed your CD-ROM drive letter and you already attempted to
reinstall Microsoft Office 97, run Microsoft Office 97 Setup again and
perform a new installation.
