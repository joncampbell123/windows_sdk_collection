<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the Microsoft applications listed above, when you change or add an
extension to a filename in the Save As dialog box, an additional extension
may be added to the filename. For example, if you use the Save As dialog
box in Microsoft PowerPoint to save your presentation as SLIDES.ABC, the
file may be saved as SLIDES.ABC.PPT.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you save a file in the Save As dialog box, the extension defaults to
match the file type listed in the Save As Type box. If you change the
extension or add an extension, the default extension is appended to the new
extension.
<P>
When you save a document in Microsoft Word, the default extension that
appears in the Save As Type list is Word Document (*.doc). If you save a
file with an extension other than *.doc while this default extension is
selected in the Save As Type list, the extension .DOC is appended to the
filename that you entered. For example, if you save a file as TEST.DAT
while Word Document (*.doc) is selected in the Save As Type list, the file
is saved as TEST.DAT.DOC.
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Windows 95. The extension that
appears in the Save As Type list is appended to the filename when you save
a file, even if you enter an extension for the file. Note however that the
extension is not appended if you enter the same extension that appears in
the Save As Type list. For example, if you save your Microsoft Excel
worksheet as TEST.XLS while Microsoft Excel Workbook (*.xls) is selected in
the Save As Type list, the file is saved as TEST.XLS, not as TEST.XLS.XLS.
<P>
This behavior occurs because of the functionality of using long file names,
and the ability to save a file with a filename that contains a period (.).
The file extension in Microsoft Windows 95 identifies the file type.
Because of this, if you save a file with a file extension that is not
registered in Windows, such as .DAT, the file type is displayed as DAT
File.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To save a file with an extension other than one of the extensions available
in the Save As Type list, enclose the entire filename in quotation marks as
in the following examples:
<P>
<PRE>   "test.dat"

   -or-

   "slides.dat"

</PRE>Note that you can also turn off the display of file extensions for
registered file types in Windows by doing the following in Windows Explorer
or My Computer:
<P>
<PRE>   1. On the View menu, click Options.

   2. Click the View tab.

   3. Select the "Hide MS-DOS File Extensions For File Types That Are
      Registered" check Box, and then click OK.
