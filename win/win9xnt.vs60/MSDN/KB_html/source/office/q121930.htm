The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.3-CD, 4.3c-CD
<LI>Microsoft Access, version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform a Run from CD installation of Microsoft Office, and you
use one of the sample applications provided with Microsoft Access, any of
the following symptoms may occur:

<UL><LI>When you choose the Start The Solutions Sample Application topic in the
   startup cue card (appears the first time you run Microsoft Access), you
   cannot locate the SAMPAPPS directory on your hard drive as directed.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>When you open the sample database, you receive the following error
   message
<P>
<P><PRE>      Database '&lt;database name&gt;' is read-only. You won't be able to save
      changes made to data or object definitions in this database
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;database name&gt; is the name of the database that you open, such as
   NWIND.MDB, ORDERS.MDB, or SOLUTION.MDB.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>When you choose the Add Products button on the Suppliers form in the
   NWIND database, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Can't set value
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems occur because when you perform a Run From CD installation of
Microsoft Office, the sample database files are not copied to the local
hard drive. Instead, the directory that contains these files, SAMPAPPS, and
the files that are contained in the directory are left on the CD, which is
not a media that you can write to. Because you cannot write to the sample
database files, you may receive various error messages.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around the problems listed above, copy the SAMPAPPS directory,
located on the Microsoft Office CD, to your local hard drive. You can then
change the attributes of the files to read-write so that you can make
changes to the database files. Normally this directory is located in the
Microsoft Access directory, as in the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\MSOFFICE\ACCESS\SAMPAPPS.

</PRE>Note that the SAMPAPPS directory is located on the Disk 1 CD of the
Microsoft Office version 4.3c-CD disk set.
<P>
After you copy these files to your local hard drive, you can use the
following steps in File Manager to change the attributes of the files:

<OL><P><LI>Select the files in the SAMPAPPS directory that are now located on your
   hard drive.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Properties.

<P><LI>In the Properties dialog box, under Attributes, clear the Read Only
   check box, and choose OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The SAMPAPPS directory contains the following sample applications and
help files:
<P>
<PRE>   NEWCUST.DBF
   ORDERS.HLP
   SOLUTION.HLP
   NWIND.MDB
   ORDERS.MDB
   SOLUTION.MDB
</PRE>
