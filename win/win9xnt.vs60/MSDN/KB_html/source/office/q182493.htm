idle for the period of time you have set in the After Dark control panel.
Also, the After Dark screen saver does not appear when you use the Sleep
Hot Key or when you use the sleep corners that you have set in the After
Dark control panel.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>

<UL><LI>You are running After Dark version 4.0.3
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You are running the Microsoft Office Manager.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You are running Mac OS 8.0 or 8.1.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, turn off the Microsoft Office Manager (MOM)
menu. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Point to Control Panels on the Apple menu, and then click Microsoft
   Office Manager.

longer appears. However, you can still use the QuickSwitch key combination
(usually COMMAND+TAB) to switch between running programs.

<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
