<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you print from a Microsoft Office for Windows program, you receive
one of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Word
   ----

   Word cannot change printers. No printers are installed.

   -or-

   Word cannot print due to a problem with the current printer setup.

   Microsoft Excel
   ---------------

   There is no printer installed. Use the Printers option in Control
   Panel to install a printer.

   PowerPoint
   ----------

   There is no printer installed.

   -or-

   The printer could not be found.

   Schedule
   --------

   Unable to complete the print operation. There is no default printer.
   Use the Control Panel to select a default printer.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The error messages listed above may occur if one of the following
conditions exist:
<P>
<PRE>   You do not have a Win.ini file.

    -or-

   The Devices section of the Win.ini file is missing.

    -or-

   The Devices section of the Win.ini file contains incomplete or incorrect
   information.

</PRE>Note that if you remove the Win.ini, or if it becomes corrupted, and you
then restart Windows 95, a new Win.ini is created. However, the new
Win.ini contains only the Desktop and/or Embedding sections. The Devices
section is missing.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Reinstall the Printer Driver</h3>
 
<P>
This will create the required information for the Devices section as well
as write the correct entries for the Ports, Printer Ports, and Windows
sections in the Win.ini.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Correct an Entry in Win.ini</h3>
 
<P>
Locate the Win.ini file and correct the Devices section:

<OL><P><LI>On the Windows 95 taskbar, click Start and point to Find.

<P><LI>Click "Files or Folders."

<P><LI>In the Find All Files dialog box, click the Name &amp; Location tab.

<P><LI>In the Named box, type "Win.ini" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>In the Look In box, choose the name of your hard disk.

<P><LI>Select the Include Subfolders check box and click Find Now.

<P><LI>Right-click the Win.ini file, and click Open.

<P><LI>In the Win.ini file, find the [Devices] section.

<P><LI>The Devices section should list the friendly name of the printer
   followed by an equal sign, the driver name, comma, and then the port
   or network path. If the [Devices] section is missing, add it. The
   following is a sample [Devices] section:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [Devices]
      HP LaserJet 4/4M=HPPCL5MS,LPT1:
      HP LaserJet IIISi=HPPCL5MS,\\Server\Sharename
</PRE><P>
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 3: Create a new Win.ini</h3>
 
<P>
If neither Method 1 nor Method 2 resolves your problem, you can create a
new Win.ini file with the correct information.
<P>
Rename the Win.ini to Win.old, and reinstall Windows 95. Windows 95
detects that you are reinstalling, and a dialog box will appear with the
title "Run Setup Again?" The dialog box will give you two options. Select
the first option (to restore Windows files that are changed or corrupted)
and reinstall Windows 95.
<P>
This method recreates a new, complete Win.ini with all of the required
sections.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
