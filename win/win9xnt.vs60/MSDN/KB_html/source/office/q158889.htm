The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the programs listed at the beginning of this article, when you print a
document that contains an imported graphic file, the imported graphic may
not be printed correctly. However, the graphic may appear correctly on the
screen and in print preview.
<P>
NOTE: This problem is likely to occur when the graphic includes a region
of
text that you fill with a special effect, such as a rainbow or gradient
fill.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You saved the graphic file in the Windows Enhanced Metafile (EMF)
   format.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You created the graphic file in Corel Draw and used the Export To EMF
   option.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You print to a PostScript printer.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, you do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Print to a non-PostScript printer.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Export the graphic file in a format other than the EMF format. For
   example, export the graphic file in the GIF, JPG, or BMP format.
<P>
   A graphic file that you save in these formats should be printed
   correctly to a PostScript printer.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Office 97 programs can import graphics files in a variety of
formats and print documents that contain these imported graphics.
<P>
If you export a graphics file from Corel Draw in the EMF format, and then
print to a PostScript printer, the EMF file may not be printed correctly
from any program (including the programs listed at the beginning of this
article). Note that this problem may also occur when you print an EMF file
that you export from another graphics programs.
