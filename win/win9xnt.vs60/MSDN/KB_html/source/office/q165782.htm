<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install any of the components that are included in the Microsoft
Office 97 ValuPack, you cannot run any of the Setup programs for these
components in quiet mode. You cannot use quiet mode even if you include any
of the following switches on the command line for the Setup program:
<P>
<PRE>   /q
   /q0
   /q1
   /qt

</PRE>As a result, you cannot automate running the Setup programs. You must run
each Setup program manually.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because the Setup programs for ValuPack components are
not designed to run in quiet mode.
<P>
If you want to install ValuPack components on a particular computer, you
must run the Setup program for each component at that computer and proceed
manually through all of the dialog boxes that are displayed by the Setup
program.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of the Setup programs for the components
included in the Microsoft Office 97 ValuPack.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you install a Microsoft program, you may be able to install the
program in quiet mode. When you install a program in quiet mode, the Setup
program does not display many (or any) of the dialog boxes that are
normally displayed. Usually, you can run a Microsoft Setup program in quiet
mode by adding a "/q" switch to the command line that you use to run the
Setup program.
<P>
Microsoft Office 97 ValuPack components that are installed by running an
executable program (an .exe file) do not support installation in quiet
mode. This is because the installation technology that is used by these
programs is different from the installation technology that is used by
Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
The following Microsoft Office 97 ValuPack components do not support quiet
mode installation:
<P>

   Lotus cc:Mail information service
