The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you play a Microsoft Camcorder movie (an .avi file), the movie may not
be played correctly. Instead, the entire screen appears to be black except
for the pointer, the Stop window that is displayed by Microsoft Camcorder,
and a thin strip at the bottom of the screen.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if you are using a NeoMagic video driver. Microsoft
Camcorder movies may not be played back correctly on a computer that is
using a NeoMagic video driver.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, switch to a different video driver (for
example, the standard VGA video driver).
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you use Microsoft Camcorder and certain NeoMagic
video drivers. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
