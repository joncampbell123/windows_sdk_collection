The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office 97 from an administrative installation
("setup /a") stored on a network server, some of the components included
with Microsoft Office 97 may not be copied to your computer's hard disk.
<P>
For example, the following components may not be installed:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Office Shortcut Bar
   Equation Editor
   Microsoft Photo Editor

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem will occur if you used the /q (quiet mode) switch in the
command line when you ran Microsoft Office 97 Setup, but you did not use
any of the /b switches (/b1, /b2, /b3).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, include the appropriate /b switch
in the command line that you use to run Microsoft Office 97 Setup:
<P>
<PRE>   Switch   Type of Installation
   -----------------------------

   /b1      Typical
   /b2      Custom
   /b3      Run from CD/Server

</PRE>For example, to perform a Custom installation of Microsoft Excel 97 from
drive X, using the custom settings stored in Custom.lst and Custom.stf,
you would use the following command line:
<P>
<PRE>   x:\setup.exe /l custom.lst /q /b2

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program, the Setup program
always performs a Typical installation unless you specifically instruct it
to do otherwise. To perform another type of installation, click a button in
the appropriate dialog box or add a switch to the command line that you use
to run Setup.
<P>
There are three types of installation you can perform:
<P>
<PRE>   Type of Installation   What is Installed?
   --------------------------------------------------------------------

   Typical                The most commonly-used components are
                          installed. However, some components are not
                          installed. This is the default type of
                          installation.

   Custom                 A dialog box appears and allows you to select
                          specific components to install. Use Custom if
                          you want to install all available components.

   Run from CD/Server     Only files that are required to be on your
                          computer's hard disk are copied. All other
                          files are stored on the CD-ROM or server.

</PRE>There are two ways to control what type of installation the Setup program
will perform:

<UL><LI>In the Microsoft Office Setup dialog box, click Typical, Custom, or
   "Run from CD/Run from Network Server".
<P>
   NOTE: This option is not available if the command line that you use
   to run Microsoft Office 97 Setup includes the /q (quiet mode) switch,
   any of the /b switches, or a combination of both. If you use any of
   these switches, the dialog box that contains the three buttons does not
   appear.

<LI>Include the appropriate /b switch in the command line that you use to
   run Microsoft Office 97 Setup.
<P>
</UL>When you use the /b, /q, and /l switches together in the command line that
you use to run Microsoft Office 97 Setup, the /l switch must be first. For
example:
<P>
<PRE>   Command Line                        Type of Installation Performed
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

   x:\setup.exe /q                     Setup is run in quiet mode. Because
                                       no installation type is specified,
                                       a Typical installation is performed.

   x:\setup.exe /l custom.lst          Setup is run and uses the custom
                                       settings in the Custom.lst and
                                       Custom.stf files. To choose
                                       what type of installation to
                                       perform, click the appropriate
                                       button in the Microsoft Office
                                       Setup dialog box.

   x:\setup.exe /l custom.lst /q       Setup is run in quiet mode. Although
                                       the settings in Custom.lst and
                                       Custom.stf will be loaded, a
                                       Typical installation is performed
                                       because no type was specified.

   x:\setup.exe /q /b2                 Setup runs in quiet mode and
                                       performs a Custom installation
                                       using the default custom settings.

   x:\setup.exe /l custom.lst /q /b2   Setup runs in quiet mode and
                                       performs a Custom installation
                                       using the settings stored in the
                                       Custom.lst and Custom.stf files.
