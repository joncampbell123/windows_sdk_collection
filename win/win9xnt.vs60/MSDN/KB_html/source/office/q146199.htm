<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Lotus cc:Mail, you may receive a general protect fault error message
when you start cc:Mail after you set up Microsoft Office for Windows 95. If
you click Details, the message states that an execution error occurred in
Ccmail.exe, and cc:Mail is closed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem has been reported to occur when a customer installs Office
7.0, clicks Yes when prompted to connect to cc:Mail from the Send command
in Office programs, and then starts cc:Mail from the shortcut icon.
<P>
The error may appear because the Setup program installs an updated Dynamic
Link Library (.dll) file that cc:Mail attempts to use but cannot.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, start cc:Mail from the MS-DOS prompt. To do
this, create a batch (.bat) file that starts cc:Mail in an MS-DOS window,
and then create a shortcut that points to the batch file.

<P>
To start cc:Mail in an MS-DOS window, a customer can use the following
batch file:
<P>
@echo off
REM This file calls cc:Mail Mobile to run the Windows version
REM of cc:Mail from an MS-DOS window.
cd c:\ccmobile
ccmail.exe
cd\windows
exit
<P>
NOTE: In the fourth and sixth lines of the .bat file, the folder locations
for "ccmobile" and "windows", may differ depending on where the customer
installs cc:Mail and Microsoft Windows 95.
<P>
To create a shortcut, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Using the right mouse button, click on the Desktop.

<P><LI>Click New, and then click Shortcut.

<P><LI>To select the batch file, click Browse, locate the file, and double-
   click it.
<P></OL>
