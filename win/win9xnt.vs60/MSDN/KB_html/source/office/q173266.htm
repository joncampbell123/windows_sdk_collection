The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office Setup program you may see a dialog box at
the beginning of setup that contains the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Creating the list of previous Office files.

</PRE>You may also see a dialog box at the end of the Office Setup program with
the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Creating a list of duplicate files that can be removed.

</PRE>These two messages are misleading; there are not any files created that
allow you to view these lists.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you want the Office Upgrade Wizard to create viewable files that contain
the aforementioned lists, you can make an entry in the Windows registry
before running the Office Setup program.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
before you edit the registry.
<P>
To have the Office Setup program create the list of files flagged and
removed by the Upgrade Wizard, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu click Run. Type Regedit in the Open box and
    then click OK.

<P><LI>Double-click the key for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.

<P><LI>Double-click the key for SOFTWARE.

<P><LI>Double-click the key for Microsoft.

<P><LI>With the Microsoft key selected, on the Edit menu, point to New and
    click Key.

<P><LI>Rename the key to "Office Upgrade Wizard" (without quotation marks.)

<P><LI>With the Office Upgrade Wizard key selected, on the Edit menu point to
    New and click Key.

<P><LI>Rename the key to "Generate Log Files", (without quotation marks.)
<P>
    NOTE: Do not set any value for this key, just the existance of the key
    causes the setup program to generate the log files.

<P><LI>On the Registry menu, click Exit.

<P><LI>Run the Office Setup program.
<P>
</OL>The log files, Pcpass1.txt and Pcpass2.txt, will be created in your
\Windows folder.
<P>
article does not clearly point \** out if the duplicates are going to be
deleted by the setup wizard or if the user has to delete them \** himself.
The txt files may not be
delete the files, whether the txt \** files are created or not.
