The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.2, 4.3
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office Manager (MOM), you receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>    This application uses CTL3DV2.DLL, which has not been correctly
    installed

</PRE>Note that this error message appears when you start Microsoft
Windows, if MOM is located in your STARTUP group.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message appears when the file CTL3DV2.DLL is located in
the Microsoft Office directory. This error message appears whether or
not this file is also located in your Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.
<P>
Normally, this file is copied to your Windows SYSTEM subdirectory
when you install Microsoft Office to your local hard drive. However,
if for some reason this file is copied to the Microsoft Office
directory, either during a workstation installation, or another
procedure, you receive the above error message when you start MOM.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving this error message when you run the Microsoft
Office Manager, do the following:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Use File Manager to search for the file CTL3DV2.DLL on all of the
      local drives on your computer. Include all subdirectories in your
      search.


   2. If you locate a copy of this file in a directory other than the
      Windows SYSTEM subdirectory, make sure that the copy of CTL3DV2.DLL
      with the most recent file date is located in your Windows SYSTEM
      subdirectory. If not, then move the copy of CTL3DV2.DLL with the most
      recent file date to the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.

   3. Delete or rename any additional copies of the file CTL3DV2.DLL to
      something like CTL3DV2.OLD.
