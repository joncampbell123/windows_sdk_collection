<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains troubleshooting steps you can use if you receive
errors running any Microsoft Office 97 program or Setup program under
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>VGA Mode</h3>
 
<P>
Start your computer using VGA mode, especially if the display is distorted
or unreadable text appears on the screen. By default, the Windows NT boot
loader menu offers options to start normally or in VGA mode. To force
Windows NT to use the standard VGA driver, choose the VGA Mode option.
<P>
<P><h3>Obtain the Latest Service Pack</h3>
 
<P>
Service Packs are means by which Windows NT product updates are
distributed. Service Packs keep the product current and extend and update
your computer's functionality so you will never have to worry about
becoming out of date. Service Packs include updates, system administration
tools, drivers, and additional components. All are conveniently bundled for
easy downloading. Service Packs are cumulative -- each new Service Pack
contains all the fixes in previous Service Packs, as well as any new fixes.
<P>
For additional information on obtaining the latest service pack, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : How To Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack

</PRE><h3>Check Permissions</h3>
 
<P>
You need to make sure you have the proper permissions set for your account.
To determine whether or not you have the proper permissions to run and use
the Office program you are having problems with, log on as an
administrator. When you log on to Windows NT 4.0 as an administrator, you
will have full read/write permission to all folders and files on the
computer. If logging on as an administrator resolves your problem, check
the permissions of your logon account.
<P>
For more information on permissions in Microsoft Office programs, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   Article-ID: <B><A href="../office/q169387.htm">Q169387</A></B>
   TITLE     : OFF97: Security Requirements When Using NTFS Partitions

</PRE><h3>Close Unnecessary Memory-Resident Programs</h3>
 
<P>
Programs that run in the background in memory are called terminate-and-
stay-resident programs (TSRs). For example, these programs may be virus
protection software, utility programs, print manager programs, or screen
savers. To determine if a terminate-and-stay-resident program is running,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Display the Close Program window (the task list) by pressing
   CTRL+ALT+DEL and then clicking Task List.

<P><LI>Close any unknown or unnecessary programs in the Close Program
   list by clicking the program and clicking End Task.

<P><LI>If you close a program and want to close another one, press CTRL+ALT+DEL
   and click Task List to display the Close Program window again. Repeat
   steps 1 through 3 until you close all unknown or unnecessary programs.
<P>
</OL>Some TSRs may load into memory but may not display on the Task List. These
TSRs are loaded via the Windows NT registry.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
To see what programs are loading via the registry, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, click Run. In the Open box, type "regedit" (without
   the quotation marks), and then click OK.

<P><LI>Select the following key in the registry:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
</PRE><P>
   This key lists all programs that are started when Windows NT 4.0 is
   loaded. The only program that is required in this key is System Tray
   (SysTray.exe). Other programs that are loading can cause problems
   with Office programs and should be disabled.

<P><LI>Select the following key in the registry:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
</PRE><P>
   Entries in this key are run once when the computer is restarted and then
   are deleted by the system. This key should be empty. Other programs that
   are loading can cause problems with Office programs and should be
   disabled.

<P><LI>Select the following key in the registry:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
</PRE><P>
   This key lists all programs that are started when Windows NT 4.0 is
   loaded. The only program that is required in this key is System Tray
   (SysTray.exe). Other programs that are loading can cause problems
   with Office programs and should be disabled.

<P><LI>Select the following key in the registry:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
</PRE><P>
   Entries in this key are run once when the computer is restarted and then
   are deleted by the system. This key should be empty. Other programs that
   are loading can cause problems with Office programs and should be
   disabled.
<P>
</OL><h3>Check the TEMP and TMP Environment Variables</h3>
 
<P>
An invalid TEMP or TMP environment variable can cause errors with Office
programs. Make sure your temporary folders are properly set up. To do so,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the System Icon. When the System
   Properties dialog box appears, click the Environment tab.
<P>
   This tab lists the current System and User variables. Look under the
   User variables for the TEMP and TMP environment variable settings.
   Ensure that the folders referenced by these variables exist and have
   valid folder names. Also ensure that the drive on which the folders are
   located has at least 3 megabytes (MB) of free hard drive space and that
   you have read/write permissions to those folders.
<P>
</OL><h3>Temporarily Disable the Network</h3>
 
<P>
If you do not require network access to run or install the Office programs,
try to temporarily disable the drivers that allow you to use the network.
This troubleshooting step prevents the system from loading the drivers that
are required to use the network when you restart the computer. Disabling
the network drivers and may reduce or eliminate system conflicts. To do
this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Settings on the Start menu, and then click Control Panel. In the
   Control Panel, double-click the System icon.

<P><LI>In the System Properties dialog box, click the Hardware Profiles tab.

<P><LI>Click Properties, and then click the Network tab. Click the
   Network-Disabled Hardware Profile check box. Then, click OK twice.

<P><LI>Next, restart the computer. To do this, click Shutdown on the Start
   menu. In the Shut Down Windows dialog box, click Restart The Computer
   and click Yes.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: To restore network access, repeat the previous steps but clear the
Network-Disabled Hardware Profile check box in step 3.
<P>
If disabling network access resolves your problem, you will need to try the
following:

<UL><LI>Contact your network interface card (NIC) manufacturer to obtain the
   most recent Windows NT 4.0 drivers for your NIC.

<LI>Ensure that you have the most recent Windows NT Service Pack. See the
   "Obtain the Latest Service Pack" section above.

<LI>Verify that your NIC is working properly. To do this, either replace
   your NIC or try your existing NIC on another machine.
