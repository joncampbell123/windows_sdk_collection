</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform a workstation installation of Microsoft Office, either
to a network drive location that has long filename support or to a local
drive on a computer where long filename support has not be turned off,
you may notice a set of folders in the \Templates folder. These folders
are for individual user-defined templates.
<P>
If you place your templates in the "Spreadsheet Solutions" (a long file
name) folder, when you click "New Office Document" on the Windows Start
menu, you will notice an extra folder option for "Spreadsheet Solutions."
If you put your user-defined template in the Memos folder (not a long
file name), the template appears adjacent to other files that are in the
Memos folder on the server.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In order for Microsoft Office for Windows 95 to support as many possible
network environments as possible, many of which currently do not support
long filenames, administrative installations are done without long
filenames. This causes the "Spreadsheet Solutions" folder on the server
to be truncated to "Excel" and the "Letters &amp; Faxes" folder to be
truncated to "Letters."
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you do not want to have the extra tabs created in the "New Office
Document" dialog box, rename the folders on your computer or in the
shared drive location to the same names as those on the server.
