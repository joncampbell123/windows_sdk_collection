The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.2, 4.3

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Microsoft Money from the Microsoft Office Manager (MOM)
toolbar, the application window is not maximized, even if the window
was maximized the last time you closed Money.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs whether you choose the Microsoft Money button,
or you choose Microsoft Money from the Microsoft Office menu.
<P>
Normally, when you start a Windows application using the MOM toolbar,
the application window appears the same size as it did when you last
closed the application. For example, if you close Microsoft Excel
while the application window is maximized, the next time you start
Microsoft Excel from the MOM toolbar, the application window is
maximized.
<P>
However, this behavior does not work when you close Microsoft Money while
the application window is maximized. When you start Money from the MOM
toolbar, the size of the application window is the size of the last
restored window, even if the application window was maximized when you
closed Money.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
