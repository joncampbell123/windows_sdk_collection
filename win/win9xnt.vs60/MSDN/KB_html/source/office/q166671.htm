<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you save a file from any Microsoft Office 97 program to a Microsoft
Windows 95 folder, you receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   The file &lt;filename&gt; already exists. Do you want to replace existing
   file?

</PRE>where &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the file you are saving.
<P>
If you click Yes, you receive either of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot save &lt;filename&gt;. The folder is marked as 'Read-Only'.

   -or-

   Document saved successfully. Cannot reopen the saved document due to
   low memory. Please close the document.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The first error message occurs if the following conditions are true:
<P>
<PRE>   The folder in which you attempt save the file is assigned user-level
   security permission.

     -and-

   The folder permissions are set to "Read Files" and "Create Files and
   Folders" only.

</PRE>The other error messages appear if the following conditions are true:
<P>
<PRE>   The folder in which you attempt to save the file is assigned user-level
   security permissions.

     -and-

   The folder permissions are set to "Read Files," "Create Files and
   Folders," and "Delete Files."

</PRE>This behavior occurs when the folder is assigned user-level security under
Microsoft Windows 95, and you (the user) are assigned Custom access rights
that do not include "Write to Files" permission. This behavior does not
occur when you use share-level security under Microsoft Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this behavior, change the folder permissions to include "Write
to Files" permission.
<P>
NOTE: If the folder is on a network server, contact your network
administrator.
<P>
To change the permissions for the Microsoft Windows 95 folder, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Microsoft Windows Explorer, right-click the folder and click Sharing
   on the shortcut menu.

<P><LI>In the Properties dialog box, click the Sharing tab.

<P><LI>Click Shared As and type in the Share Name box. If you want, type a
   comment in the Comments box.

<P><LI>If your user name is not in the Name box, click Add to add it. In
   the Add Users dialog box, type your user name in the Name box, click
   Custom, and then click OK.
<P>
   NOTE: To modify permissions for an existing user name, click the user's
   name, and then click Edit.

<P><LI>In the Change Access Rights dialog box, click to select the "Write to
   Files" check box. Click to select the "Create Files and Folders" and
   "Read Files" check boxes. Click OK.

<P><LI>Click OK to close the Properties dialog box.
<P>
</OL>Note: If you are not assigned "Delete Files" permission for a folder, a
temporary file may be left in the folder when you save a file. The result
is that twice as many files are stored in the folder than if you were
assigned the "Delete Files" permission. If "Delete Files" permission is not
assigned to you, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   "Document saved successfully. Cannot reopen the saved document due to
   low memory. Please close the document."

</PRE></OL>Note that the file is saved in the folder.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Windows 95. You must have "Write to
Files" permission for a folder to avoid receiving these error messages when
you save a file to a folder that uses Custom permissions.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior does not occur under Microsoft Windows 95 when the folder is
assigned share-level security. The behavior occurs only when the folder
uses user-level security under Microsoft Windows 95 and you are assigned
Custom permissions that do not include "Write to Files" permission.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
