The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, versions 4.2, 4.2.1, 4.2.1a,
   4.2.1b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office Setup program in maintenance mode, and
you choose the Remove All button to remove all of the Microsoft Office
files, some of the files are not removed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In general, when you run an application's Setup program in maintenance
mode, and you choose the Remove All button, a file is not removed if either
of the following is true:

<UL><LI>The file was not installed by the Setup program
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<LI>The file was installed by the Setup program, but the file is used by
   another application.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, you can manually delete any Microsoft Office
files that are not removed by the Setup program by dragging the files to
the trash. This will free up disk space on your hard disk drive.
<P>
For a list of the Microsoft Office files that are not removed when you use
the Remove All button in maintenance mode of the Setup program, see the
"Files Not Removed By Using Remove All" section at the end of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>FILES NOT REMOVED BY USING REMOVE ALL</h2>
 
<P>
Note that the following list includes only files that Microsoft Office
Setup installs. Files that are created when you run an application, such as
the Microsoft Word Normal Template (located in the Microsoft Office:
Microsoft Word 6: Templates: folder) are also not removed; however these
files are not included in the following list. If you have Apple System
Software 7.5.2 or greater the Shared Library Manager should not be removed.
Version 2.0 or higher of the Shared Library Manager is necessary for Apple
Talk to work on System 7.5.2
