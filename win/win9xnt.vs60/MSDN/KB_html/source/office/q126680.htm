The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.2, 4.3
<LI>Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, versions 4.2, 4.2.1
<LI>Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you remove an application from your hard drive that is listed on the
Microsoft Office Manager (MOM) menu or the MOM toolbar, the item is not
removed from MOM when the application files are removed from your hard
drive.
<P>
<P><h3>Macintosh</h3>
 
<P>
If you choose an item on the MOM menu on the Macintosh that has been
removed from the hard drive, you receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Could not find &lt;application&gt;

   -or-

   Could not continue because a resource is missing

</PRE>where &lt;application&gt; is the name of the application that has been removed
from your hard drive, such as Microsoft PowerPoint.
<P>
Additionally, the dialog box that appears when you choose the Edit button
for this item in the Microsoft Office Manager dialog box, the text "Unable
to locate this item" appears where the location of the item normally
appears.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows</h3>
 
<P>
If you choose an item on the MOM menu or from the MOM toolbar in Windows,
and that item has been removed from the hard drive, you receive the
following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find '&lt;filename&gt;'. Please start the application another way.
   While the application is running, click on the toolbar button or choose
   the menu command again.

</PRE>where &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the file hat has been removed from your
hard drive.
<P>
-or-
<P>
If the application was a custom item to the MOM menu, or the MOM toolbar,
you receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot execute '&lt;filename&gt;'. Please verify that it is a valid program
   file or use File Manager to create an association for the file.

</PRE>where &lt;filename&gt; is the path and filename of the application that has been
removed from your hard drive.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Office Manager. Once a menu item or
toolbar button is displayed on MOM, it remains on MOM until you choose not
to show it any more. MOM does not automatically remove items from the menu
or toolbar when you remove them from your hard drive.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, you can remove the item from MOM by doing the
following:
<P>
<P><h3>If You Are Using Office for the Macintosh</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the MOM menu, choose Customize.

<P><LI>If the application that you removed is a Microsoft Office
   application or an application that is automatically detected by MOM,
   clear the check box next to the item in the Office Manager Menu list.
   Note that these items cannot be removed; the Remove button is
   unavailable (gray) when you select the item.
<P>
   If the application is a custom item that you added, select the item
   in the Office Manager Menu list, and choose Remove.

<P><LI>Close the Microsoft Office Manager dialog box.
<P>
</OL><h3>If You Are Using Office for Windows</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From the Microsoft Office menu, choose Customize.

<P><LI>Select the Toolbar or the Menu tab, depending on which tool displays
   the removed application.

<P><LI>If the application that you removed is a Microsoft Office
   application, or an application that is automatically detected by MOM,
   clear the check box next to the item in the list of applications.
   Note that these items cannot be removed; the Remove button is
   unavailable (gray) when you select the item.
<P>
   If the application is a custom item that you added, select the item
   in the list of applications, and choose Remove.

<P><LI>Choose OK.
<P></OL>
