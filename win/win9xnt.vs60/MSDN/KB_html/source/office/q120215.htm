The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.2, 4.2b, 4.2c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a
<LI>Microsoft Project for Windows, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using one of the Office applications listed at the beginning of
this article, and you choose the Find File command from the File menu, your
computer may hang (stop responding).
<P>
Note that Find File WILL work properly in some Office applications.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because some entries in the MSFFILE.INI file are
incorrect.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Rename or delete the MSFFILE.INI file. (Note that renaming or deleting
   this file will remove all previously saved searches.)
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If the Find File is hanging on a specific search, you can use the
   [QuickList] section to locate the section heading for the corresponding
   saved search, and comment out that particular section of the file. For
   example, if Find File hangs on the search for .INI files in MOM, you
   would comment out the QL21 section in the following section of the
   MSFILE.INI file:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [QuickList]
      QL02=Budget Sheets
      QL01=My XL Sheets
      QL21=INI Files
      QL31=PPT Slides
</PRE><P>
</UL>To comment out a line in the MSFILE.INI file, position the cursor at the
appropriate line and type a semicolon (;).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Project, Microsoft PowerPoint, and Microsoft
Office Manager(MOM), write to the MSFFILE.INI file. There should be an
entry in the MSFFILE.INI file for each of the applications from which you
have accessed Find File. The sample section below from the MSFFILE.INI
indicates what number has been given to each application:
<P>
<PRE>   [Applications]
   Number=3
   Microsoft Excel=0
   Microsoft Project=1
   Microsoft Office=2
   Microsoft PowerPoint=3

</PRE>Each application number refers to a code for each of the saved searches
within that specific application. The MSFFILE.INI contains section headings
such as [QL01]. Where [QL00] is a saved search for Microsoft Excel, and
[QL20] and [QL21] are saved searches for Office.
<P>
Re-installing the application that is causing the problem does not correct
the problem with the Find File command. The MSFFILE.INI is created by Find
File the first time it is run. Microsoft Setup will not remove the
MSFFILE.INI because it does not have information about this file.
<P>
Note that Microsoft Word writes to the FILEMAN.INI file, located in your
Microsoft Windows directory. If Microsoft Word is the only application in
which you are having trouble using the Find File command, you can use
either of the workarounds listed above with the FILEMAN.INI file, instead
of the MSFILE.INI file.
