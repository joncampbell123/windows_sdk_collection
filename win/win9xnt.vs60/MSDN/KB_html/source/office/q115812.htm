The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.2, 4.3
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you upgrade to Microsoft Office from Microsoft Excel version
5.0, or Microsoft PowerPoint version 4.0, the Setup program does not
recognize either as a valid upgrade application. The Setup program
does not detect that either program is installed on your computer,
and you receive the following error message when you select the
directory that contains the application, or insert Disk 1 of the
application:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup was unable to recognize a valid application in this directory

</PRE>In the Setup program for the U.S. (domestic) versions of Microsoft
Office, you can continue with the Setup program and ignore this error
message. However, in the Setup program for an international version
of Microsoft Office, the Setup program does not allow you to
continue, and you can not install Microsoft Office.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Office version 4.0 shipped with Microsoft Word version 6.0,
but did not ship with Microsoft Excel version 5.0 or PowerPoint
version 4.0. Therefore, when you upgrade to Microsoft Office version
4.2 or 4.3, the Setup program checks for Microsoft Word for Windows
version 6.0, as a valid upgrade application, but does not check for
either Microsoft Excel or Microsoft PowerPoint.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
When you receive this error message in the U.S. version of the
Microsoft Office Setup program, you can choose the Continue button,
and Microsoft Office is installed.
<P>
To correct this problem when you are running an international version of
the Microsoft Office Setup program, you must obtain an updated version of
the COMPLINC.DLL that shipped with this version of Office. This file is
available in an application note.
<P>
To correct this problem when you are running an international version of
the Microsoft Office Setup program, you can obtain an updated version of
the COMPLINC.DLL file that corrects this problem by accessing the
application note WC1032 "Compliance Checker COMPLINC.DLL." For more
information about accessing this Application Note, query on the following
words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   AppNote and WC1032 and compliance

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft
products listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Office setup program uses compliance checking to verify that
you are eligible to upgrade from a previous version of Microsoft Office.
There are two levels of compliance checking: strict and lenient. Strict
compliance checking prevents you from installing Microsoft Office if you
cannot verify that you are eligible to upgrade. Lenient compliance checking
searches for or requests verification, but it does not prevent you from
installing the application if you do not provide appropriate verification.
<P>
The U.S. (domestic) versions of Microsoft Office uses lenient compliance
checking, so that you can install Microsoft Office even if you do not
provide the requested verification.
<P>
All international versions of Microsoft use strict compliance checking. To
upgrade an international version of Microsoft Office, you must have
Microsoft Office or one of the Microsoft Office applications installed, or
have Disk 1 from the disk sets of one of these applications.
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office version 4.2 or 4.3, (U.S. version),
the Setup program searches your system for Microsoft Word for Windows
version 6.0. If Setup does not find this application, you receive a
message requesting you to insert Disk 1 (the Setup disk) from the
Microsoft Word for Windows application. You can either insert the
appropriate disk or continue installing Microsoft Office. If you
continue without providing an appropriate disk or hard disk location,
another message is displayed to notify you that you have not provided
proper verification. If you again choose to continue without
providing the appropriate disk or hard disk location, Setup continues
and no further compliance checking messages appear.
<P>
However, when you install Microsoft Office version 4.2 or 4.3
(international version), and you do not have a previous version of
Microsoft Office or Microsoft Word for Windows version 6.0, the Setup
program does not continue, and you cannot install Microsoft Office.
The Setup program does not detect Microsoft Excel version 5.0, or
Microsoft PowerPoint version 4.0, even though you are eligible for
the Microsoft Office upgrade when you own one of these applications.
