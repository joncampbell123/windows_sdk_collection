   file.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>Your Microsoft Excel file was a Microsoft Excel Chart section when
   it was in the Binder.

<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel 97</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Using Windows Explorer, right-click the file and click Quick View on
   the shortcut menu.
<P>
   The file is opened in Quick View, but you cannot view the worksheet.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click "Open File for Editing."
<P>
   Microsoft Excel is started, and you can view and edit the workbook.
<P>

<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Quick View, which is installed by Microsoft Windows 95, allows you to view
documents that are created by Windows-based programs without starting the
program. If Quick View is not available on the shortcut menu, either the
program that created your file does not support Quick View or Quick View is
not installed on your computer. Please see your Windows 95 documentation
for information about how to install Quick View on your computer.
