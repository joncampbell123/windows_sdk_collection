Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, version 4.2.1b on CD, ships with over
40 templates and files specifically designed for owners of small
businesses. These templates are very similar to the templates included
with the Microsoft Office for Windows 95 Small Business Pack, and have
been modified to function on the Macintosh.
<P>

<P>
The templates and files included on disc 2 of the Microsoft Office for the
Macintosh, version 4.2lb, Bookshelf Business Tools bundle fall into six
