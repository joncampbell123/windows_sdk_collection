The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office Assistant for Windows, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you save the Microsoft Office Assistant compound document file
OAWHATIF.PPT in Microsoft PowerPoint, you receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   This file is read-only

</PRE>When you choose OK in the dialog box that displays this error
message, the Save As dialog box appears with the Windows directory as
the active directory.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message appears because the file is marked as Read Only when you
install the Microsoft Office Assistant. If you save the file to a directory
other than the directory to which you installed the Microsoft Office
Assistant, you are not able to open this file by selecting the filename in
the Microsoft Office Assistant. Instead, the original Read Only version
located in the directory to which you installed the Microsoft Office
Assistant is opened.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving this error message, change the properties of the
OAWHATIF.PPT file with the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>In File Manager, select the file OAWHATIF.PPT, located in the
   directory to which you installed the Microsoft Office Assistant.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Properties.

<P><LI>Under Attributes, clear the Read Only check box, and choose OK.
<P>
</OL>You are now able to save any changes that you make to this file.
<P>
To work around this problem when you have made changes to the OAWHATIF.PPT
file and you do not want to lose these changes, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Save the file with another filename, such as OAWHATI2.PPT, and close the
   file.

<P><LI>In File Manager, rename or delete the original OAWHATIF.PPT file.

<P><LI>Rename the file you saved in Step 1 to OAWHATIF.PPT, the original
   filename, in the directory to which you installed Microsoft Office
   Assistant.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you attempt to use the Save As dialog box to save the OAWHATIF.PPT
file to the same directory, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\MSOFFICE\OFFASST\AOWHATIF.PPT

   Sorry, the file or directory is write-protected.

</PRE></OL><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
