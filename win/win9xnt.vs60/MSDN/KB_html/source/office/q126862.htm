The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Project for Windows, versions 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Word for Windows, when you search for a file in Find File, you may
receive the error message
<P>
<PRE>   No Matching Files Found

</PRE>In Microsoft Excel for Windows or Microsoft Project for Windows, the same
search in Find File yields the error message
<P>
<PRE>   The directory '&lt;directory&gt;' doesn't exist or is inaccessible. Check
   your typing. Do you want to skip this path during the search?

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This happens when the name of the directory you are searching contains a
character between 128 and 255. These characters are not available directly
from the keyboard and include such characters as international symbols,
spaces, and graphical characters.
<P>
Each character available to the operating system has a unique number. MS-
DOS reserves characters 0 through 31 for control characters. The keyboard
contains characters 32 through 127. The characters 128 through 255 are
referred to as "extended characters."
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
