The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Regular Index rather than the Speed Up Phrase Searching,
you may not see an improvement in search times.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
An index that uses Speed Up Phrase Searching includes proximity information
for each word in the index. A regular index will have information stating
that "word" is located in "doc1." A Speed Up Phrase Searching index will
have information stating that "word" is located in "doc1" at position x, y,
and z.
<P>
Take for example the phrase "word1 word2 word 3" (you must include the
quotation marks to denote a phrase):

<UL><LI>An index with Speed Up Phrase Searching, will have this information and
   the results will be returned faster.

<LI>In a regular index (one without Speed Up Phrase Searching), the query
   will be converted to search for 'word1 and word2 and word3' all in the
   same file. The index will have this information and the results will be
   returned quickly. Then, of the results (from that search), the original
   phrase "word1 word2 word3" will be searched for, but as if there was no
   index. Hence, the results for the final search are returned somewhat
   slower when compared with the index with Speed Up Phrase Searching.
<P>
</UL>The speed differences will be noticed on larger file sets, especially over
a network. If you do not see any appreciable speed difference, you may want
to save hard disk space and use the regular index.
<P>
To change enable Speed Up Phrase Searching, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start on the Task Bar and point to Settings.

<P><LI>Click Control Panel and double-click the Find Fast icon.

<P><LI>Click Create Index on the Index menu. Select the Speed Up Phrase
   Searching check box.
