<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the products listed above, when you click Open on the File menu, select
a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) site, and then click Open, error messages
similar to the following may appear:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot connect to the FTP server on the computer named
   'ftp.microsoft.com'.

   -and-

   The folder '<B><A href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/'">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/'</A></B> isn't accessible. The folder may
   be located on an unavailable volume or protected with a password.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if you are connected to the Internet by a proxy
server, and the FTP proxy settings are not set correctly in Microsoft
Internet Explorer, version 3.0, 3.01 or 3.02.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, correct the FTP proxy settings. To
do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click Internet.

<P><LI>Click the Connection tab.

<P><LI>Under Proxy Server, click Settings.

<P><LI>Under Servers, clear (uncheck) the "Use the same proxy server for all
   protocols" check box.

<P><LI>In the FTP box, type the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for your FTP
   gateway server. The following example illustrates the syntax to use:
<P>
<P><PRE>      <B>ftp://ftpgate</B>
</PRE>
<P><LI>Clear the Port box to the right of the FTP box.

<P><LI>Click OK. Then, click OK again and close the Control Panel window.
<P>
</OL>You should be able to connect to an FTP site from within the Open dialog
box of the products listed at the beginning of this article.
<P>
If you still cannot connect to an FTP site, check with your network
administrator and determine whether you are referring to the correct FTP
gateway server. Or, click Open on the File menu, click "Add/Modify FTP
Locations" in the Look In box, click the name of the FTP server to which
you want to connect, and then click Remove. After you remove the location,
type the FTP servers name in the "Name of FTP Site" box and click OK. Note
that you may need to quit and restart the program before you connect
to an external FTP site.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
The behavior is by design of Microsoft Office 97 and Microsoft Internet
Explorer, versions 3.0, 3.01 and 3.02.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the products listed at the beginning of this article, you can use the
Open dialog box to connect to an FTP site on the Internet and a local
intranet. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Open.

<P><LI>In the Look In box, if the FTP site to which you want to connect is
   listed, click the name of the FTP site.
<P>
   If the FTP site is NOT listed, click "Add/Modify FTP Locations." Then,
   type the name of the FTP site you want to access, select a logon type,
   and then click OK. In the Open dialog box, click the name of the FTP
   site you want to access and click Open.
<P>
</OL>The contents of the FTP site are listed in the Open dialog box. You can
open folders and files as if they were stored on your local hard disk.
<P>
When you access an external FTP site through Microsoft Internet Explorer,
only the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) proxy settings must be correct.
This is true because Microsoft Internet Explorer uses the HTTP protocol
(the standard protocol for accessing information on the World Wide Web) to
emulate FTP when you connect to an FTP site.
<P>
The programs listed at the beginning of this article require that the FTP
proxy settings be correct when you access an external FTP site. This is
because these programs do not use the HTTP protocol to emulate FTP;
instead, the FTP proxy settings are used. If you select the "Use the same
proxy server for all protocols" check box in the Internet icon in the
Control Panel, you may be unable to access external FTP sites with
Microsoft Office 97 programs.
