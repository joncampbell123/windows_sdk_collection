The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you delete a button from the Office Shortcut Bar, and then click No in
the dialog box that appears asking if you are sure you want to delete the
button, the Office Shortcut Bar may begin flickering rapidly, and may stop
responding. Additionally, if you move your mouse pointer over the Office
Shortcut Bar when this happens, the mouse pointer may be displayed as an
hourglass, as if the computer is waiting for the Shortcut Bar to perform
some action.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if you add a toolbar to the Office Shortcut Bar, add a
button to the new toolbar, and then delete the button that you added,
without closing the Customize dialog box between any of these actions, and
you then choose not to delete the buttons.
<P>
When you delete a button from a toolbar on the Office Shortcut Bar, you
receive a dialog box with the following message when you close the
Customize dialog box
<P>
<PRE>   Are you sure you want to delete the buttons listed below? The programs,
   files, and content of any folders that are represented by the deleted
   button will be permanently lost.
   &lt;filename1&gt;, &lt;filename2&gt;, ...

</PRE>where &lt;filename1&gt; and &lt;filename2&gt; are the buttons that you deleted. Under
the above conditions, if you click No in this dialog box, the Shortcut Bar
begins to flicker, and stops responding.
<P>
Note that this behavior occurs only if you add a new toolbar, add a button
to the new toolbar, delete the new button, and then click No in the dialog
box asking if you are sure you want to delete the button. If you close the
Customize dialog box after creating the toolbar or adding the button, this
problem does not occur.
<P>
When you run the Shortcut Bar again after this problem occurs, the
following additional symptoms may occur:

<UL><LI>The Shortcut Bar appears in a new location on the screen

<LI>The new toolbar that you added before this problem occurred does not
   appear on the Office Shortcut Bar

<LI>If you attempt to add a new toolbar with the same name as the toolbar
   that you added when this problem occurred, such as &lt;toolbar&gt;, you
   receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Cannot create a blank toolbar called "&lt;toolbar&gt;" because there is a
      previously deleted toolbar by that name. Do you want to add the
      previously deleted toolbar instead.
</PRE><P>
   If you click Yes, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The toolbar name "&lt;toolbar&gt;" is being reserved for future use
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, when the Office Shortcut Bar has stopped
responding, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE.

<P><LI>In the Close Program dialog box, click the Microsoft Office Shortcut
   Bar, and click End Task.

<P><LI>If a dialog box appears indicating that the program is not
   responding, click End Task.
<P>
</OL>If the Office Shortcut Bar does not close, repeat Steps 1-3 above.
<P>
To avoid this behavior, do not delete a button from a custom toolbar if you
have not closed the Customize dialog box since adding the button. In other
words, when you add a button to a custom toolbar, if you decide you don't
want the button added after all, close the Customize dialog box before you
delete this button.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
