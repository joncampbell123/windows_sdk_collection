<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you view the properties of a file in the Properties dialog box using
My Computer, Windows Explorer, or the program that created the file, the
Created and/or Accessed field may contain the value (unknown) or the
field may be empty (no value).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when you view the properties of a file that is
located on a computer that is running the MS-DOS operating system and 16-
bit Windows. For example, if you view the properties of a file located on
a network drive, where the network server is running Windows for
Workgroups 3.11, the Created and Accessed fields in the Properties dialog
box contain the value (unknown) or do not contain a value.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Created and Accessed values that appear when you use Explorer or My
Computer to view the file properties are different in this case than the
Created and Accessed values that appear when you view the file properties
in the program that created the file.
<P>
<P><h3>Explorer or My Computer</h3>
 
<P>
When you view the properties of a file using the Explorer or My Computer,
the Created and Accessed fields on both the General tab and the
Statistics tab in the Properties dialog box contain the value (unknown)
if the file is located on a computer that is running the MS-DOS operating
system and 16- bit Windows.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
When you open a workbook that is located on a computer that is running
the MS-DOS operating system and 16-bit Windows, if you open the
Properties dialog box, the Created and Accessed fields on the General tab
contain the value (unknown). The Created and Accessed fields on the
Statistics tab are blank (do not contain a value).
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint</h3>
 
<P>
When you open a document (in Word) or a slide (in PowerPoint) that is
located on a computer that is running the MS-DOS operating system and 16-
bit Windows, if you open the Properties dialog box, the Created and
Accessed fields on the General tab contain the value (unknown). The
Created field on the Statistics tab contains the correct date, the date
that the file was created. The Accessed field on the Statistics tab is
blank (does not contain a value).
