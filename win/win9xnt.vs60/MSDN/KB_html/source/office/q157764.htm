The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT, versions 3.51, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install the Timex Data Link Watch Wizard, you may receive the
following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   You do not have administrator privileges on this machine. Some
   installations cannot be completed correctly unless they are run by an
   administrator.

   Do you want to continue?

</PRE>If you continue the installation, you eventually receive the error message:
<P>
<PRE>   INF Install failure. Reason: Unknown

</PRE>and the Timex Data Link Watch Wizard is not successfully installed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This will occur if the following conditions are all true:

<UL><LI>You attempt to install one of the Timex Data Link Watch Wizard files
   included in the Microsoft Office 97 Value Pack.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You are using a computer running Windows NT, version 3.51 or 4.0.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You are not logged on as an administrator.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, log on to the computer as an
administrator before installing the Timex Data Link Watch Wizard. Once
installation is complete, you can log back on as a normal user.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of the Timex Data Link Watch Wizard included
with Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Timex Data Link Watch, produced by Timex Corporation, receives
information exported from Microsoft Outlook.
<P>
You can install the Timex Data Link Watch Wizard so that Microsoft Outlook
can export any of the following to the watch: appointments, tasks, phone
numbers, anniversaries, birthdays, reminders, and current time and time
zone information.
<P>
The Timex Data Link Watch Wizard is installed by running one of two
separate files:

   --------------------------------------------

   Timexnt.exe    Windows NT 3.51
   Timexwiz.exe   Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0

</PRE>These files are located in the \ValuPack\Timex folder on your Microsoft
Office 97 CD-ROM.
<P>
NOTE: You must have Microsoft Outlook installed on your computer in order
to install the Timex Data Link Watch Wizard.
