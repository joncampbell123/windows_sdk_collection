<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office Professional for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT, version 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you try to use Microsoft Bookshelf 95 in Microsoft Windows NT version
3.51, you may receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   The wrong volume is in the drive. Please insert volume OFFICE95PRO into
   Drive &lt;CD-ROM drive&gt;

</PRE>You have an option to click Abort, Retry, or Ignore. If you click Retry,
the above error message continues to appear. If you click either Abort
or Ignore, you may receive an additional Dr. Watson for NT error message
stating that an application error has occurred.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if both of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You performed a "Run from CD" installation of Microsoft Office
   Professional for Windows 95.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You had Disc 1 of the Office Professional CD-ROM discs in your CD-ROM
   drive when you tried to use Microsoft Bookshelf 95 (either by clicking
   the icon on the Office Shortcut Bar or by clicking a menu command from
   within one of the Office programs).
<P>
</UL>When Microsoft Office Professional for Windows 95 and Microsoft Bookshelf
95 are installed with the "Run from CD" option, you need to have Disc 2 in
your CD-ROM drive before you start any of the Office programs or before
you try to use Microsoft Bookshelf.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, click Abort or Ignore when you receive the
error message. When you receive the Dr. Watson for NT error message, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Press CTRL+ESC to bring up the Task List.

<P><LI>Select Dr. Watson for NT, and then click End Task.

<P><LI>Press CTRL+ESC to bring up the Task List again.

<P><LI>Select System Process - Wrong Volume, and then click End Task.

<P><LI>Click Abort.
<P>
</OL>Note, at this point, your machine may be unstable and you may receive
another Dr. Watson for NT error if you try to save your work, assuming you
were using one of the Office programs when you tried to use Bookshelf. In
order to have a good chance at saving your work, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Eject Disc 2 of the Office Professional CD-ROM discs from your
   CD-ROM drive.

<P><LI>Insert Disc 1 of the Office Professional CD-ROM discs into your
   CD-ROM drive.

<P><LI>Click Save on the File menu.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
One of the setup installation options for Microsoft Office Professional for
Windows 95 is "Run from CD." This setup option is performed using Disc 1 of
the two CD-ROM discs included with Office Professional and Bookshelf 95.
When the Setup program has completed successfully, you are not advised to
use Disc 2 if you want to run any of the Office programs or if you want to
use Bookshelf. But, on both of the CD-ROM discs, there is a note stating
Disc 2 must be in the CD-ROM drive if you chose the "Run from CD" setup
option.
<P>
If you fail to take notice of this note, and you leave Disc 1 in the CD-ROM
drive, you can still successfully start any of the Office programs. But,
if you then try to use Bookshelf, you may receive the  error messages
described in the "Symptoms" section of this article.
