The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you create a system policy that restricts users from exploring their
computers by using Windows Explorer or within My Computer, users can still
explore files and folders within the individual Microsoft Office programs
within the Open and Save As dialog boxes.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you run the Policy Editor program and, by using
the Common.adm policy template, restrict access to the Windows shell by
hiding drives and Windows Explorer.
<P>
However, Word 97 and Excel 97 use a different means of accessing the
directory structure. When users, even with the restricted access, are
in the Open or Save As dialog box, they will be able to browse all folders
on drives by either double-clicking folders or clicking the drive drop-down
arrow.
<P>
There are no options in the Microsoft Office 97 policy files to disable
this functionality of the Open and Save As dialog boxes. This functionality
cannot be disabled because no system registry option exists in the
Microsoft Office 97 programs to switch it on or off. The ability to browse
drives and folder is an inherent function of these dialog boxes.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit includes a collection of templates
that you can use with the System Policy Editor to specify user policies
for the Office programs.
<P>
You can edit the registry by using System Policy Editor (Poledit.exe) or
Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). However, check with your network
administrator before you make any changes to the registry.
<P>
If you are using the Office 97 system policy templates that are included
in the Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit, you must use the version of the
System Policy Editor that is included in the Microsoft Office 97 Resource
Kit or the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit.
<P>
NOTE: You can download Policy.exe, a self-extracting executable file
containing Poledit.exe, from online services. Download this file from
the following Web site:
