The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Microsoft Query, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   The application "Microsoft Query" has unexpectedly quit, because an
   error of type 10 occurred.

   You should save your work in other open applications and restart the
   computer.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You have installed Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition on your
   computer by dragging the Microsoft Office 98 folder to your hard
   disk, but you have not yet run any of the following programs included
   in Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
      Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
      Microsoft PowerPoint 98 Macintosh Edition
</PRE><P>
   -and-

<LI>You start Microsoft Query by double-clicking the icon in the Microsoft
   Office 98:Office folder.
<P>
</UL>Specifically, the problem occurs because files required by Microsoft Query
are not completely installed until you run one of the Office programs. When
you run any of these programs, the first run installation process finishes
installing Microsoft Office 98 and all of the Office support files.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, start Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition,
Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition, or Microsoft PowerPoint 98 Macintosh
Edition. As soon as the program starts successfully, quit the program. You
can then run Microsoft Query.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition by dragging the
Microsoft Office 98 folder to your hard disk, some of the files used by the
programs are not copied to the System Folder. When you run any of the
Office programs, the Microsoft Office first run installation process
automatically completes the installation of the necessary files, and you
can run the programs. For additional information about the first run
installation process, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : OFF98: Using First Run Installation to Troubleshoot Mac
               Office

</PRE>If you install Microsoft Query from the Value Pack and attempt to run it
before you run any of the other programs included in Microsoft Office 98
Macintosh Edition, you receive the error message described in this article.
