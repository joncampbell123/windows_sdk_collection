The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, version 4.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office Setup program, and you choose the
Complete/Custom installation option, the Change Folder button in the
Microsoft Office 4.2 Setup dialog box is unavailable (gray) when you select
any of the items in the Options list, such as Microsoft Word or Microsoft
Excel.
<P>
NOTE: Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, version 4.2 (PPC), does not have
this limitation. With this version of Office, the applications can be
installed to any folder.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You cannot change the location of the individual Microsoft Office
applications, that is Microsoft Excel, Word, PowerPoint, or the Microsoft
Office Manager. Each of these applications is installed to a folder in the
Microsoft Office folder. For example, Microsoft Word is installed to a
Microsoft Word folder in the Microsoft Office folder.
<P>
However, you can change the location of some of the components of the
Microsoft Office applications. The following is a list of the components
that you can install to a folder other than the default folder using the
Change Folder button in the Microsoft Office 4.2 Setup dialog box:
<P>
<PRE>   *Microsoft Word
      Online Help
         Word Help
         Examples and Demos
         WordBasic Help
         Technical Support Help
         Word Readme Help
      Wizards, Templates and Letters
         Templates and Wizards
         Letters
         Macro Templates
      Word Clip Art
   *Microsoft PowerPoint
      Clip Art Files

</PRE>* Although you cannot change the location of Microsoft Word or Microsoft
PowerPoint, they are listed as a reference for their components above.
<P>
Note that you CAN change the folder to which you install Microsoft Office,
after you select a destination folder in the initial Setup dialog box, by
using the Change Folder button in the Setup dialog box that displays the
installation options, such as Minimum, Complete/Custom, and Typical.
However, this changes the destination folder for all of the Microsoft
Office applications.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Office for the Power Macintosh, version 4.2.
<P>
In Microsoft Office for the Power Macintosh, you can change the location of
Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint or Word individually. When you install this
version of Microsoft Office, the Change Folder button (in the dialog box
that appears after you choose the Complete/Custom installation option) is
available. Note that in the Microsoft Office for the Power Macintosh Setup,
you still cannot change the location of Microsoft Office Manager.
