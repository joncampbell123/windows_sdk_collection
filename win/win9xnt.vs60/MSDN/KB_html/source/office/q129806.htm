The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.2, 4.2c, 4.3, 4.3c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a custom setup script that was sent through Microsoft Mail,
you will receive the following alert messages from Mail
<P>
<PRE>   Do you want to update the Package

   -and-

   Do you want to save changes to '&lt;subject&gt;'

</PRE>where &lt;subject&gt; is the subject of the mail message in which the script was
sent.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If Microsoft Office is installed in a shared network directory and a custom
setup script is created to automate Setup, that setup script can be
distributed as an icon through Mail; you can use this icon to automatically
run the script.
<P>
To complete the installation, Setup must restart Windows. Just before
Windows is restarted, the following error message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup needs to restart Windows to complete the installation of
   system files. Please close all applications, including MS-DOS sessions,
   after saving any current work and then return to this dialog box and
   choose the Continue button.

</PRE>When Windows is restarted, any open applications that have not been closed
are shut down automatically. If Mail is not shut down before this restart,
and if the Mail message containing the setup icon has not been closed, you
will receive the error messages described above.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This is expected behavior. The Office Setup program does not control these
messages.
