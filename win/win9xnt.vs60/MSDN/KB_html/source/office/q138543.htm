<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you set up Office 7.0 on a computer that has a Trident 9440 PCI video
display, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   An error has occurred in your program. To keep working anyway,
   click ignore and save your work in a new file. To Quit this
   program, click Close. You will lose information you entered since
   your last save.

</PRE>If you click Close, you may receive another error message:
<P>
<PRE>   ACMSETUP caused a General Protection Fault in module AGIDLV.DRV.

</PRE>This error message occurs when Setup begins copying files.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Set the display driver for standard VGA before you attempt to install
Office 7.0. When setup is complete, you can reset the display for the
Trident driver.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When Windows 95 is started, it detects the Trident 9440 as a PCI VGA video
card. Windows searches the hard disk for video drivers specifically for
this card and cannot find one. It then prompts for the drivers disk to
install the proper video driver. The drivers that come with the card are
for Windows 3.x, and they will be installed in Windows 95. The drivers work
in Windows 95, as well as with other applications, such as the Plus! Pack
for Windows 95 with no problems.
<P>
Trident is working on drivers for Windows 95, and will be available on
CompuServe and the Trident BBS when completed. The following are support
numbers for Trident:

   (415) 691-1016  BBS (9600 baud)
   (415) 335-1179  Automated driver ordering
