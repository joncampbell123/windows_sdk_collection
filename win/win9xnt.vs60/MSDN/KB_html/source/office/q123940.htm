The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using a version of Microsoft Office that was installed on your
computer when you bought it, you may receive the following error message
when you run Office Setup in maintenance mode:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;Server path&gt;\DISK1\ACMSETUP.EX_ could not be found

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When Microsoft Office is installed, the original source directory location
is written to a line in the SETUP.STF file. When you run Setup in
maintenance mode, this line is used to find the source files or to prompt
you to insert disks.
<P>
Some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) pre-install Microsoft Office
on bundled systems from a server installation. If your version of Office
was installed this way, Setup attempts to find the Setup disks at the
original server location. When the original server installation source
cannot be found, you receive the error message mentioned above.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, either reinstall Microsoft Office from disks, or
edit the SETUP.STF file to change the "Source Directory" line to point to
your floppy disk drive rather than to the server.
<P>
<P><h3>To edit the .STF file</h3>
 
<P>
WARNING: This modification is not supported by Microsoft Product Support
Services (PSS). Although PSS will support some modifications to a BACKUP
copy of the SETUP.STF file, PSS will NOT support modification of the
SETUP.INF file. Note also that while PSS will help customers modify
specific lines of an STF, we will not rewrite the entire file in order to
achieve a desired configuration. As a general rule, support is limited to
options that can normally be changed by a user during a standard
installation of the application.

<OL><P><LI>Make a backup copy of the SETUP.STF file.

<P><LI>In Microsoft Excel, open the SETUP.STF file.

<P><LI>In the Text Import Wizard dialog box, choose Next until Step
   3 Of 3 appears.

<P><LI>In the Text Import Wizard Step 3 Of 3 dialog box, under Data
   Preview, click the second column to select it. Under Column Data
   Format, select the Text option, and choose Finish.

<P><LI>In the first column of the .STF, search for the rows that contain the
   following entries:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Source Directory
      MSAPPS Mode
</PRE>
<P><LI>In the cell to the right of the Source Directory entry, change the path
   to point to your floppy disk drive.

<P><LI>In the cell to the right of the MSAPPS Mode entry, change the "user-
   choice" entry to "local" (without the quotation marks).

<P><LI>Save the changes to the SETUP.STF file and Exit Microsoft Excel. Be
   sure to choose "No" if you are prompted to save the SETUP.STF as a
   Microsoft Excel workbook.
<P>
</OL>You should now be able to run Microsoft Office Setup in maintenance mode.
