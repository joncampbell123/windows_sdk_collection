The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office version 7.0 for Windows 95 over an
existing version of Microsoft Office, the icons for your existing version
of Microsoft Office are not removed, and the Startup menu still contains
the icons for your previous Microsoft Office applications.
<P>
When you click the icon for Microsoft Office, or Microsoft Office Setup (on
the Microsoft Office menu) Microsoft Windows searches for the missing file,
and you receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   The item '&lt;app file&gt;' that this shortcut refers to has been changed
   or moved. The nearest match, based on size, date, and type, is
   '&lt;filename&gt;'. Do you want this shortcut to point to this item?

</PRE>where &lt;app file&gt; is MSOFFICE.EXE (Microsoft Office) or SETUP.EXE (Microsoft
Setup) and &lt;filename&gt; is the file that most closely matches the missing
file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office version 7.0 over an existing version of
Microsoft Office, most of the Office files for the existing version are
removed and replaced by updated copies of the files. However, the icons for
the applications are not removed in this case, because the Office version
7.0 Setup program does not detect which icons in the Microsoft Office
folder can be removed. For example, if you have icons for Microsoft Access,
or Microsoft Project in the Microsoft Office folder, these icons should not
be removed by the Office Setup program.
<P>
When you install Microsoft Windows version 95 over Windows version 3.x,
your existing Windows 3.x program groups are added to the Start menu. The
Microsoft Office group is added to the Programs menu on the Start menu, and
your Office application icons are available on the Microsoft Office menu.
When you install Microsoft Office version 7.0, the new Office applications
icons are added to the Programs menu. The new Office application icons are
then available on the Programs menu, and the existing Office application
icons are available on the Microsoft Office menu (on the Programs menu)
even though some of these icons are for programs that are no longer on your
computer.
<P>
Note that you may not receive an error message when you click an icon for a
previous version of an Office application that has been removed, because
the new version is installed to the same location. However, you receive an
error message when you click the Microsoft Office icon because the
MSOFFICE.EXE file is installed to the Microsoft Office directory in
previous versions of Office, but the MSOFFICE.EXE file for Office version
7.0 is installed to the MSOFFICE\OFFICE folder (where MSOFFICE is the
folder to which you installed Office). Similarly, the SETUP.EXE file is
installed to the SETUP directory in the Microsoft Office directory in
previous versions of Office, but Microsoft Office version 7.0 installs the
SETUP.EXE file to the MSOFFICE\OFFICE\SETUP folder.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, use any of the following methods:
<P>
Method 1: Before you install Microsoft Office version 7.0, run the Setup
<PRE>          program for the previous version of Microsoft Office in
          maintenance mode, and choose Remove All to remove the icons for
          the existing Office applications. This will prevent duplication
          of icons for Microsoft Office on the Start menu.

</PRE>Method 2: If you have already installed Microsoft Office version 7.0, and
<PRE>          have duplicate items on the Start menu, do the following to
          remove the items from the Start menu.

          a. On the Windows taskbar, click Start.

          b. Click Settings, and then click Taskbar.

          c. Click the Start Menu Programs tab. Under Customize Start Menu,
             click Remove.

          d. Double-click the Microsoft Office folder. Click the individual
             icon that you want to delete, and then click Remove. Continue
             until all the desired icons are removed.

          e. Close the Remove Shortcuts/Folders dialog box and then close
             the Taskbar Properties dialog box.
