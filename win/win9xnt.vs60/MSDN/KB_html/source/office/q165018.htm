The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Exchange client, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Exchange client version 4.0, if you click New Message on
the toolbar, or if you click New Message on the Compose menu, you may
receive one of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Exchange
   The item could not be opened. MAPI Error.

   -or-

   Microsoft Exchange
   The item could not be displayed. MAPI Error.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You install the following programs on your computer, in the following
   order:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Exchange client version 4.0
      Microsoft Word 97 (the stand-alone version, in its own folder)
      Microsoft Office 97 (without Microsoft Word 97, in a another folder)
</PRE><P>
   -and-

<LI>You configure the Microsoft Exchange client to use Microsoft Word as
   the e-mail editor (WordMail).
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You remove all of Microsoft Office 97 (except for Microsoft Word 97)
   from the computer.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>When you are prompted to remove shared components, such as Windows
   Messaging, you click Keep.
<P>
</UL>This problem occurs because the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program removes
the registry settings that are used by WordMail when you click Remove All
to remove all of Microsoft Office 97. The registry settings are removed
even if they are used by other programs, such as Microsoft Exchange.
<P>
After the Setup program removes registry settings, Microsoft Exchange
cannot use WordMail, even though Microsoft Word 97 is installed on the
computer.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, reinstall Microsoft Word 97. To do this, use the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click Add/Remove Programs. Then, click the Install/Uninstall
   tab.

<P><LI>In the list of installed programs, click Microsoft Word 97. Then,
   click Add/Remove.

<P><LI>In the Microsoft Word 97 Setup dialog box, click Reinstall.
<P>
</OL>The Setup program recreates all of the registry settings that are used by
Microsoft Word 97, including the WordMail registry settings, which are
required by Microsoft Exchange.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Exchange, you can use the following two methods to edit and
read e-mail messages:

<UL><LI>You can use the built-in editor.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You can use Microsoft Word as the e-mail editor. (This method is also
   called WordMail.)
<P>
</UL>To make WordMail available, click WordMail Options on the Compose menu.
Click to select the "Enable Word as e-mail editor" check box, and then
click Close.
<P>
If you remove all of Microsoft Office 97 from the computer, you may not be
able to use the WordMail option in Microsoft Exchange unless you first
reinstall Microsoft Word.
