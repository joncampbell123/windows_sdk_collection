The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.2, 4.2-CD, 4.3,
   4.3-CD

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you install the Microsoft Office Manager (MOM), some of the
applications on the toolbar are added automatically. The following
information discusses how the Microsoft Office Manager (MOM) toolbar in
Microsoft Office locates a "registered" application, or an application that
appears on the MOM toolbar by default when you install MOM.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Locating A Registered Application</h3>
 
<P>
MOM uses information in the REG.DAT file to determine the location of the
applications on your computer. For Microsoft Access 1.x, Microsoft FoxPro
versions earlier than 2.5b, Microsoft Publisher, and Microsoft Mail,
applications that are not registered in the REG.DAT file, MOM checks the
[Extensions] section of the WIN.INI file and uses the path information for
the .MDB, .DBF (as long as the executable is FOXPROW.EXE), .PUB, and .MMF
extensions respectively. MOM then registers this path information under the
MSToolbar key in the REG.DAT file.
<P>
<P><h3>Learning Correct Location</h3>
 
<P>
If MOM cannot find a registered application because of incorrect,
incomplete or missing information in the REG.DAT file, or the WIN.INI file,
but the application is installed on the computer, MOM can "learn" its
location. When you start the application by choosing the button on the MOM
toolbar or choosing the application from the Microsoft Office menu, an
error message is displayed asking you to start the application another way
(for example, by using Program Manager or File Manager) and to then click
the button or choose the menu item again. When you do this, the application
is registered under the MSToolbar key in the REG.DAT file.
<P>
<P><h3>Finding The Most Current version</h3>
 
<P>
When you start a registered application, such as Microsoft Excel, by using
the MOM toolbar, MOM searches for the most current version of this
application before running it. MOM finds the most current version by
searching for the CurVer key in the REG.DAT file, getting the information
corresponding to that key and then using this information to locate the
command line for the application.
<P>
<P><h3>Starting Different Versions Of An Application</h3>
 
<P>
When you start a version of an application that is different than the
version that is registered as the current version in the REG.DAT file, and
you then choose the registered application's button on the MOM toolbar, an
entry is added to the MSToolbar section of the REG.DAT file indicating the
path of the version of the application that is running.
<P>
Using MOM version 4.0, when you choose the application's button again from
the toolbar during the same MOM session, the non-current version is
started. However, if you close MOM, and then start it again, the current
version of the application as registered in the REG.DAT file is started.
<P>
For example, if Microsoft Word 6.0 is installed, but you work in Microsoft
Word 2.0, if you choose the Microsoft Word button from the MOM toolbar
while Microsoft Word 2.0 is running, the Microsoft Word button on the MOM
toolbar now starts Microsoft Word 2.0 instead of version 6.0 until you
close MOM and start it again.
<P>
Note that using MOM versions 4.2 and 4.3, when you close the non-current
version of the application (Microsoft Word 2.0), and then choose the
application's button from the toolbar, the current version (Microsoft Word
6.0) is started.
