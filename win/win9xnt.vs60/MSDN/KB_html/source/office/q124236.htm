The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, version 4.2
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, version 6.0.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office version 4.2 Setup program in maintenance
mode, you receive the following error message after you insert Install
Disk 1
<P>
<PRE>   While attempting the installation shown below, Setup was unable to
   access the indicated source or destination file:

   Source file: &lt;Volume offline&gt;:Excel English Lexicon

   Destination file: Macintosh HD:Microsoft Office:Microsoft Excel
                     5:Excel English Lexicon

</PRE>where Macintosh HD is the name of your hard disk drive, Microsoft Office is
the folder that you installed Microsoft Office to, and Excel 5 is your
Microsoft Excel folder. Note that the filename "Excel English Lexicon" in
the above error message may be different.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if you run the Setup program by double-clicking the
Microsoft Office Setup file located in the Microsoft Office folder on your
hard drive. The error message appears when you insert Install Disk 1, after
the Setup program prompts you to insert this disk. The Setup program
prompts you to insert this disk if you choose the Add/Remove button or the
Reinstall button in the maintenance program dialog box to install a new
component, or to reinstall the application files.
<P>
If you choose the Reinstall button, and you installed the Microsoft Excel
application when you ran the Microsoft Office Setup the first time, you
receive the error message above, where the error message references the
"Excel English Lexicon" file.
<P>
You may also receive this error message, where the error message references
the "Examples and Demos" file if you choose the Add/Remove button, and you
choose to install the Examples and Demos component while running Setup in
maintenance mode installation.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving this error message when you run the Microsoft Office
Setup program in maintenance mode to reinstall the application files or to
install new components, run the Setup file located on Install Disk 1 of the
Microsoft Office Setup disks, instead of running the Setup file located on
your hard disk drive.
<P>
If you do receive this message, search for the "Excel English Lexicon" file
and check to see if it has a file size of zero bytes. If so, delete the
file.
<P>
Additionally, drag the Embedding Preferences file, the PPC Registration
Database file, and the Registration Database file from the Preferences
folder to the desktop, then run Setup again from Disk 1.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
