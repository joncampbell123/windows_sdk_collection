<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
On a computer running Windows NT version 3.51, when you insert an object in
one of the programs listed at the beginning of this article, one of the
following error messages appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot start the source application for this object.

   - or -

   The server application, source file, or item cannot be found.
   Make sure the application is properly installed, and that it has
   not been deleted, moved, or renamed.

</PRE>When you insert a section into a Microsoft Office Binder, the following
error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Office Binder cannot add the section to the binder. This type of
   file may not be supported by Office binder. An unexpected error
   has occurred.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems occur when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You install the Office program in a folder with a name that begins
   with "Microsoft Office" followed by a space and additional characters.
   For example, you install Microsoft Office in a folder named "Microsoft
   Office Pro."
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You install a component program from the ValuPack into a folder
   named "Microsoft Office." For example, you install the Microsoft
   Camcorder in the Microsoft Office\Mscam folder.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, remove the ValuPack and the Office
program, and then reinstall the programs. Note that you must install the
ValuPack program in the same folder in which you install Microsoft Office.
To do this, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Run Setup for the ValuPack program and click Remove All.

<P><LI>Run Setup for Microsoft Office and click Remove All.

<P><LI>Run Microsoft Office Setup again, select the program you want to
   reinstall and install it.

<P><LI>Run Setup for the ValuPack program. When you are prompted to select a
   folder in which to install the program, click Browse and select the same
   folder in which you installed Microsoft Office.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
