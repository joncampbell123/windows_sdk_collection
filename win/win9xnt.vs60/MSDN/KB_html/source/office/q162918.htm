The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows, all editions
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program, you may notice the
following problems in the "billboard" images that appear in the upper-left
corner of the screen:

<UL><LI>The text in each billboard is too wide and is cut off by the right
   edge of the billboard.

<LI>The text in each billboard runs off the bottom of the billboard.

<LI>The bullets to the left of each sentence of text appear as lines (|)
   instead of bullets.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems will occur if the Arial font is not installed in the
appropriate location on your computer. Normally, the Arial font file,
Arial.ttf, is located in the following folders:
<P>
<PRE>   Operating System           Folder
   -------------------------------------------

   Microsoft Windows 95       C:\Windows\Fonts
   Microsoft Windows NT 4.0   C:\Winnt\Fonts

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem by reinstalling the Arial font file, use the method
appropriate for your operating system:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Microsoft Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
If the Arial font is not installed on your computer, please see the
following article in the Knowledge Base for information on how to reinstall
the missing font(s):
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../win95x/q152974.htm">Q152974</A></B>
   TITLE     : How to Restore the Default Fonts in Windows 95

</PRE>After the default fonts (including the Arial font) have been reinstalled,
the fonts should display correctly when you run the Microsoft Office 97
Setup program.
<P>
Method 2: Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
 
<P>
If the Arial font is not installed on your computer, you can use the
Expand.exe program located on your Microsoft Windows NT compact disc to
copy the Arial font file to your hard disk. To do this:

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Microsoft Windows NT compact disc into a CD-ROM drive to
   which you have access. If the CD-ROM drive is on a network, map a drive
   letter to the CD-ROM drive so that you can access it from the command
   prompt.

<P><LI>On the Start menu, click Run. In the Open box, type "command" (without
   the quotation marks), and click OK.

<P><LI>At the command prompt, type the following command and press ENTER:
<P>
<P><PRE>      X:\I386\Expand X:\I386\Arial.tt_ C:\Winnt\Fonts\Arial.ttf
</PRE><P>
   This command assumes that your compact disc is in drive X, and that
   Windows NT is installed in the Winnt folder on your C drive.
<P>
   NOTE: You can use this command line to expand other fonts, if they are
   missing from your Fonts folder. Simply substitute the appropriate
   file name in the command.

<P><LI>After the font has been expanded, type "exit" (without the quotation
   marks), and press ENTER.
<P>
</OL>When you run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program, the fonts should
display correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program, you may notice a
series of "billboards" that appear in the upper-left corner of the screen.
These billboards are designed to inform you about new or enhanced features
in Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
Because the billboards are designed to display their text using the Arial
font, you may notice a display problem if the Arial font is not installed
on your computer. This problem does not affect the functionality of the
Setup program or any of the Microsoft Office 97 programs; however, since
the Arial font is commonly used in Microsoft Windows, you may want to
reinstall the Arial font if you notice a problem during Setup.
