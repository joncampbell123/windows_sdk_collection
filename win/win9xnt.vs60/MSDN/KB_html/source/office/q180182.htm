                              (driver linked against 10.03 client)

   Text                        ASCII text files


</PRE>Installing the DataDirect ODBC Drivers:
<P>
For information about installing the DataDirect ODBC Pack, refer to the
DataDirect ODBC Pack Installation Guide.
<P>
<P>
System Requirements for the Client:
<P>
The ODBC Pack for Power Macintosh requires:
<P>
<PRE>   System 7.1 or greater (System 8 is supported)
   8 MB memory
   6 MB of free space on the startup drive


</PRE>About ODBC Preferences:
<P>
We have included a sample ODBC Preferences file, which defines data sources
to enable you to use the ODBC drivers. If necessary, you can edit ODBC
Preferences using SimpleText.  We strongly suggest, however, that you use
the ODBC Setup Control Panel to configure and modify the data sources
defined in your ODBC Preferences file.
<P>
In the ODBC Preferences file, the ODBC Data Sources section describes the
available data sources.  The name to the left of the equal sign is the data
source name.  The name to the right of the equal sign is the driver name.
Each data source has a section that describes the options for that data
source.  You may change the data source name; however, if you do so, you
must change the section name for that data source to match the data source
name.  DO NOT CHANGE THE DRIVER NAME.  ODBC will not be able to find your
data source if the driver name is changed. Do not change the Driver entry
under each section.  Please refer to the INTERSOLV DataDirect ODBC Drivers
Reference for more information on configuring data sources.
<P>
<P>
About ODBC Demo:
<P>
ODBC Demo is a demonstration application that will make three attempts to
connect to a data source.  If unsuccessful, it will return an error
message.  The ODBC Demo folder contains source code and a Code Warrior 2.x
project that explains how to build an application using ODBC.
<P>
Notes and Known Problems:
<P>
The following are notes, known problems, or restrictions with version 3.01
of the DataDirect ODBC Pack for Power Macintosh.
<P>
These are the only known problems with this version.  If you find others,
please report them to INTERSOLV as soon as possible.
<P>
<P><h3>Text Driver Changes</h3>
 
<P>
Changes have been made to two of the tabs available when you are
configuring the Driver:
<P>
Advanced Tab--The "Return Additional Tables" pane has been removed to the
Mac File Types tab.
<P>
Mac File Types Tab--"Find tables by using" and "Return Additional Tables"
panes have been added to the Mac File Types tab.  Select one of the radio
buttons in the "Find tables by using" pane to specify whether to use
Macintosh file types or DOS file name extensions to locate tables.  If you
choose to "Return Additional Tables," you can do so either by matching file
types or file name extensions.  Your choice under the "Find tables by
using" pane determines which selection box is active in the "Return
Additional Tables" pane.  See the Text Driver chapter of the ODBC Drivers
Reference for complete information about returning additional tables.
<P>
<P><h3>ODBC Driver Manager</h3>
 
<P>
ODBC 3.0 drivers require the 3.0 version of the ODBC Driver Manager PPC.
Because the ODBC 3.0 Driver Manager is compatible with 2.x compliant
drivers, all 2.x versions of the Driver Manager should be removed from your
Extensions folder to ensure application stability.  Failing to remove older
versions of the Driver Manager may result in application errors and
abnormal terminations.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Office 4.2 Compatibility</h3>
 
<P>
Because Microsoft developed version 4.2 of Microsoft Office to use 680x0
ODBC even on the Power Macintosh, the ODBC Drivers are not currently
compatible.  The current ODBC Drivers are intended for Power Macintosh
processing only.  INTERSOLV is working to develop compatibility with the
forthcoming version of office
<P>
<P><h3>SQLColAttribute(s)</h3>
 
<P>
The column attributes 1001 and 1002, which were assigned as INTERSOLV
specific attributes, were inadvertently used as system attributes by the
Microsoft 3.0 ODBC implementation. Applications using those attributes
should now use 1901 and 1902 respectively.
<P>
<P><h3>SQL_C_NUMERIC</h3>
 
<P>
Because of inconsistencies in the ODBC specification, users attempting to
use SQL_C_NUMERIC parameters should set the precision and scale values of
the corresponding structure, and the descriptor fields in the APD.
<P>
<P><h3>For Text Users</h3>
 
<P>
Restriction:  When encountering an invalid file, you may receive too many
or duplicate errors from SQLError.
<P>
<P>

<P>
Before calling INTERSOLV Answerline, please collect basic information about
your system to help us understand the environment in which you are working
and the exact steps to reproduce the problem.
