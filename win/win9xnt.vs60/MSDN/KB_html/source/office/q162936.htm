<P>
The updated Setup files included with the Banfix.exe file correct
a problem that prevents you from installing Office 97 from a Banyan
Vines Server to a Windows NT workstation. Without this patch, Setup
fails and you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Bdrintl.dll was unable to register itself in the system registry.

</PRE></OL>To correct the problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create an admin image of Office 97 on the Banyan Vines server
   using the steps outlined in the Netwrk8.txt file in the
   Office folder of the Office 97 compact disc.

<P><LI>Replace the following three files
<P>
<P><PRE>      Acmsetup.exe
      Mssetup.dll
      Setup.exe
</PRE><P>
   with the files of the same name that are included in
   Banfix.exe. The files you should replace are located in the
   root of the Setup folder (named MSOffice by default) that was
   created during the admin image setup.

<P><LI>Continue the installation from the server as specified in the
   Netwrk8.txt file.
