<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to start an Office 98 Macintosh Edition program by
clicking the program menu command on the Microsoft Office Manager menu, you
may receive one of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not save changes, the Preferences file has been moved or
   deleted. Restart the computer to correct the problem.

   -or-

   Could not continue because a resource is missing.

</PRE>And the program that is associated with the menu command you clicked is not
started.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems occur if the Office Manager Preferences file is not present
in the System Folder:Preferences folder or if the file contains incomplete
information.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around these problems, restart your computer. After you restart the
computer, the menu commands on the Microsoft Office Manager menu work
correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Office Manager is included in the Microsoft Office 98
Macintosh Edition Value Pack. When you install the Microsoft Office Manager
control panel and restart your computer, the Microsoft Office Manager menu
appears to the left of the Application menu, which is in the upper-right
corner of the screen.
<P>
You can use the Microsoft Office Manager menu to start the programs
included with Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition and to switch between
running programs. You can also customize the menu by clicking Customize on
the Microsoft Office Manager menu.
