The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Office Professional for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform an administrative installation for any of the products
listed at the beginning of this article, if the Setup program was started
with a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) command similar to
<P>
<PRE>   \\servername\office95\setup.exe /a

</PRE>where \\servername\office95 is the UNC path that points to the Microsoft
Office 95 compact disc, you may receive any of the following error messages
<P>
<PRE>   Your setup files may be damaged.
   Try restarting the setup program.

</PRE>followed by:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Office 95 Setup was not completed successfully.

</PRE>CAUSE
 
<P>
These error messages may appear if the name of the server is longer than
eight characters.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving this error message, map a network drive to the shared
compact disc on the server and then run the Administrative Setup for
Microsoft Office version 7.0.
<P>
<P><h3>Example</h3>
 
<P>
If the name of the server is Myserver and the Microsoft Office 95 compact
disc is shared as Office95, map a drive letter, such as F, to
\\MYSERVER\OFFICE95. So, for example, if the F drive letter was mapped to
the above share, you would use the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   F:\setup.exe /a

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Office version 7.0 Setup program is designed to work with a
UNC command line only when performing a workstation installation to a local
machine from the server; it is not designed to perform the administrative
installation itself.
