The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Office Binder, when you open a Binder file located in a shared
folder, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The Binder file could not be loaded. The file is in use by another
   program.

</PRE>When you click OK, an empty Binder is displayed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you open a Binder in a shared folder if you have
read-only access rights to the folder instead of full rights to the folder.
If you have read-only access rights to the folder that contains the Binder,
you cannot open the file as read-only. Instead, when you open the file, you
receive the error message described above, and the file is not opened.
<P>
This behavior occurs whether the folder that contains the Binder is shared
using user-level access control or share-level access control.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To open a Binder in a shared folder, you must have full access to the
folder.
<P>
To work around this problem, you can copy the Binder from the shared folder
to a folder on your local hard disk, or to a folder that you have full
access to.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Office versions 7.0a and 7.0b for Windows 95.
