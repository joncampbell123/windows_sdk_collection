The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When associating a new file type with Microsoft Word, files of that type
open in Word 7.0 instead of opening in Word 97.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The problem above occurs if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You have associated the file type you are trying to open with
   Word.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>Both Word 7.0 and Word 97 are installed on the
   computer.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You are opening the file from the Windows Explorer.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will
post more information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Associating the file type with Microsoft Word 97 will cause the file to
open in the correct version of Microsoft Word. Follow the steps below to
re-associate the files.

<OL><P><LI>In the Windows Explorer, Click View on the menu and then click
   Options. The Options dialog will appear.

<P><LI>Click the File Types tab. Highlight the file type you are trying to
   open from the Registered Files Type list box. Click the Edit button.
   The Edit File Type dialog box will appear.

<P><LI>Highlight Open from the Actions list box. Click Edit. In the Editing
   Action For Type dialog box, click the Browse button. The Open With
   dialog box appears

<P><LI>Search for and highlight the Microsoft Office 97 executable file. That
   file in normally located in the C:\Program Files\Microsoft
   Office\Office folder. Click the Open and then click OK. Click Close
   twice.
<P>
</OL>When you now open that particular file type, it will open in Microsoft
Word 97 instead of Microsoft Word 7.0. This process must be repeated for
each new file type you wish to open into Microsoft Word 97.
