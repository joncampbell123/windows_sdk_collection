The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office Professional for Windows 95 and Bookshelf '95,
   version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Office 7.0 Professional and Bookshelf '95 are distributed on two
separate compact discs. It is possible to share these discs over a network
server to create an installation point for Office 7.0 Professional and to
provide a central location for Bookshelf '95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Disc 1</h3>
 
<P>
Disc 1 contains the Microsoft Office version 7.0 Program Files. You can
share Disc 1 as an installation point only on computers running any of the
following operating systems:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Windows NT version 3.51
   Microsoft Windows 95
   Novell Netware version 4.1

</PRE>The Office 7.0 Disc 1 contains various zero-byte files, which need
to be indexed by the CD-ROM driver on the network server. Because of the
design of an earlier version of Cdrom.nlm (Novell Netware CD-ROM driver)
this cannot be supported for Novell Netware version 3.x or Netware version
4.x.
<P>
<P><h3>Disc 2</h3>
 
<P>
Disc 2 contains the Bookshelf '95 Program Files. Disc 2 can be shared as a
resource on a network, as long as the server computer is running one of the
following operating systems:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Windows NT version 3.51
   Microsoft Windows 95
   Novell Netware version 4.1
   Novell Netware version 3.x and version 4.x

</PRE>It is possible to share the Bookshelf '95 compact disc on versions of
Novell Netware prior to version 4.1. If you do so, follow these
suggestions:

<UL><LI>Obtain the updated Cdrom.nlm from Novell. For instructions about how to
   obtain the newer version of the Cdrom.nlm, see the Network.txt file on
   the Office 7.0 Professional Compact Disc 1.

<LI>The Bookshelf '95 Compact Disc 2 contains various zero-byte files.
   Therefore, directly accessing program files on the compact disc may
   cause the server to crash. For this reason, Microsoft does not recommend
   that you share Disc 2 on Novell Netware, versions 3.x and 4.x.

<LI>The use of a shared Bookshelf '95 compact disc is supported only if you
   are using the Bookshelf '95 interface or the appropriate extensions
   provided with Microsoft Office 7.0 Professional.
<P>
</UL>Netware is manufactured by Novell, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
