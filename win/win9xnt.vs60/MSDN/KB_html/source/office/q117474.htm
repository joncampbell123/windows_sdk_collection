The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.2, 4.3
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office Setup program in maintenance mode, and
you choose the Remove All button, and you then choose the Cancel button to
interrupt the Setup program, the next time you run the Setup program, you
receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Could Not open the file named:
   C:\MSOFFICE\SETUP\SETUP.INF

</PRE>where C:\MSOFFICE is the directory to which you installed the Microsoft
Office files.
<P>
This also occurs when you select Add/Remove and an application such as
Microsoft Excel is removed. When you return to the Maintenance Mode of
Installation, you receive the error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Could Not open the file named:
   C:\MSOFFICE\SETUP\SETUP.INF

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message appears because the SETUP.INF file is one of the first
files that is removed when you choose to uninstall Microsoft Office. If you
cancel the Setup program while the Microsoft Office files are being
removed, the SETUP.INF file may have already been removed. You cannot run
the Microsoft Office Setup program if this file does not exist on your
computer.
<P>
The SETUP.INF file is the Setup Information file, and contains information
that the Setup program needs to run.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem and run the Microsoft Office Setup program again,
do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Restore the SETUP.INF file from the Microsoft Office Disk 1 using the
   following steps:
<P>
   1. Insert the Microsoft Office Disk 1 into your floppy disk drive.
<P>
   2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, change to the drive that contains the
<P><PRE>      disk.
</PRE><P>
   3. Type the following and press ENTER
<P>
<PRE>         decomp setup.in_ c:\msoffice\setup\setup.inf

      where c:\msoffice is the directory to which you installed Microsoft
      Office.

   4. Run the Microsoft Office Setup program again.

   5. To repeat the last installation and restore any files and settings
      that were accidentally removed, choose the Reinstall button.

   -or-

</PRE><LI>Rename the SETUP.STF file using the following steps:
<P>
   1. Using File Manager, rename the SETUP.STF file in the SETUP
<P><PRE>      subdirectory of your Microsoft Office directory.
</PRE><P>
   2. Run the Microsoft Office Setup program again.
<P>
   3. Choose the installation option that you chose when you installed
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Office.
</PRE><P>
</UL>The Setup program should run quickly when you use this procedure, because
the files already exist on your hard drive, so the Setup program does not
have to copy them again.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
