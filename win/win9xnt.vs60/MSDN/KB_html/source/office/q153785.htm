The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Typing very quickly and accurately for varying lengths of time may cause
Microsoft Word to stop responding. The only way to recover from this is to
press CTRL+ALT+DELETE, to select the application that is not responding,
and then to click the End Task button.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem typically occurs when the following are true:

<UL><LI>You have one or more Auto features turned on.
<LI>You are a very fast and accurate typist.
<LI>You are typing quickly without typing a BACKSPACE, TAB, RETURN, or
   DELETE key.
<P>
</UL>In this case, Word does not have the chance to engage any of the
automatic features. This problem does not occur when Word has the chance
to activate any of the automatic features or when you type any of the keys
mentioned above.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: Because it is very rare that this situation occurs, other
troubleshooting steps should not be ruled out to resolve or work around
this problem.
<P>
To work around this problem, disable all of the Auto features. To do so,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the AutoFormat tab.

<P><LI>Under Show Options For, select AutoFormat As You Type.

<P><LI>Under Apply As You Type, click to clear all check boxes.

<P><LI>Under Replace As You Type, click to clear all check boxes.

<P><LI>Click the Edit tab.

<P><LI>Click to clear the "Use Tab and Backspace Keys to set Left Indent"
    check box.

<P><LI>Click the General tab.

<P><LI>Click to clear the TipWizard Active check box.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Autocorrect.

<P><LI>Click to clear all check boxes, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If all Auto features are not turned off (that is to say, if only some
features are turned off), this problem may actually manifest itself sooner
and increase in severity.
