The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The "More Cool Stuff" template that is included in Microsoft Office 97 for
Windows states that the Personal Web Server for Windows is included in the
Microsoft Office 97 Value Pack. This information is incorrect.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Although the Personal Web Server for Windows is not included in the Value
Pack, you can download it from the Microsoft Web site. To do this, use your
Web browser to go to the following address:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/download/">http://www.microsoft.com/ie/download/</A></B>

</PRE>The link to download the Personal Web Server is located near the bottom of
the page.
<P>
NOTE: Because the Microsoft Web site is constantly updated, the site
address may change without notice. If this occurs, link to the Microsoft
home page at the following address:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/">http://www.microsoft.com/</A></B>


</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To view the incorrect information, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, click New Office Document.

<P><LI>Click the Web Pages tab. Click More Cool Stuff, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL>The More Cool Stuff template is opened in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows. It
contains the following text:
<P>
<PRE>   More Cool Stuff

   Microsoft Word provides additional Web related tools and documents. You
   can download free additional Web Page Wizard content documents and
   visual styles from the Microsoft Word Web Site.

   You may also find the following files useful. If you installed
   Microsoft Word from a CD, insert the disk, open the ValuPack folder and
   double click on the appropriate file.

   AXPlugin   A plugin for Netscape that makes it possible to open
              Microsoft Office documents inside a Netscape browser.

   WebPost    A wizard that takes you through the steps of posting a
              document to the Web.

   PwebSrv    A program that runs a web server on your Windows 95 machine
              or Windows NT Workstation.

   IExplore   Internet Explorer 3.0

</PRE></OL>The PwebSrv file is not included in the ValuPack folder. The other three
files (AXPlugin, WebPost, and IExplore) are included in the Value Pack.
