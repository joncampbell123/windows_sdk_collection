RELEASE NOTES FOR MICROSOFT SMALL BUSINESS PACK
FOR MICROSOFT OFFICE 95
<P>
 
<P>
This document contains information that supplements the
Small Business Pack online documentation. If you open this
document in Notepad, most of the text will print with
correct line breaks if you first set both the left and
right margins to 0.75 inch or smaller.

  5. Printing Charts

</PRE> 

<OL><P><LI>BEFORE USING THE BUSINESS DATABASE
</OL> 
<P>
EXITING YOUR DATABASE: Always exit the database by choosing
the Exit button on the Business Database toolbar. If you
choose Exit from the File menu or use the Control-menu
box, the Business Database may not update your last
transaction.
<P>
OPENING AND PRINTING FORMS IN YOUR DATABASE: Always open
the Small Business Pack forms and reports from either the
Small Business Pack toolbar or the Small Business Pack
Help. Opening multiple forms from the Forms window
in Access can deplete system resources, resulting in
degraded performance or errors.
<P>
Before printing forms or reports, complete all fields on
the form; otherwise, what you've printed may not
match the state of the database.
<P>

<OL><P><LI>PRINTING LARGER DOCUMENTS TO POSTSCRIPT PRINTERS
</OL> 
<P>
The Small Business Pack Business Plan requires substantial
PostScript printer memory (more than 1 MB) to print
completely. If you try to print but your printer has too
little memory, the print job may fail unpredictably---
usually with a PostScript error after a few pages print
successfully. To avoid this failure, try printing a few
pages at a time.
<P>
The entire document will print correctly to a PCL-compatible
printer. If a PCL printer is available, print to it. If you
must print to a PostScript printer, try using a generic
PostScript printer driver (e.g., PSCRIPT.DRV) provided with
your Windows system.
<P>
You can verify the memory actually available in your printer
at least two ways:
--Choose the Device Options tab in the Properties dialog
<PRE>  box for your printer
</PRE></OL>--Print a printer test page, which may include this
<PRE>  information. For instructions, refer to the manufacturer's
  manual.

</PRE><P><LI>VIEWING AND PRINTING TAB LEADERS
</OL> 
<P>
If your document contains tab leaders, they may display
and print in slightly different locations. If this happens
with your document, you should switch to spaces for tab
leaders before printing.

<OL><P><LI>VIEWING CELL NOTES IN WORKBOOKS
</OL> 
<P>
To view cell notes in Excel workbooks, choose Options on
the Tools menu, and make sure you have chosen the Note
Indicator on the View tab.

<OL><P><LI>PRINTING CHARTS
</OL> 
<P>
Some charts may display properly, yet print incorrectly.
For example, a chart may print to two pages, instead of
the expected one page. If this happens with your printer,
you should adjust the scaling factor in Page Setup before
printing.

<OL><P><LI>AUTOMATIC CALCULATION
</OL> 
<P>
Some of the Small Business Pack Excel templates calculate
totals automatically. To ensure this calculation is
performed correctly, choose Options from the Tools menu,
and select Automatic on the Calculation tab.

<OL><P><LI>BUSINESS ANALYZER, MICROSOFT MAIL, AND MICROSOFT WORD
</OL> 
<P>
If you want to see the Narrative Report, you should first
close all mail messages that have been opened by Microsoft
Word, if any.  Then, press the Narrative Report button.

<OL><P><LI>RUNNING UNDER THE NT OPERATING SYSTEM
</OL> 
<P>
The contents of the Small Business Pack are fully
functional. You may use all templates and databases with
the Office applications, and learn about them and their
associated educational content with the Help system.
However, access to the product's features from the
Office shortcut bar will not be complete. Also, you will
not be able to run applications from within Help.
<P>
The following table locates the product's features.
To use a feature, use either the "Start a New Document"
or "Open a Document" Office feature, then find the
document you want in its location described below.
Note: if you installed Office to a directory other than
Msoffice, you will need to substitute the correct name.

</PRE><P><LI>PARTITIONED AND MULTIPLE HARD DRIVES
</OL> 
<P>
The Office Small Business Pack will not support partitioned
drives or systems with multiple hard drives.  Here is a
summary of conditions and suggestions:
<P>
I. If you have installed Office 95 on Drive C: and Small
<PRE>   Business Pack on Drive D:

   When you attempt to launch any of the Word, Excel or
   PowerPoint templates, you may receive an error,
   "Cannot Find or Run the file or program
   \mydocu~1\&lt;folder name&gt;\&lt;filename&gt;". The path is always
   displayed in 8.3 file format.

      WORKAROUNDS
      ===========

      1) Access the templates through the following Small
         Business Pack folder shortcuts on the Office Shortcut bar:

         Financial
         Management
         Marketing
         Operations
         Planning
         Sales

      2) Launch one of the Access databases from the help file
         in the following help path from the Small Business Pack
         toolbar:

         a) Click on the Small Business Pack Help button on the
            Small Business Pack toolbar
         b) Choose the Answer Wizard tab and type in "Job Listings"
            without the quotes.
         c) Choose the "Search" button and then select "Job Listings"
            from the help topics list.
         d) Choose the "To Open the Job Listings form now, click
            &lt;button&gt;" in this help screen.
         e) Once the database launches and asks the user to Attach
            a database, choose Close to close the database.
         f) Now the template links should work. For example, if
            you choose the Small Business Pack Help button, Contents
            tab, choose "Using the Documents", choose Financial,
            choose Accounts Payable, then choose the link button at
            the bottom, the link should now work.

</PRE></OL>II. If you have installed both Office 95 and Small Business Pack on
<PRE>    Drive D:

    You will not immediately get the error, "Cannot Find or Run the
    file or program \mydocu~1\&lt;folder name&gt;\&lt;filename&gt;" when
    attempting to open the templates via the links in the help file.
    However, you will eventually run into this error message and then
    none of the help links to the Word, Excel or PowerPoint templates
    will work. The Access links will work but you will need to
    reinstall the Small Business Pack to get the links to work again for
    the templates.

       WORKAROUNDS
       ===========

       1) Access the templates through the following Small
          Business Pack folder shortcuts on the Office Shortcut bar:

             Financial
             Management
             Marketing
             Operations
             Planning
             Sales

       2) Start the Small Business Pack setup and choose the
          "Remove All" option to remove the Small Business Pack.
          Then, restart setup and reinstall. However, this may not
          permanently remove the problem and it may appear again later.
          See Workaround (1) above.

</PRE>III. If you have installed Office 95 on Drive D: and Small
<PRE>     Business Pack on Drive C:

     When you attempt to launch any of the Word, Excel or
     PowerPoint templates from the help file or Answer Wizard,
     you will get an error, "Cannot Find or Run the file or
     program /mydocu~1/&lt;folder name&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;".  The path is
     always displayed in 8.3 file format. For example, you may see
     an error message like this:

     "Cannot find or run the file or program
     /mydocu~1/financ~1/accoun~1.lnk"

     WORKAROUND
     ==========

     Start the Small Business Pack setup and choose the "Remove All"
     option to remove the Small Business Pack. Then, restart setup
     and reinstall. However, this may not permanently remove the problem
     and it may appear again later. See Workaround II, (1) above.
