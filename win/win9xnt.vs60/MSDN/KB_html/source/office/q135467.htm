The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Project for Windows 95, version 4.1
<LI>Microsoft Access, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Send and Add Routing Slip commands in Microsoft Office programs may
no longer appear on the File menu after you remove Microsoft Project.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if cc:Mail or Lotus Notes is installed on your computer
and you remove the Microsoft Project program after installing one of the
Microsoft Office programs.
<P>
This problem only occurs if you install Microsoft Project before you
install the Office program. For example, if you install Microsoft Word
before you install Microsoft Project, this problem does not occur when you
remove Microsoft Project.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To add the Send and Add Routing Slip commands to the File menu in the
Office program, use either of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Remove and Reinstall the Program</h3>
 
<P>
To remove and reinstall the program, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Run the Setup program for the Office program in maintenance mode.
   Click the Remove All button.

<P><LI>Run Setup for the Office program again. Click the installation option
   that you want and select any specific components that you want to
   install (Custom installation only) and finish running Setup.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Add the Appropriate Registry Key</h3>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
before you edit the registry.
<P>
You can also resolve this issue by adding the appropriate registry entry to
the Windows registry. To do this, add the following registry key
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Office\95\MAPIDLL

</PRE></OL>and then add the following String Values:
<P>
<PRE>   Value Name: DLL32
   Value Data: &lt;C:\Windows&gt;\System\Mapivi32.dll

</PRE>Note that &lt;c:\Windows&gt; is the folder in which you installed Microsoft
Windows. Do NOT type the brackets when you add the value.
<P>
This method works because only the registry entry is removed when you
remove Microsoft Project; the Mapivi32.dll file is not removed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If cc:Mail or Lotus Notes is installed on your computer when you run the
Setup program for any of the Office programs listed at the beginning of
this article, the Mapivi32.dll file is installed and registered in Windows
so that you can use the Send or Add Routing Slip commands in the program.
However, when you install an Office program after installing Microsoft
Project, the Office program detects that the Mapivi32.dll file is already
installed and registered on your computer (cc:Mail or Lotus Notes is
installed) and does not register Mapivi32.dll in the Windows registry. If
you then remove Microsoft Project, the Microsoft Project Setup program
removes the registry entry for the Mapivi32.dll file; therefore, the Send
and Add Routing Slip commands are no longer available in the Office
program.
