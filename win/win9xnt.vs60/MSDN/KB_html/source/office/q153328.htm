SUMMARY
 
<P>
Before installing Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0b on a
computer that already has Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0 or
7.0a installed, you do not have to remove the currently installed version.
However, it is important to install the maintenance release of Office
version 7.0b into the same folder where Office was previously installed, to
choose the same type of installation as before, and to install the same, or
more, components if a Custom installation was originally performed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Office for Windows 95 version 7.0b is a maintenance release of
Microsoft Office for Windows 95 versions 7.0 and 7.0a. Although the file,
Offreadme.txt, exists on the first Microsoft Office for Windows 95 disk and
on the root of the Microsoft Office for Windows 95 compact disc to assist
you in upgrading Microsoft Office for Windows 95, there are no instructions
sent with the release or in the Offreadme.txt file to guide you in
"upgrading" the existing Microsoft Office for Windows 95 version 7.0 or
7.0a installation. It is not necessary (and it is not suggested) that you
remove the previous version of Microsoft Office for Windows 95 because
customizations for the products may be lost. Below are some instructions
for upgrading in different, existing installation scenarios.
<P>
NOTE: If you want to change the installation type or installation
destination folder, you must run setup from the previous Microsoft Office
for Windows 95 media and choose Remove All from maintenance mode setup
before installing Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0b.
<P>
<P><h3>For An Existing Administrative Installation</h3>
 
<P>
Delete the current administrative installation and follow the same
directions to perform another administrative installation of Office to the
same network share. See the Network.txt file on the first Microsoft Office
for Windows 95 disk or on the root of the Microsoft Office for Windows 95
compact disc for additional instructions. Please note that each "Run from
Network Server" installation must also be performed again (see below).
<P>
<P><h3>For an Existing Run from Network Server Installation</h3>
 
<P>
Each "Run from Network Server" installation must be performed again after
the administrative installation has been updated. The destination folder
must be the same. See the Network.txt file for additional instructions.
<P>
<P><h3>For an Existing Custom Installation</h3>
 
<P>
Perform another Custom installation. The destination folder must be the
same and the same items (or more) in the options list must be selected in
order to update older files.
<P>
NOTE: If you do not recall which components you previously installed, you
must either install every component of Microsoft Office for Windows 95,
version 7.0b, or you must run setup from the previous Microsoft Office for
Windows 95 media and choose Remove All from maintenance mode setup, and
then install Microsoft Office for Windows 95 version 7.0b into the same
folder.
<P>
<P><h3>For an Existing Compact, Typical, Run from CD Installation</h3>
 
<P>
Perform another installation of the same type with the maintenance release.
The destination folder must also be the same.
