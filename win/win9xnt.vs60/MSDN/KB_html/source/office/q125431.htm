The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, version 4.2

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install one of the applications listed above, one of the
following symptoms may occur:
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Excel, when you choose Examples And Demos or Quick Preview
from the Help menu, a dialog box appears with the message "Cannot find
Examples And Demos" or "Cannot find Quick Preview," and you are requested
to select the file from a folder on your hard disk drive.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Word</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Word, when you choose Examples And Demos or Quick Preview from
the Help menu, a dialog box appears with the message "Please locate
Examples and Demos" or "Please locate Quick Preview," and a list of
folders on you hard drive is displayed. If you choose Cancel, one of the
following error messages appears:

<UL><LI>Word cannot start Examples and Demos
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Word cannot start the Quick Preview
<P>
</UL><h3>PowerPoint</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft PowerPoint, when you choose Quick Preview from the Help menu,
you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   PowerPoint could not locate or start the Quick Preview. You may not have
   enough memory, or you may need to install it using PowerPoint Setup.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if you perform a Typical or Minimum installation of
Microsoft Office, or of one of the Microsoft Office applications.
<P>
Examples And Demos is included with Microsoft Excel and Word as part of the
Help system. Quick Preview is included with Microsoft Excel, Word, and
PowerPoint. However, neither Quick Preview nor Examples And Demos is
installed if you choose the Typical or Minimum installation options.
<P>
Note that the Examples And Demos command (in Microsoft Excel and Word) and
the Quick Preview command are available on the Help menu, even if the
corresponding files are not installed.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To install Examples And Demos or Quick Preview after you have installed
Microsoft Office or one of the Microsoft Office applications, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>Run the Microsoft Office or Microsoft Office application Setup
   program again in maintenance mode.

<P><LI>In the Components Not Yet Installed list, click the arrow next to
   Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word or Microsoft PowerPoint to display
   the installation options.

<P><LI>Clear any items that you do NOT want to install. Click the arrow next
   to Online Help and Lessons (Microsoft Excel), Online Help (Microsoft
   Word) or Help, Quick Preview and... (Microsoft PowerPoint)

<P><LI>Clear any items that you do NOT want to install. Make sure that the
   appropriate Quick Preview or Examples And Demos item is selected.
<P>
   Note that when you select Examples and Demos under Microsoft Word,
   Quick Preview is also installed. There is no separate Quick Preview
   option when you install Microsoft Word.

<P><LI>Choose Continue.
