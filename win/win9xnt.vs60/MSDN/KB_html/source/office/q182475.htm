IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry  Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you click Open or Save on the File menu for any of the programs listed
at the beginning of this article and click the Look In list, you may
receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, you may receive an error message similar to the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;Program&gt; caused an invalid page fault in module KERNEL32.DLL at
   0137:BFF9A5D0.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems may occur if an invalid File Transfer Protocol (FTP) site is
included in the Look In list.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem remove the invalid FTP site from the list. To
do this, you must edit the Windows registry.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
If you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency
Repair Disk (ERD).
<P>
NOTE: Because there are several versions of Windows, the following steps
may be different on your computer. If they are, please consult your product
documentation to complete these steps.
<P>
To remove the FTP site, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Quit all running programs.

<P><LI>Click the Windows Start button, and then click Run.

<P><LI>In the Open box, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks), and
   then click OK.

<P><LI>Go to the following Registry key:
<P>
<P><PRE>     HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Common\Internet
     \FTP Sites
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The Status bar displays the following:
<P>
<PRE>         My Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office
         \8.0\Common\Internet\FTP Sites

</PRE><P><LI>Select the FTP Sites folder, go to the Registry menu and click Export
   Registry File, provide a name for the export file and save it to the
   desktop.
<P>
   NOTE: This step creates a backup of the key so that you can restore the
   key if necessary. To restore the key, double-click the file after you
   complete these steps. You can delete this file from the desktop after
   you are satisfied that the issue is resolved (after you complete these
   steps).
<P>
   Any folders that exist within the FTP Sites folder are the site
   addresses, (for example the first folder is labeled Site_0).

<P><LI>Delete these folders by selecting the folder and clicking Delete on the
   Edit menu. Click Yes if you are prompted to confirm the deletion.

<P><LI>Close the Registry Editor.
