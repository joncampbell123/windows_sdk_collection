<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program, you receive the error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   One or more of the setup files are missing, setup could not continue.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error may be caused when you attempt to install Microsoft Office 97 on
a removable media drive that is configured as removable.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, obtain the latest version of the software
utility for your drive and/or configure the drive as a nonremovable drive.
<P>
<P><h3>Software Drive Utilities</h3>
 
<P>
Ensure you have the latest version of the utility program that is available
for your drive. In some cases, using the updated version corrects the
problem. Contact the drive manufacturer for information about updates.
<P>
For information about how to contact the manufacturer, query in the
Knowledge Base for one of the following articles:

   TITLE     : Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, Q-Z

</PRE><h3>Configure Drive as Nonremovable</h3>
 
<P>
Many removable drives come with a utility program that allows you to
configure the drive as removable or nonremovable. Run the utility and
configure the drive as nonremovable. For more information about running the
utility or configuring the drive, contact the drive manufacturer.
<P>
Note that some removable drives (usually external drives) have a switch on
the drive that changes the drive configuration from removable to
nonremovable. If the switch is available, use it instead of a software
utility to make the change. For more information about configuring your
drive, contact your drive manufacturer.
<P>
If you are using an Iomega Jaz removable drive, you should use the drive
utilities included with the Jaz drive. Do not use the Windows Device
Manager or, if you have a SCSI Jaz drive, the SCSI adapter's utilities to
make the Jaz drive nonremovable.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Some of the latest drive utilities allow you to configure the removable
media drive as removable and successfully install Microsoft Office 97. If
the utility does not support this, you must configure the removable media
drive as nonremovable if you want to use it as the boot drive or if you
want to install Microsoft Office 97 on it.
