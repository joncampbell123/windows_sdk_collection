<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Microsoft Office 97 Setup, you receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup Error 168:
   Setup has encountered a problem updating your system registry.

</PRE>When you try to open any Microsoft Office 97 program, you receive the
following error message
<P>
<PRE>   The Tahoma font is not present. For best results, please exit
   &lt;application&gt; and run the setup program.

</PRE>where &lt;application&gt; is the program you try to open. The error message may
vary slightly based on which program you try to start.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Office 97 Setup installs the Tahoma font. If the Setup program is
unable to install this font, you may encounter either or both of the error
messages listed in the "Symptoms" section of this article. You may receive
these errors if the font was not installed during setup or if you manually
removed the Tahoma font after the Setup program is finished.
<P>
<P><h3>Error Message 1</h3>
 
<P>
Setup Error 168:
Setup has encountered a problem updating your system registry.
<P>
The Microsoft Office 97 Setup program is unable to update the registry if
you installed the maximum number of TrueType fonts (approximately 1,000) on
your system prior to running the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program.
<P>
<P><h3>Error Message 2</h3>
 
<P>
The Tahoma font is not present. For best results, please exit
&lt;application&gt; and run the setup program.
<P>
This error message is displayed because the program cannot find the Tahoma
font. You may receive this error message even after the Microsoft Office 97
Setup program has completed successfully. The program does not find the
Tahoma font if you have manually removed the font from your system.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve the problem, use one of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Run Setup and Reinstall</h3>
 
<P>
If you manually removed the Tahoma font from your system after Office 97
Setup completed successfully, run the Office 97 Setup program and click
Reinstall. If this does not resolve the problem, follow the steps for
Method 2.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Manually Install the Font</h3>
 
<P>
If you did not remove the Tahoma font and you have not exceeded the
Microsoft Windows 95 TrueType font limit (approximately 1,000) on your
computer, you can manually install the font by following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Place the Microsoft Office 97 compact disc in the CD-ROM drive.

<P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the Fonts shortcut folder.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Install New Font to open the Add Fonts dialog
   box.

<P><LI>In the Drives list, click the CD-ROM drive.

<P><LI>In the Folders list, double-click the OS folder.

<P><LI>In the OS folder, double-click the Fonts folder.

<P><LI>Locate the Tahoma font and click to select it. Press and hold the
   CONTROL key, and then click the Tahoma Bold font to select both fonts.
   Click OK.

<P><LI>Close all open windows and reboot your system.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 3: Delete Fonts from the System</h3>
 
<P>
If you have exceeded the limit in Microsoft Windows 95 for TrueType fonts
(approximately 1,000) on your computer, you can delete fonts from your
system to reduce the number below 1,000, and then run the Office 97 Setup
program again. To do this, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click the Fonts shortcut folder.

<P><LI>With the Fonts folder open, click the fonts you want to remove, and
   drag them to your Recycle Bin.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE><P>
   Click the fonts you want to remove and press DELETE. When you are
   prompted to confirm the deletion of the file, click OK.

<P><LI>The number of fonts you need to remove will vary. There is an
   approximate limit of 1,000 TrueType fonts that can be installed on
   Windows 95; however, the actual number will vary. If the font names
   are long, you cannot have as many fonts installed. For example,
   "Bookman Old Style Bold Italic" is 29 characters long. "Arial" is 5
   characters long. You should have fewer TrueType fonts installed on your
   system if the font names are long.

<P><LI>After removing the fonts, restart your system.

<P><LI>Run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program and click Reinstall.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program, there is no separate option to
install the Tahoma font. In most cases, Setup installs it automatically.
<P>
<P><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
