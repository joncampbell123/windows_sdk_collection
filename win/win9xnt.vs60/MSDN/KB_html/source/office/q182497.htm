</PRE>ROLLING OUT OFFICE 98 FOR THE MACINTOSH
<P>
If you manage a few dozen to a few thousand Macintosh computers, you will
appreciate the installation and management options available in Microsoft
Office 98 for the Macintosh. Enterprise deployment options include both an
installer program and drag-and-drop installation. Office is highly
resilient; it can replace missing files and fix other problems without user
intervention. This document describes enterprise deployment strategies for
Office.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Office</h3>
 
<P>
Office supports two distinct installation strategies:

<UL><LI>Run the Microsoft Office Installer program.
<P>
</UL>Microsoft Office Installer supports two options: Easy Install and Custom
Install.
<P>
<PRE>   This installation       Contains
   option
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   Easy Install            The Excel, PowerPoint, and Word components
                           most Office users are likely to use
                           regularly.
   Custom Install          Whatever Office components you select, except
                           for Value Pack components and the Outlook
                           Express e-mail program.

</PRE>Microsoft Office Installer also includes a Remove option, which uninstalls
Office 98. For more information, see "Uninstalling Office 98" later in this
document.

<UL><LI>Use the Drag-and-drop method to copy the Microsoft Office 98 folder
   from the Office CD or a network drive to a hard disk.
<P>
</UL>Drag-and-drop refers to literally dragging the Microsoft Office 98 folder
from the Office CD or a network drive to a hard disk. You can use the drag-
and-drop method to copy either the folder that corresponds to an Easy
installation, or the folder that corresponds to a Complete installation.
<P>
<PRE>   Drag this folder                                    For this type of
                                                       installation
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Microsoft Office 98                                 Easy
   at the root of the Office CD
   Office Custom Install:Microsoft Office 98           Complete

</PRE>Drag-and-drop installation requires one additional step to complete the
Office installation. The first time any Office application is run, Office
copies several required files into the System Folder on the local hard
disk. This process is referred to as First Run Installation. First Run
Installation may take several minutes to complete, but after it is finished
it is not normally required again and thereafter Office applications start
more quickly.
<P>
One benefit of First Run Installation is that if Office detects that any
required files are missing from the local System Folder, it copies them
from the Microsoft Office 98 folder. This gives Office a high level of
resiliency; if the user inadvertently removes required Office files from
the System Folder, Office replaces the missing files the next time an
Office application is started.
<P>
First Run Installation also allows Office 98 to resume working in the event
a user performs a Clean System Install when upgrading to a new release of
the Mac OS. Other changes to a hard disk, such as changing its name, do not
prevent Office from recovering. Moving the entire Microsoft Office 98
folder around on a hard disk likewise does not affect Office. However, you
should not alter the folder structure within the Microsoft Office 98
folder.
<P>
Office can be installed on a client computer using either of these media:

<UL><LI>Office CD
   This media choice requires a CD-ROM drive, and it requires the
   installer to be physically present at the client computer.

<LI>Network
   Installing from a network server simplifies the distribution of Office
   to users. However, it requires a network connection during
   installation and, if you share Office files over the network,
   continuous network access while Office is running on the client
   computer.
<P>
</UL><h3>Running Office from the Office CD or a Network</h3>
 
<P>
Office 98 can be run directly from the Office CD or from a network drive,
but with lesser performance than when run locally. When running an Office
application from the Office CD or a network drive, the system must preload
the application and all shared libraries from the CD or network drive into
memory before it can run. What this means for the user is that the
application starts very slowly. However, once the application is running,
it should perform normally.
<P>
When an Office 98 application is initially run directly from the Office CD
or from a network drive, First Run Installation copies Office system files
to the System Folder, and creates Preference files in the System
Folder:Preferences folder. After that's completed, the application starts
normally. When the application is subsequently run, First Run Installation
is not repeated so start-up time improves.
<P>
<P><h3>Customizing Client Installations</h3>
 
<P>
The following strategy is recommended for creating customized client
installations:
<P>
Use the Custom Install option in Microsoft Office Installer to create a
custom Office installation point on a network drive. Choose the
applications and options you want in Microsoft Office Installer.
<P>
(Optional) Copy the file Microsoft Office 98 from the Office CD to clear
the user and organization name on the network installation point.
Further customize this installation with your own templates, Value Pack
components, and so on as needed.
Drag the Microsoft Office 98 folder from the network drive onto local hard
disks.
<P>
(Optional) Start an Office application on the local hard disk to complete
the First Run Installation process.
<P>
The following sections describe each of these steps in more detail.
<P>
<P><h3>Create an Office Network Installation Point</h3>
 
<P>
Creating a network installation point requires a Macintosh file server,
Windows NT Server, or other type of server properly configured to work with
Macintosh client computers.
<P>
To create a network installation point for Office

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Office CD into the appropriate drive.

<P><LI>Open the Office Custom Install folder.

<P><LI>Double-click Microsoft Office Installer.

<P><LI>Select Custom Install.

<P><LI>Choose the specific Office components you want installed.

<P><LI>In the Install Location list, select the network drive at the root
   of which you want to create the customized network installation point.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE><P>
   In the Install Location list, select Select folder and then select
   the specific folder in which you want to create the customized
   network installation point, and then click Select.

<P><LI>Click Install.

<P><LI>Enter the name and organization you want used in all subsequent
   installations of Office created from this network installation point.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE><P>
   Enter any values you want now; later, you can undo this action so
   that during subsequent installations of Office from this network
  installation point the user is prompted for this information.

<P><LI>Enter and confirm your 10 digit CD key.
<P>
</OL>Microsoft Office Installer then installs the Office components you selected
onto the network drive you specified.
<P>
If you want to, you can clear the user name and organization information
you entered previously for your network installation point. When Office is
later installed onto client computers, Office prompts for this information.
Skip this step if you do not want users prompted again during Office
deployment.
<P>
To clear user name and organization information
<P>
Insert the Microsoft Office CD into the appropriate drive.
On the Office CD, open the folder Microsoft Office 98:Office and copy the
file Microsoft Office 98 to the folder Microsoft Office 98:Office on the
network drive.
<P>
<P><h3>Customizing the Office Network Installation Point</h3>
 
<P>
You can add your own custom components to the Microsoft Office 98 folder on
the network drive. For example, you can add Value Pack components, custom
templates, and startup documents.
<P>
To customize the Office network installation point
<P>
On the network drive, open the Microsoft Office 98 folder.
Customize Office as needed. Some options include:
<P>
<PRE>   To                             Do this
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   Add custom templates to        Copy your custom templates for Excel,
   Office                         PowerPoint, or Word to one of the
                                  folders in the Microsoft
                                  Office 98:Templates folder.
   Open a document each time      Copy the document to the Excel,
   its related application        PowerPoint, or Word folder in the
   is started                     Microsoft Office 98:Office:Startup
                                  folder.
   Add a custom add-in to         Copy your custom add-in to the
   Excel                          Microsoft Office 98:Office:Excel
                                  Add-ins folder.
   Add an Office Value Pack       In most cases, you can drag the
   component to Office            Value Pack component directly from the
                                  Value Pack folder to the network
                                  installation point. Some Value Pack
                                  components must be copied into the
                                  System Folder on the local hard disk.
                                  For more information, see "Installing
                                  Value Pack Components" later in this
                                  document.

</PRE></OL>These are just a few of the ways you can customize an Office network
installation point. After you have finished customizing it, you are ready
to roll out Office to the client computers in your organization.
<P>
<P><h3>Rolling Out Office to Client Computers</h3>
 
<P>
Depending on your network environment and administration tools, there are
several strategies you can use to roll out Office to the client computers
in your organization:

<UL><LI>Push the Microsoft Office 98 folder to client computers by dragging
   the folder to each hard disk from a network server. This requires that
   you have read-write access to the client computer, and File Sharing on
   each client computer is properly enabled.

<LI>Pull the Microsoft Office 98 folder to client computers by dragging
   the Microsoft Office 98 folder from the network installation point.
   This requires that you or the end users initiate the drag-and-drop
   installation from each client computer.

<LI>Install the Microsoft Office 98 folder to client computers by using a
   third party Macintosh network management program. For example, many
   such programs can copy a script to the System Folder:Startup Items
   folder on a client computer. The script then copies the Microsoft
   Office 98 folder from the network installation point to the hard disk.
<P>
</UL>Depending on the rollout method you use, you may also want to incorporate
First Run Installation into your rollout. This saves end users from
spending time waiting for First Run Installation to complete, and may avoid
calls to your organization's help desk about slow startup.
<P>
<P><h3>Uninstalling Office 98</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Office Installer can remove Office 98 from a local or network
drive, regardless of how Office was initially installed on that drive.
<P>
To uninstall Office 98

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Microsoft Office CD into the appropriate drive.

<P><LI>Open the Office Custom Install Folder.

<P><LI>Double-click Microsoft Office Installer.

<P><LI>Select Remove.

<P><LI>In the Install Location list, select the local or network drive that
   contains the Office installation you want removed.

<P><LI>Click Remove.
<P>
</OL>Microsoft Office Installer does not remove files from the System Folder on
the local hard disk, because Microsoft Office Installer cannot determine if
such files may be used by other applications. In addition, Microsoft Office
Installer does not remove any Value Pack components or other files in the
Microsoft Office 98 folder that were not put there by the initial Office
installation.
<P>
Note: Rather than running Microsoft Office Installer to remove Office, you
can delete the Microsoft Office 98 folder by dragging it to the Trash.
However, by doing so you also delete any Value Pack components or other
files (including data files) stored in the Microsoft Office 98 folder.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Remove Office 98</h3>
 
<P>
Remove Office 98 helps you find and remove pre-release and current versions
of Office 98 that you no longer need on your computer. Unlike the Remove
option in the Microsoft Office Installer, Remove Office 98 will completely
clean your drive of all system extensions, control panels, shared
libraries, and preferences from a previous installation. In addition, you
are provided with the option of deleting OLE and Internet shared
preferences and then removing all copies of the Microsoft Office 98 folder
that may have been installed to that drive. When completed, you should be
ready to reinstall the latest releases of your Microsoft applications to
that drive.
<P>
Remove Office 98  will only completely remove components installed with the
Microsoft Office Installer that came with the following programs:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 98 (including all Early Test releases and Betas)
<LI>Microsoft Word 98
<LI>Microsoft Excel 98
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 98
<P>
</UL>To start the Remove Office 98 application

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Microsoft Office CD into the appropriate drive.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE><P>
   If you copied the Value Pack folder to a network drive, connect to
   that drive.

<P><LI>Open the Value Pack:Administration Tools folder.

<P><LI>Double-click Remove Office 98.

<P><LI>In the pop-up menu, select the drive that contains the copies of
   Microsoft Office 98 that you want removed.

<P><LI>Click the Remove button.

<P><LI>When prompted to remove shared OLE and Internet preferences, select Keep
   or Discard.
<P>
   Warning: Deleting these files may cause other OLE and Internet
   applications to stop working. Choose Discard only if you are prepared to
   reinstall all applications that make use of OLE and if you can later
   reconstruct your Internet Config preferences.

<P><LI>If prompted to remove copies of the Microsoft Office 98 folder found on
   your drive, select Keep or Discard.
<P>
   Warning: If you've saved personal files within any of the Microsoft
   Office 98 folders, these will also be removed. You should rescue these
   files before you empty the Trash.

<P><LI>From the desktop, empty the Trash.
<P>
</OL><h3>Removing Previous Versions of Office Applications</h3>
 
<P>
When you install Office 98 by dragging the Microsoft Office 98 folder,
Office 98 does not remove files from any previous versions of Office or
Office applications from your hard disk. When you run Microsoft Office
Installer, the Installer offers to remove installations of previous
versions of Office. However, you may not want to remove old Office
applications at that time.
<P>
The Office 98 Remove Old Office Versions application allows you to find and
remove most files left behind by previous installations of Office or Office
applications (Excel, PowerPoint, or Word). This section describes how to
use Remove Old Office Versions and how you can customize its operation.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Remove Old Office Versions</h3>
 
<P>
Remove Old Office Versions helps you find and Remove Old Office Versions
that you no longer need on your computer. Remove Old Office Versions can
remove components of the following versions of Office applications:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 4.2.1a and earlier versions (this includes
   Excel 5.0, PowerPoint 4.0, and Word 6.0)
<LI>Excel 4.0
<LI>PowerPoint 3.0b
<LI>Word 5.0, 5.1 and 5.1a
<P>
</UL>To start the Remove Old Office Versions application

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Microsoft Office CD into the appropriate drive.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    If you copied the Value Pack folder to a network drive, connect to
    that drive.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Open the Value Pack:Administration Tools folder.

<P><LI>Double-click Remove Old Office Versions.
<P>
</OL><h3>Installing Value Pack Components</h3>
 
<P>
The Value Pack components fall into two categories:

<UL><LI>Components that can be dragged from the Value Pack folder onto a local
   or network drive.

<LI>Components that must be installed to a hard disk using the Value Pack
   Installer. (This can only be done if the client is running Office
   locally)
<P>
</UL>Value Pack Installer does not support installation to a network drive as
Microsoft Office Installer does. You can run Value Pack Installer from a
network drive to install components onto a hard disk, but you cannot use it
to install components onto a network drive.
<P>
To run Value Pack Installer from a network drive to install components onto
a hard disk, Office programs must be installed locally on the hard disk
because Value Pack Installer won't start if the Microsoft Office 98 file is
not located on the hard disk.
<P>
To install Value Pack components onto a hard disk

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Microsoft Office CD into the appropriate drive.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE><P>
   If you copied the Value Pack folder to a network drive, connect to
   that drive.

<P><LI>Open the Value Pack folder.

<P><LI>Double-click Value Pack Installer.

<P><LI>Choose the specific Value Pack components you want to install.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE><P>
   To install all Value Pack components, click Select All.

<P><LI>Click Install.
<P>
</OL>Value Pack Installer then installs the components the Microsoft Office 98
folder or System Folder.
<P>
You can include Value Pack components in a customized Office network
installation point. The following procedure requires you to have previously
created a network installation point in a folder named Microsoft Office 98.
For information about creating a network installation point, see
"Customizing Client Installations" earlier in this document.
<P>
To install Value Pack components onto a network installation point

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Microsoft Office CD into the appropriate drive.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -or-
</PRE>
<P><LI>If you copied the Value Pack folder to a network drive, connect to
   that drive.

<P><LI>Open the Value Pack folder.

<P><LI>In the Value Pack folder, drag the specific components you want into
   the appropriate location within the Microsoft Office folder on your
   network drive.
<P>
</OL>Some Value Pack components such as text converters must be copied to a
specific folder to function properly. In most cases the Value Pack folder
in which these components reside correspond to the Microsoft Office folder
name into which they should be copied. For example, the Value Pack:Text
Converters folder contains items that should be copied to the Microsoft
Office 98:Shared Applications:Text Converters folder.
<P>
While most components can be copied directly from the Value Pack folder to
the network installation point, a few Value Pack components must be
installed to the System folder on the client hard disk to work properly.
Examples of such components include fonts and the Microsoft Office Manager
control panel. If these components are copied from a network installation
point to a client computer, they do not work properly without additional
steps.
<P>
Your options for deploying such components include:

<UL><LI>Run Value Pack Installer locally or from a network drive, and install
   the components you want onto the correct location on the client hard
   disk. (Only if the client is running Office locally)

<LI>Manually copy Value Pack components to the correct location on the
   client hard disk. For example, manually copy fonts from the Value
   Pack:Fonts folder to the System Folder:Fonts folder on each client
   computer on which you want the fonts.

<LI>Use a Macintosh network management program to push these components
   from a network drive to the correct folder on a client hard disk.
   For example, use a third party network management program to push the
   Microsoft Office Manager control panel from a network location to the
   System Folder:Control Panels folder on each client hard disk.
<P>
</UL>In fact, you can use any of these options for deploying any Value Pack
component. These options may be the most useful if you decide to deploy a
Value Pack component after deploying Office and you don't want to reinstall
Office (with Value Pack components added) on your client computers.
<P>
Default Save Templates
<P>
The Value Pack contains some additional support files that you may want to
use to simplify the administrative work of setting the default save format
for your users. These files contain a macro that changes the default format
for Microsoft Word documents, Microsoft Excel workbooks, and Microsoft
PowerPoint presentations. The files are contained in the Value
Pack:Administration Tools:Default Save folder.
<P>
The Value Pack Installer does not install these additional support files.
Use one of the following methods to administer your users default save
format settings.
<P>
<PRE>  - Copy the Word, Excel and PowerPoint files you need to the startup
    folder for each program you are using. For example, copy the Default
    Save As Word 6 template to the Microsoft Office
    98:Office:Startup:Word folder. When the user starts the program for
    the first time, the macro changes the default save format, and then
    the template is automatically moved to the Trash. Putting the Word,
    Excel and PowerPoint default save files you want into the startup
    folders is something that can be done before the Microsoft Office 98

</PRE></OL><h3>Installing Outlook Express and Microsoft Internet Explorer</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Outlook Express 4.0 for the Macintosh is a new application that
builds upon Microsoft Internet Mail and News. Outlook Express allows
Macintosh users to communicate with others on the Internet through e-mail
and newsgroups.
<P>
The Microsoft Internet folder on the Microsoft Office CD includes Microsoft
Internet Explorer 4.0a and Outlook Express. The Microsoft Internet Explorer
and Outlook Express installation is not integrated into the Office or Value
Pack installation process. Because both Outlook Express and Microsoft
Internet Explorer require configuration settings beyond Office, you should
deploy both in a separate rollout effort.
For corporate rollouts, the Microsoft Internet Explorer Administration Kit
(IEAK) 4.0 enables you to deploy, customize, and maintain Microsoft
Internet Explorer and Outlook Express from one central location across
multiple computer platforms.
<P>
World Wide Web: For the latest information about or to download the IEAK,
