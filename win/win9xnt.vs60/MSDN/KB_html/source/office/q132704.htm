The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office version 7.0 over an existing version of
Microsoft Office, not all of the files from the existing version of Office
are removed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because the Microsoft Office version 7.0 Setup program
does not remove all of the files from a previous version of Microsoft
Office, even when you install the newer version to the directory that
contains the earlier version.
<P>
The following files are not removed from the Microsoft Office folder when
you install Microsoft Office version 7.0 over an earlier version of Office:

<UL><LI>The Office 4.x clipart: Most of the files located in the
   CLIPART\PCSFILES folder in the Microsoft Office folder are files
   remaining from the earlier version of Office. Office version 7.0
   installs and uses only two files in this folder, POPULAR.CAG and
   POPULAR.PCS. The clipart files from the earlier version of Office that
   are not used by Office version 7.0 add up to approximately 12.1
   megabytes (MB).

<LI>The PowerPoint samples, templates, and wizards: The POWERPNT folder in
   the Microsoft Office folder contains two folders remaining from the
   earlier version of Office. These two folders, TEMPLATE and WIZARDS,
   contain approximately 3.03 MB of files that are not used by Microsoft
   Office version 7.0.

<LI>Microsoft Word templates and tutorial: The WINWORD folder in the
   Microsoft Office folder contains two folders remaining from the earlier
   version of Office. These two folders, TEMPLATE and WORDCBT contain
   approximately 763K of files that are not used by Microsoft Office
   version 7.0.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The method that is recommended to avoid this behavior is to run the Setup
program for the earlier version of Microsoft Office in maintenance mode,
and choose Remove All, before you install Microsoft Office version 7.0.
This method insures that all unnecessary files are removed from your hard
disk, freeing up additional disk space, before you install the new version
of Office.
<P>
If you have already installed Microsoft Office version 7.0, you can delete
the unnecessary files remaining from the previous version of Office by
using Windows Explorer or My Computer. You can delete the files in the
following folders (where MSOFFICE is the folder to which you installed
Microsoft Office):
<P>
<PRE>   MSOFFICE\CLIPART\PCSFILES (except POPULAR.CAG and POPULAR.PCS)
   MSOFFICE\POWERPNT\WIZARDS
   MSOFFICE\POWERPNT\TEMPLATE
   MSOFFICE\WINWORD\TEMPLATE
   MSOFFICE\WINWORD\WORDCBT

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you do not run Setup for the previous version of Office and choose
Remove All before you install Office version 7.0, a complete installation
of Office will use approximately 120.3 MB of disk space instead of
approximately 89.0 MB.
<P>

an existing version of Office before you install Office version 7.0, please
