<P><h2>SYMPTOM</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Office Manager (MOM) versions 4.0 and later, you will be
unable to activate an active application by choosing the built-in buttons
on the MOM toolbar if the executable file for the application has been
renamed.
<P>
For example, if you rename the Microsoft Excel 5.0 executable file
(EXCEL.EXE) to EXCEL5.EXE, MOM will not switch to a running instance of
Microsoft Excel when you choose the built-in Microsoft Excel button on the
toolbar. Instead, a new instance of Microsoft Excel will be started.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Office Manager attempts to see if an application is running by
looking for the original filename (EXCEL.EXE, for example) in memory. If
this original filename is not found, a new instance of the application is
started.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you want to use the MOM toolbar to switch to an application that has a
renamed executable file, create a custom button to start the application.
With a custom button, you do not need the original filename to be able to
switch to an application.
<P>
Note that a second instance of the application may be started if you are
using alternative shells such as PC Tools for Windows. This will occur if
the running instance of the application is not visible on the screen or is
in a "virtual" screen. If this is the case, activate the "virtual" screen
where the application is located, and then select the tool on the MOM
toolbar.

Manager, see Microsoft Office Help.
