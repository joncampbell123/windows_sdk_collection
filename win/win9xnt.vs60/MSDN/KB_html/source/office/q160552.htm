</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems may occur if a corrupted AutoCorrect list (.acl) file is
stored in the Windows folder on the computer.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve these problems, use one of the following methods.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Download the Microsoft Office 97 SR-1 Patch</h3>
 
<P>
For additional information about SR-1, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../office/q172475.htm">Q172475</A></B>
   TITLE     : OFF97: How to Obtain and Install MS Office 97 SR-1

</PRE><h3>Method 2: Download the AutoCorrect Utility</h3>
 
<P>
The following file is available for download from the Microsoft
Software Library:
<P>
<PRE> ~ <A href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/aclutil.exe">Aclutil.exe</A> <I>(size: 26259 bytes)</I> 
                 26K self-extracting file
                 contains Aclfix.exe and Aclread.txt

</PRE>For more information about downloading files from the Microsoft Software
Library, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../zmiscellaneous/q119591.htm">Q119591</A></B>
   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

</PRE><h3>Method 3: Rename the .acl files (except Mso97.acl)</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, point to Find, and click Files Or Folders.

<P><LI>In the Named box, type "*.acl", without quotation marks. In
   the Look In box, type the path to the Windows folder (for
   example, type C:\Windows). Then, click Find Now.
<P>
   When the search is completed, a list of .acl files appears. These
   files are stored in the Windows folder.
<P>
   IMPORTANT: One of the .acl files is named Mso97.acl. Do not rename or
   delete this file unless you are instructed to do so by Microsoft
   Technical Support, or you completely remove Microsoft Office 97
   from the computer.

<P><LI>Right-click one of the .acl files (for example, User.acl). Then, click
   Rename on the shortcut menu.

<P><LI>Press END. Then, type ".old" (without the quotation marks) and press
   ENTER.
<P>
   The file appears with ".old" appended to the end (for example,
   User.acl.old).

<P><LI>Except for Mso97.acl, repeat steps 3 and 4 for all .acl files in the
   Windows folder.
<P>
</OL>After you rename the .acl files, the problems described in this article no
longer occur.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Office 97 for
Windows. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Office 97 SR-1.
<P>
For additional information about SR-1, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../office/q172475.htm">Q172475</A></B>
   TITLE     : OFF97: How to Obtain and Install MS Office 97 SR-1

</PRE></OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
All of the programs included with Microsoft Office 97 support a feature
called AutoCorrect. AutoCorrect automatically corrects text as you type
it, fixing mistakes like accidentally typing two initial capitals, or
correcting commonly misspelled words.
<P>
For each person who uses the computer, AutoCorrect settings and words are
maintained separately in a file called &lt;User name&gt;.acl, where &lt;User name&gt;
is the user's profile. This file is stored in the Windows folder on the
computer.
<P>
If this file becomes corrupted for any reason, you may encounter one or
more of the problems described in this article when you start Microsoft
Word 97 or Microsoft Outlook 97, or when you attempt to display the
AutoCorrect dialog box in any program.
<P>
When you rename or delete a &lt;Username&gt;.acl file, a new &lt;Username&gt;.acl file
is created when you start Microsoft Word 97 or Microsoft Outlook 97, or
when you display the AutoCorrect dialog box in any program.
<P>
Note that the file Mso97.acl is a special AutoCorrect file. Do not rename
or delete it unless you have completely removed Microsoft Office 97 from
the computer.
