<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Both the "Getting Results with Microsoft Office for Windows 95" book and
the online Getting Results Book contain the following information:
<P>
<PRE>   Upgrading from a previous version of Office--You don't need to remove
   the existing version of Office. The setup program will install Office
   for Windows 95 to a new location, and you can choose whether or not to
   remove the existing version of Office. Setup preserves the documents,
   templates, and other files you created so you can continue using them in
   Office for Windows 95.

</PRE>Although the Office Setup program does ask if you would like to remove your
previous version of Office (if it detects a previous version on your
computer), the recommended method for upgrading to Office version 7.0 is to
remove the previous version of Office first, before you run the Office
version 7.0 Setup program.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you upgrade to Microsoft Office version 7.0, you should first run the
Setup program for your previous version of Office in maintenance mode, and
choose the Remove All button. This will remove all of the files that you do
not need if you are installing Office version 7.0. If you use the Office
version 7.0 Setup program to remove the existing version of Office instead
of the Remove All feature from the previous version of Office, not all of
the files from the previous version of Office are removed. This results in
multiple Office items on the Windows Start menu, duplicate files on your
hard disk, and files from your previous version of Office that are not used
by Office version 7.0.
<P>
NOTE: If you are installing Microsoft Office Standard for Windows 95,
version 7.0, over Microsoft Office Professional, version 4.3c or earlier,
you should not remove Microsoft Access.
<P>
For additional information about the symptoms that occur when you do not
remove an existing version of Office before installing Office version 7.0,
please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
