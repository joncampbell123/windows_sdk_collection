The information in this article applies to:

<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows and Bookshelf, 1994 edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Office version 4.3c-CD ships with Microsoft Bookshelf, and it
also includes the option to install Microsoft Bookshelf integration with
Microsoft Word for Windows. Along with Lotus Notes/FX support, and some
additional demonstration files, the option to use the Microsoft Word for
Windows and Bookshelf integration is one of the major differences between
Microsoft Office version 4.3-CD and version 4.3c-CD.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following information describes the functionality that is added to
Microsoft Word and Bookshelf if you install Microsoft Bookshelf, and you
select the Integration With Microsoft Word item.
<P>
The BSWORD.HLP file is installed to your Microsoft Word directory. This
file is the Bookshelf help file that provides information about Microsoft
Word and Bookshelf integration.
<P>
The BSWORD.DOT file is installed to your Microsoft Word MACROS
subdirectory. This template contains Microsoft Word &amp; Bookshelf Macros
and the Microsoft QuickShelf toolbar. The Microsoft QuickShelf toolbar
contains the following buttons, and each button runs the corresponding
macro:

</PRE>The add-in file BSH.WLL is installed to your Microsoft Word STARTUP
subdirectory. This add-in adds the Daily Update and Define commands
to your View menu, and adds the Define command to the shortcut menu.
<P>
The BSH.WLL add-in provides the functionality of displaying the Daily
Update dialog box whenever you start Microsoft Word, and when you
choose Daily Update from the View menu. This dialog box allows you to
view a Quote of the Day, Word of the Day, an event that occurred on
This Day in History, or a Microsoft Word 6.0 Tip of the Day.
<P>
To use the Define command on either the View menu or the shortcut
menu, you can select a word in your document, then either choose
Define from the View menu, or click the right mouse button and then
choose Define from the shortcut menu. This displays a Bookshelf
dialog box that contains a definition of the selected word.
<P>
Microsoft Bookshelf also has special links for Word for Windows. You
can select an article or a portion of an article in Microsoft
Bookshelf, and then choose Copy To Word from the Edit menu. This
allows you to automatically copy and paste text to a new document,
the current location, or the end of any open document in Microsoft
Word.
