The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.2, 4.3
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office Setup program, and you choose the
Complete/Custom installation option or Maintenance mode, the following
information is displayed when you select the Shared Applications option if
you have previously installed one of the shared applications (for example
Equation Editor, WordArt) to a network drive:
<P>
<PRE>   Space Required on ?:     0K
   Space Available on ?:    0K

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if the Setup program finds one or more shared
applications (MSAPPS) registered in the WIN.INI file or the REG.DAT file
that are using a universal naming convention (UNC) path name. For example,
this behavior occurs when you run the Microsoft Office Setup program if the
Equation Editor has previously been installed and is registered in the
WIN.INI file and the REG.DAT file with the following path information:
<P>
<PRE>   \\SERVER\SHARE\WINWORD\MSAPPS\EQUATION\EQNEDIT.EXE

</PRE>The "?" is used because the UNC path does not have a one character drive
letter. The "0K" value appears because the Setup program cannot determine
the amount of available disk space on a UNC drive.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Office Setup program installs the MSAPPS to an existing
UNC path location under the following conditions:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Office Setup program is installing shared applications
   that have the same version as those that are already installed.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The Microsoft Office Setup program is installing a newer version of the
   shared applications than those that are installed, and the Setup program
   can write to this location. If the Setup program cannot write to the
   location of the shared applications, then each of the new shared
   applications are copied to the local hard drive.
<P>
</UL>For more information about Microsoft Office Setup installing shared
applications locally, query on the following words in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   workstation and locally and installs
