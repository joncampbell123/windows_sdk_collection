The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If Microsoft Imager is installed on your computer and you run the Microsoft
Office 97 Setup program, Microsoft Imager 2.0 is removed.
<P>
In addition, tagged image file format (.tif) files and bitmap (.bmp) files
remain associated with Imager even though it does not exist on the
computer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Office 97 Setup removes Microsoft Imager regardless of whether
you click Yes or No when you are prompted to remove all older versions of
Microsoft Office.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, use either of the following two methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Reinstall Microsoft Imager</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to continue using Microsoft Imager, reinstall it by using
the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>After Microsoft Office 97 Setup is completed successfully, insert the
   Microsoft Office 7.0 compact disc into the CD-ROM drive.
<P>
   If the Microsoft Office for Windows 95 screen appears, click Browse CD
   Contents.

<P><LI>If the Microsoft Office for Windows 95 screen does not appear, double-
   click My Computer and right-click the CD-ROM drive. Click Open on
   the shortcut menu. Locate the Valupack folder on the compact disc
   and double-click the folder to open it.

<P><LI>Double-click the Imager folder.

<P><LI>In the Imager folder, double-click Setup.exe to run the Microsoft
   Imager Setup program.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Use Microsoft Photo Editor</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Office 97 compact disc includes a program called Microsoft
Photo Editor. This program is not installed as part of a Typical
installation. Photo Editor is one of the Office Tools that you can install
during a Custom installation of the Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
If you want to use Microsoft Photo Editor instead of Microsoft Imager,
install Photo Editor by using the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program and click Add/Remove.

<P><LI>Click Office Tools, click Change Options, and then click to select the
   Photo Editor check box.

<P><LI>Click Continue to complete the Setup program.
<P>
<P>
</OL>To reassociate the *.bmp and *.tif files with Microsoft Photo Editor or
Microsoft Paint, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

</PRE></OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Imager is included on the Microsoft Office 7.0 compact disc and
can be installed from the Valupack folder. Microsoft Imager does not
require that Microsoft Office 7.0 be installed on your computer.
<P>
Microsoft Photo Editor is included on the Microsoft Office 97 compact disc
and can be installed as part of a Custom installation.
<P>
NOTE: Microsoft Imager 2.0 is removed by installing Microsoft Office 97.
However, if you do not remove earlier versions of Microsoft Office when you
are prompted by Setup, Microsoft Imager 2.0 is not removed from the
programs in the Add/Remove Programs list in Control Panel. If you click
Microsoft Imager 2.0 in the Add/Remove Programs dialog box and you click
Add/Remove, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   An error occurred while trying to remove Microsoft Imager 2.0.
   Uninstallation has been canceled.

</PRE>To remove Microsoft Imager 2.0 from the Add/Remove programs, you can edit
the Windows 95 registry.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
before you edit the registry.
<P>
To remove Microsoft Imager 2.0 from the Add/Remove programs, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start and click Run. In the Run box, type "regedit" (without the
   quotation marks). This step opens the Registry Editor.

<P><LI>Locate and delete the following Registry key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Current Version\
      Uninstall\Imager32
</PRE>
<P><LI>On the Registry menu, click Exit to close the Registry Editor.

<P><LI>Restart your computer.
