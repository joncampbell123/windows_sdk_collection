The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.2, 4.2c, 4.3, 4.3c
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you want to install Microsoft Office in a networked environment, you can
perform an administrative installation (Setup /a) of Microsoft Office.
After you perform an administrative installation, and Setup copies the
files to the network server, you and other users can perform different
types of installations. These types are listed in the following table.

</PRE>This article explains the advantages and disadvantages of performing a
Workstation or a Run From Network Server installation of Microsoft Office.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Advantages</h3>
 
<P>
When you perform a Workstation or a Run From Network Server installation,
you can take advantage of the following benefits:

<UL><LI>You can minimize the amount of hard disk space that is used on each
   computer. When you or other users perform this type of installation, the
   amount of disk space that Office requires is less than the amount that
   it requires when you perform a Typical, Custom/Complete, or a
   Compact/Laptop installation from the Office disks or compact discs. This
   is important if there is limited free hard disk space on your computer.

<LI>You can run Microsoft Office on a diskless workstation. If you or other
   users have diskless workstations, you can still run Microsoft Office if
   you perform a Workstation or Run From Network Server installation of
   Office.
<P>
</UL><h3>Disadvantages</h3>
 
<P>
When you perform a Workstation or a Run From Network Server installation,
you should be aware of the following disadvantages:

<UL><LI>When you perform an administrative installation of Microsoft Office,
   more hard disk space is used on the server. The amount of disk space on
   the server that is required ranges from 100 MB to 325 MB (or more,
   depending on the version of Microsoft Office). If your network server is
   used by other programs or is used to store data files, the server may
   not have enough free disk space.

<LI>When you perform a Workstation or a Run From Network Server
   installation, program performance may be slowed by high volumes of
   network traffic or by heavy use of the network server. In addition, if
   the server is not operating (for example, for maintenance or repairs),
   you and other users cannot use the Microsoft Office programs.

<LI>When you perform a Workstation or a Run From Network Server
   installation, you must be connected to the network server in to run any
   of the Office programs.
<P>
   For example, if you have a laptop computer you should not perform a
   Workstation or a Run From Network Server installation of Office if you
   plan to use the computer outside of the office.
<P>
   NOTE: Although it may be possible to connect to your network by
   modem and remote network access, Microsoft recommends that you do NOT
   use this method to run Office. The amount of time that is required to
   download all of the files to run a single program is significant (10 to
   20 minutes or more).
<P>
</UL>Note that the last two disadvantages (slower performance and a network
connection) are not problematic if you perform Typical, Custom/Complete, or
Compact/Laptop installations of Office from the network server. In each of
these types of installations, all files that are required are copied to the
local hard disk. A connection to the network server is required only if
additional files must be installed, or if you want to properly remove
Office from the computer by running the Microsoft Office Setup program.
