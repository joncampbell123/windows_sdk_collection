The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, versions 4.2, 4.2.1, 4.2.1a,
   4.2.1b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Microsoft Office Setup installation maintenance program, and
you choose to remove any of the fonts installed by Microsoft Office, the
files appear to be removed, and Setup completes successfully; however, the
font files are not removed from your hard disk drive.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Office. Fonts are not removed,
because the Setup program doesn't know which application was used to
install the font files. However, these files are listed in either the
Components Not Yet Installed list or in the Installed Components list in
the maintenance Setup dialog box so that you can install them again if they
are deleted from your hard drive.
<P>
Note that if you do remove any of the fonts using the Microsoft Office
Setup program, the next time you run Office Setup, the fonts that you
removed are listed in the Components Not Yet Installed list even though the
files were not actually removed.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To remove installed fonts from your computer, you can do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Run Microsoft Office Setup.

<P><LI>In the Microsoft Office Setup dialog box, choose the Add/Remove button.

<P><LI>In the Installed Components list, click the triangle next to Tools to
   display the list of Tools options. Clear the check box next to each
   option under Tools except for the check box next to Fonts.
<P>
   To remove specific fonts, click the triangle next to Fonts to display
   the  list of individual fonts, and clear the check box next to any font
   you  do NOT want to remove.

<P><LI>Choose Continue.

<P><LI>When Setup is complete, double-click the System Folder, then double-
   click the Fonts folder in the Finder.

<P><LI>Drag the corresponding files to the trash.
<P>
