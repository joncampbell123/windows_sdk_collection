The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT versions 3.51, 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Project for Windows, versions 4.1, 4.1a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office 97 on a computer running Microsoft
Windows NT version 3.51 or 4.0, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup Error 168
   Setup has encountered a problem updating your system registry.

</PRE>When you click OK, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Office 97 Setup was not completed successfully.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You log on to a computer running Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 or 4.0 by
   using an account that is a member of the Users group but that is NOT a
   member of the Administrators group.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You perform a Custom installation of Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>In the Custom dialog box, you change the folders used by any of the
   programs (Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint,
   Microsoft Access) to a folder other than the default folder.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Do not change the default folders of any of the programs included in
   Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Before you run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program, log on to
   Microsoft Windows NT by using an account that is a member of the
   Administrators group. After you do this, run Microsoft Office 97 Setup.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: If you use the second method, you may encounter problems when you log
on to the computer by using a different account, and then attempt to use
any of the programs included in Microsoft Office 97. Use this method with
caution.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Windows NT and Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office 97 on a computer running either Microsoft
Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows NT, the Setup program creates the following
key in the registry.
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\8.0\BinDirPath

</PRE>This key indicates where certain files that are used by Microsoft Office 97
programs are stored. The presence of this key is all that is usually
required for the programs included in Microsoft Office 97 to work
correctly.
<P>
However, if you change the folder in which any of the Microsoft Office 97
programs are installed, you must change the PATH value, so that the
programs can find the files they need to run. On a computer running
Microsoft Windows 95, the PATH value is stored in the Autoexec.bat file,
which is located in the root directory on drive C.
<P>
Under Microsoft Windows NT, the PATH information is stored in the following
key in the registry:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\
      Session Manager\Environment\Path

</PRE>If you logged on to the computer by using an account that is a member of
the Administrators group, the Setup program is able to change the value of
this registry key. However, if you logged on to the computer by using an
account that is not a member of the Administrators group, this key cannot
be changed by the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program, and you receive the
error messages described in the "Symptoms" section in this article.
<P>
The easiest solution to this problem is to allow the Microsoft Office 97
Setup program to install each program in the default folder; if you do
this, Microsoft Office 97 Setup runs correctly even if you logged on to the
computer by using a non-administrative account.
<P>
