<P><h3>Overview</h3>
 
<P>
The "Office Manager Patch for 7.5.2" file included with this
Application Note updates Microsoft Office Manager (MOM) version 4.2.1
for the Macintosh. The patch corrects a problem you may encounter when
you use MOM on a Macintosh running System 7.5.2. To use this patch,
you must have Microsoft Office version 4.2.1 or 4.2.1a installed on
your computer.
<P>
This patch revises the way MOM handles an application programming
interface (API) call that was changed in System 7.5.2 from earlier
versions of System 7. Because the API call was changed in System
7.5.2, MOM hangs (stops responding) when it makes the API call. Apple
has confirmed this to be a problem in System 7.5.2.
<P>
<P><h3>To Install the MOM Patch</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Hold down the SHIFT key and restart your computer. Release the
   SHIFT key when the "Welcome to Macintosh. Extensions Off." message
