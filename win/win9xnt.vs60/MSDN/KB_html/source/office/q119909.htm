<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office version 4.2 Setup program, and you
install the application to the directory the contains Microsoft Office
version 4.0, the following files that are included in version 4.0,
but are not included in version 4.2 are not removed from your
Microsoft Office directory:
<P>
<PRE>   OFF40_BB.DLL
   \CLIPART\OFF40ART.IDX
   \EXCEL\QEDBF.DLL
   \EXCEL\QEORA.DLL
   \EXCEL\QERDB.DLL
   \EXCEL\QESS.DLL
   \EXCEL\QETXT.DLL
   \EXCEL\QEXLA.DLL
   \EXCEL\QEXLS.DLL
   \EXCEL\SQSAPIW.DLL
   \EXCEL\W3DBLIB.DLL
   \EXCEL\EXCELDE.EXE
   \EXCEL\QE.EXE
   \EXCEL\QE.HLP

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design. The files that are left in the Microsoft
Excel directory are files that are installed by Microsoft Excel
version 4.0, that are not removed when you install Microsoft Excel
5.0. These files that are left are for the Dialog Editor, and the
Microsoft Q+E applications. You can still use these applications with
Microsoft Excel version 5.0, however the functionality that these
applications provide has been replaced by dialog sheets, and Microsoft
Query, included with Microsoft Excel version 5.0.
