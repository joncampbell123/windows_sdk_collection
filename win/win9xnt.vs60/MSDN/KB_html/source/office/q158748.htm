<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Microsoft Quick View for Windows 95 to open a file created in
one of the Microsoft Office 97 programs listed at the beginning of this
article, you may not be able to preview the file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Quick View for Windows 95 cannot directly preview files created
in any of the Microsoft Office 97 programs.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this behavior, use one of the methods below.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Save The File In A Different Format</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Excel 97:
<P>
Save the file in the "Microsoft Excel 97 &amp; 5.0/95 Workbook" format.
Microsoft Quick View for Windows 95 can preview Microsoft Excel workbooks
that you save in this format. To save the file, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the file in Microsoft Excel 97.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save As.

<P><LI>In the Save As dialog box, click "Microsoft Excel 97 &amp; 5.0/95 Workbook
   (*.xls)" in the Save As Type list.

<P><LI>Type a new name in the File Name box.

<P><LI>Click Save.

<P><LI>Close the file.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: When you save a Microsoft Excel 97 workbook in the "Microsoft Excel
97 &amp; 5.0/95 Workbook" format, you may encounter problems if you open and
save the document in earlier versions of Microsoft Excel (for example,
some
items are not supported in earlier versions of Microsoft Excel).

</PRE></OL><h3>Method 2: Use "Open File for Editing" in Quick View</h3>
 
<P>
If you use Quick View to open a file created in any of the Microsoft
Office
97 programs listed at the beginning of this article, and you do not see
any
data in the document, on the File menu, click "Open File for Editing."
This
command starts the Microsoft Office 97 program in which the file was
created (if it is not running), and opens the file just as if was opened
directly by that program.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Quick View, which is installed by Microsoft Windows 95, allows you to view
documents that are created by Windows-based programs without starting the
program. If Quick View is not available on the shortcut menu, either the
program that created the file does not support Quick View, or Quick View
is
not installed on the computer. Please see your Windows 95 documentation
for information about installing Quick View on your computer.
