The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.3c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office Setup program, you may receive one of the
following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Bad system value in INF file

   -or-

   Bad first character on inf line

   -or-

   Bad System Value in INF File Description Line

</PRE>The only option is to choose OK, and your are forced to exit the Microsoft
Office Setup program before Setup is complete.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if you choose to install Microsoft Excel to a directory
that contains Microsoft Excel version 4.0, and you choose to update the
existing version.
<P>
The error also occurs if you have had an unsuccessful installation of
Microsoft Excel 5.0c and any files remain in the directory location.
Removing the directory prior to attempting a new install prevents this
error message.
<P>
The error message is caused by an incorrect line in the [XL4 Q+E Files]
section of the SETUP.INF file. This line is used only when you install
Microsoft Excel 5.0c (using Microsoft Office version 4.3c Setup) to a
directory that contains Microsoft Excel 4.0 files, so that the previous
Microsoft Excel files are removed during installation.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.
<P>
Method 1: Run the Microsoft Office Setup again, and install Microsoft Excel
<PRE>          to a new directory that does not contain any files. You should
          delete the old target directory (for example, MSOFFICE), the
          ~MSSTFQF.T directory and any of its subdirectories.

</PRE>Method 2: Modify the SETUP.INF file, contained on Disk 1, by doing the
following:
<P>
<PRE>          a. Make a backup copy of SETUP.INF.

          b. Open the SETUP.INF file in a text editor such as Microsoft
             Write and when you are prompted, choose "No Conversion". This
             file is located on Disk 1 of the Microsoft Office 4.3c Setup
             disks. Note: the file is too large to be opened in Notepad.

          c. Search for the string "system ," (without the quotation
             marks). Note the space between the word "system" and the
             comma. This string "system ," is found in the [XL4 Q+E Files]
             section.

          d. Delete the space between the word "system" and the comma.

          e. Save the SETUP.INF file as text, and run the Microsoft Office
             setup program again.

             Note: in some cases, when you attempt to save the SETUP.INF
             file in Write after modifying it, you will receive the error
             message "Not enough disk space." To workaround this issue
             temporarily, move the WDREADME.HLP file to your hard drive,
             then resave the SETUP.INF file to disk 1. When that is
             complete, move the WDREADME.HLP file back to disk 1 and the
             setup will proceed without error.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
