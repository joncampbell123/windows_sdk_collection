The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you choose the Office Setup And Uninstall command from the Microsoft
Office Manager (MOM) toolbar, you may receive following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find Microsoft Office setup. Please start Setup another way.

</PRE>Also, during certain Microsoft Office installations, an Office Setup
icon will not be created.
<P>
This is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
During a Typical or Complete Installation from the Microsoft Office 4.0
Standard or Professional packages, the Microsoft Office SETUP.EXE file is
installed. In addition, an Office Setup icon is created and placed in the
same program group where the Microsoft Office application icons are
created.
<P>
When you double-click the Office Setup icon or when you choose the Office
Setup And Uninstall command from the Microsoft Office Manager toolbar menu,
the SETUP.EXE file runs Office Maintenance Mode Setup.
<P>
The SETUP.EXE file and the Office Setup icon are unavailable in the
following installations of the Microsoft Office 4.0 Standard or
Professional packages:

<UL><LI>Workstation Installation
<LI>Minimum Installation
<LI>Custom/Complete Installation (if the Tools option is not selected)
<P>
</UL>These installations cause the above message to be displayed when you choose
the Office Setup And Uninstall command from the Microsoft Office menu.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To run Setup when the SETUP.EXE file is not installed, follow the
appropriate procedure below.
<P>
<P><h3>If Microsoft Office was installed from a network server</h3>
 
<P>
