<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the Microsoft Office 97 programs listed at the beginning of this
article, there is no key or combination of keys on the keyboard that you
can use to dismiss the Office Assistant.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You can only dismiss the Office Assistant by using a mouse or other
pointing device.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of the programs included with Microsoft Office
97.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you right-click the Office Assistant window in any Microsoft Office 97
program, one of the choices on the shortcut menu that appears is "Hide
Assistant". Because the "H" in "Hide" is underlined, if you press "h" while
the shortcut menu is visible, the Office Assistant will be dismissed. There
is no way to achieve this using only the keyboard.
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for

but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
It is possible, however, to write a Visual Basic for Applications macro to
display or hide the Office Assistant. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub ToggleOfficeAssistant()
      Assistant.Visible = Not Assistant.Visible
   End Sub

</PRE>When you run this macro, if the Office Assistant is visible, it will be
dismissed. If the Office Assistant is not visible, it will be displayed.
This macro will work in all programs included with Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
In Microsoft Excel 97, you can assign a shortcut key to the
ToggleOfficeAssistant macro by running the following macro:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub SetShortcutKey()
       Application.MacroOptions Macro:="ToggleOfficeAssistant", _
          HasShortcutKey:=True, ShortcutKey:="o"
   End Sub

</PRE>Once you have run the SetShortcutKey macro, press CTRL+o (the letter "o")
to run the ToggleOfficeAssistant macro and turn your Office Assistant on or
off.
