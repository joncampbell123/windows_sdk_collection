<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the Open and Save As dialog boxes, when you select a file then click the
Cut command on the shortcut menu, the icon next to the selected filename
does not appear dimmed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is different from the behavior in Explorer and in My Computer
in Windows 95. When you use the Cut command in Microsoft Explorer or My
Computer, the icon next to the selected filename appears dimmed, indicating
that the file has been cut.
<P>
When you use the Cut command in the Open or the Save As dialog box in one
of the Microsoft Office applications, such as Microsoft Word, the
appearance of the selected file does not change. There is no visual
indication that the file has been cut.
<P>
The Cut command functions as expected in the Open and Save As dialog boxes
in the Microsoft Office applications; that is, you can use the Paste
command in these dialog boxes after clicking the Cut command with a file
selected.
<P>
Note that when you use the Cut command in the Office programs, Windows
Explorer, or My Computer, the selected file does not actually disappear
from the folder until you paste the file to a new location.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For additional information about using the Cut command in the Open dialog
box on the Office Shortcut Bar, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
