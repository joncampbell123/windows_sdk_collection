<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Office for Windows 4.3c on CD-ROM does not contain the clip video
and sample video files that are referenced in the last dialog box of the
Microsoft Video for Windows Setup program. These sample files are not
included with Office; however, their exclusion does not impede the
performance or functionality of Video for Windows (VFW).
<P>
Note that these sample files are available if you purchase the Microsoft
Video for Windows CD separately.
<P>
