The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office 97 on a computer running an earlier
version of Microsoft Office that is shared over a network, the Setup
program deletes the shared components on the server. This behavior affects
other users who attempt to use these shared files.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the following conditions are all true:

<UL><LI>You perform a workstation installation of Microsoft Office that is
   earlier than Microsoft Office 97 for Windows on the computer.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>The network software you are using is Novell Netware version 4.10
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You have Delete rights on the server that contains the shared components
   of the earlier version of Microsoft Office.
<P>
<P><PRE>    -and-
</PRE>
<LI>You run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program and click Yes when you
   are prompted to remove files for the earlier version.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this behavior from occurring, use any of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
When you are prompted to remove earlier versions of Microsoft Office,
click No.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Assign the read-only attribute to all the Microsoft Office files on
the server.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 3</h3>
 
<P>
Log on to the network with user rights that do not allow you to delete
files on the network server, and then run the Microsoft Office Setup
program. See your network administrator to change your logon rights.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Office 97 for
Windows. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Office 97 SR-1 Enterprise
Update.
<P>
For additional information about SR-1, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../office/q172475.htm">Q172475</A></B>
   TITLE : OFF97: How to Obtain and Install MS Office 97 SR-1

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office locally on your computer, the Office 97
Setup program detects earlier versions of Office files and deletes these
files by design. However, when you install Office in a shared network
environment, all users who rely on the shared files are no longer able to
use these components.
