IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
AutoCorrect lists are now shared between Office applications. Any changes
you make to the AutoCorrect entries and settings while in one program are
immediately available to the other programs. In addition, Word can store
AutoCorrect items consisting of formatted text and graphics.
<P>
Information pertaining to AutoCorrect is stored in various locations.
<P>
<PRE>   This AutoCorrect information                 Is stored here
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   AutoCorrect entries shared by all            .acl file in the location
   programs                                     specified in the Windows
                                                registry

   AutoCorrect entries used only by             Normal.dot
   Word (formatted text and graphics)

   AutoCorrect settings (correct two initial    Windows registry
   capitals, capitalize names of days,
   replace text as you type)

   AutoCorrect settings used only by            Windows registry
   Word (Correct accidental usage of CAPS
   LOCK key, Capitalize first letter of
   sentences)

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, see the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
before you edit the registry.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee
that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
<P><h3>Shared AutoCorrect Items Stored in .ACL File</h3>
 
<P>
The first time you use one of the Office programs listed at the beginning
of this article, a default list of AutoCorrect items is copied from
Msoffice.acl to a new file, called &lt;username&gt;000.acl. If you have not
logged on to the computer as a specific user, the new file is called
User000.acl. This file is usually placed in the Windows folder.
<P>
When you add a new AutoCorrect entry in any of the Office programs, that
program immediately updates the .acl file. This new AutoCorrect entry is
now available to all the other programs which also use AutoCorrect.
<P>
<P><h3>Location of the .acl File</h3>
 
<P>
The .acl file is usually located in the Windows folder. To determine
where this file is stored, look in the Registry Editor under the
following key:
<P>
In Microsoft Office 97:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Microsoft Office\8.0\
   Common\AutoCorrect


</PRE>In Microsoft Office 95:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Microsoft Office\95\
   AutoCorrect\list

</PRE>If you have not logged on to the computer as a specific user, the entry
will be found under this key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\.Default\Software\Microsoft\Microsoft Office\95\
   AutoCorrect\list

</PRE><h3>Location of the Settings Information</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Office 95 other AutoCorrect settings are stored in the
same location, in the Settings key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Microsoft Office\95\
   AutoCorrect\settings

</PRE><h3>Word Stores Additional AutoCorrect Entries</h3>
 
<P>
Word's built-in list of AutoCorrect entries includes items that don't
appear in other programs, such as a colon and a closing parenthesis
that are replaced by a "smiley face" symbol.
<P>
Word can also store graphics and formatted text as AutoCorrect entries.
These entries are not available to other programs. (To store something as
an AutoCorrect entry in Word, type the text or insert the graphic you
want to store, select it, and then go to the Tools menu and click
AutoCorrect. The highlighted area will appear on the "With" side, and you
can type a short name in the "Replace" side.)
<P>
In Microsoft Office 95, Word's additional AutoCorrect options, Correct
Accidental Use Of CAPS LOCK Key and Capitalize First Letter Of Sentences
are stored in the Registry Editor under the following key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Word\7.0\Data
