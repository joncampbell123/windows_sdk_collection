</PRE>The following files update the AnswerWizard database (.aw) files for Word
97, Microsoft Excel 97, Outlook 97, and Office 97, Professional and
Standard editions, for Windows.
<P>
These updated files disable recognition of the words "post-it" or "postit"
(case insensitive) when the user queries AnswerWizard for suggested Help
topics. With these updated files, if either of those terms (standing alone)
is entered by the user when the user is prompted by the AnswerWizard, the
response that is returned is "I don't know what you mean. Please rephrase
your question." If the user enters "post it," the string "it" is ignored.
The engine searches for "post" and lists only Help topics that are related
to public folders (or other application- specific features that are
synonymous with the word "post" that are unrelated to the Outlook 97 Notes
utility); the engine does not list topics that are related to the Outlook
97 Notes utility.
<P>
There are no changes other than the above mentioned changes to the
AnswerWizard recognition of the specific term. There are no changes to the
Help contents.
<P>
This change has been implemented in the product and pertains only to the
first releases of Word 97, Microsoft Excel 97, Outlook 97, and Office 97
for Windows (Professional and Standard editions) in North America.
<P>
This update is applicable only if your .aw files (usually located in the
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office folder by default) have the same
date/time stamp.
<P>
To install the updated files, quit any Office programs that are running and
copy the files to the Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office folder on your
computer. (Note that you are replacing the existing files.)
