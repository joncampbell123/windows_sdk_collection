The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.3c-CD
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The version of the PICTIMP.FLT file that is shipped with Microsoft Office
version 4.3c-CD is not the latest version of this file. The version
included on the 4.3c-CD is version 2.2.0.1, the version that was shipped
with Microsoft Word version 6.0c, instead of version 2.3.0.4 that was
shipped with PowerPoint version 4.0c.
<P>
The version of the PICTIMP.FLT file that is located in the SETUP.ADM
directory on the Disk1 compact disk is the latest version of this file.
However, this version of the file is only installed if you run the Setup
program from an administrative installation of Microsoft Office.
<P>
Note that Microsoft Office version 4.2c and 4.3c contain the latest version
of this graphics filter file. You can use the following table to determine
the version of this filter that is installed on your computer:
<P>
<PRE>                   Version    Installed
                              File Size
   ------------------------------------
   PICTIMP.FLT     2.2.0.1    57600
   PICTIMP.FLT     2.3.0.4    58256

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To install the latest version of this file without running Setup from an
administrative installation of Microsoft Office, you can extract the file
from the MSOFF24.CAB file located in the DISK24 subdirectory of the
SETUP.ADM directory on the Disk 1 CD. To extract this file, use the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Copy EXTRACT.EXE (located in the Disk1 subdirectory of the SETUP.ADM
   directory) to the root directory of your local hard drive, or to a
   directory that is located in the PATH statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
   file.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS prompt, type the following as one line
<P>
<P><PRE>      extract /y &lt;drive&gt;:\setup.adm\disk24\msoff24.cab /L
       &lt;directory&gt;\msapps\grphflt pictimp.flt
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive that contains the Microsoft Office Disk 1 CD
   and &lt;directory&gt; is the path to you your Windows directory. For example
   if Disk 1 is in drive D and c:\windows is the path to you your Windows
   directory, type the following (all on one line):
<P>
<P><PRE>      extract /y d:\setup.adm\disk24\msoff24.cab /L
       c:\windows\msapps\grphflt pictimp.flt
</PRE><P>
   Note that if you use the /y switch, the existing compressed file will be
   overwritten, and you will not be prompted whether you want this change
   to occur.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
