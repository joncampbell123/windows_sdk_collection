<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you use AppleScript, you should know which Apple Events or commands
are supported by the programs you are working with. Not all Apple Events
are supported by every program.
<P>
The "More Information" section of this article explains a method to
determine which Apple Events are supported by a program.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
AppleScript is a macro language that ships with Macintosh System 7.5 or
later. You can use AppleScript to automate repetitive tasks. A program must
have the code to support specific Apple Events; otherwise your AppleScript
commands are ignored. To be System 7 compliant, a program must support the
following Apple Events:
<P>
<PRE>   Open
   Print
   Quit
   Run

</PRE>Use the steps below to determine which events/commands are supported
by the program you are working with.

<OL><P><LI>Start Script Editor.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Open Dictionary.

<P><LI>Navigate to the location of the program you are working with.

<P><LI>Highlight the program within the open dialog box.

<P><LI>Click the Open button to open the supported event list.
<P>
</OL>The left side of the Dictionary window lists the events supported by the
selected program.
<P>
NOTE: You may receive a message similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not read the dictionary of the program or extension
   because it is not scriptable.

</PRE></OL>This is an indication that the selected program does not support
the scripting of Apple Events.
<P>
If you do not load the AppleScript extension, you will receive the
following message:
<P>
<PRE>   Could not read the dictionary of the program or extension
   because I can't connect to the scripting system. Make sure it was
   installed correctly.
