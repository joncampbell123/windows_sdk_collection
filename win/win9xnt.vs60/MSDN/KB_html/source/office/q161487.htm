</PRE><h2>CONTENTS OF THE NETWORK INSTALLATION WIZARD RELEASE NOTES FILE</h2>
 
<P>
Section 1
<P>
Introduction
<P>
Understand the motivation behind the 2.0 version of the network
Installation Wizard.
<P>
The 1.0 version of the Network Installation Wizard (NIW) was introduced
with the original version of the Office Resource Kit for Office 95. Its
goals included helping to lower the threshold for rolling out Office in a
corporate environment by facilitating the creation of custom installation
scripts. Given the feedback we've received since Office 95 made its debut,
NIW 1.0 has been a success. However, from an implementation and support
perspective we soon discovered our burden for NIW 1.0 was quite high. So
the primary motivation for embarking on a new version of NIW was to reduce
this burden.
<P>
In addition to reducing our support burden, we also had the advantage of
feedback from corporate sites on how they use the 1.0 version of NIW and
how they would like to use it. Combining a reduced support burden with
corporate feedback and new functionality in our installation tools for
Office 97 we came up with a short list of requirements for the 2.0 version.
The list includes:

<UL><LI>Performance Improvements

<LI>Generalization

<LI>Wizard User Interface

<LI>New Features
<P>
</UL>Performance Improvements
<P>
One of the most common complaints about the 1.0 version of NIW was how long
it took reading Office's Setup Table File (STF). So, we began the 2.0
effort by profiling the 1.0 version to determine where the bottlenecks
were. This effort pointed to a couple of areas for improvement: converting
the code base from 16-bit to 32-bit and abandoning ODBC processing of the
STF in favor of an in-memory model.
<P>
Converting the code base from 16-bit to 32-bit improved the fault tolerance
of NIW 2.0 and allowed us to take advantage of newer 32-bit versions of
system services. Although we did not gain a significant performance
improvement solely from the port to 32-bit, the gain in stability and
marginal performance increase were worth this effort.
<P>
In the 1.0 version of NIW the STF was read into a temporary Microsoft
Access database first, then processing was carried out through ODBC calls
with the resulting records being processed using string manipulation
routines. Our profiling determined the ODBC calls were a bottleneck as well
as the string manipulation routines we were using. So this approach was
abandoned. Instead, a support module (i.e., STFTOOL.DLL) was created which
utilized an in memory model for the STF so that fetching records and
processing fields within those records could all be done in memory. An
enormous performance advantage was gained as a result of this modification.
For our reference machine of a 486/33 with 8 Mb of RAM, we cut the time
required to read Microsoft Office 95 Professional's STF from 26 minutes to
33 seconds.
<P>
Generalization
<P>
Part of the reason our support burden for the 1.0 version of NIW was so
high was due to its many dependencies on the specific form of Office 95
Professional's STF. Although coding NIW 1.0 to specifics of an STF provided
the ability to customize settings specific to Microsoft Office, nearly
every change to the STF broke NIW. 1.0 This became painfully evident for
the Microsoft Office 95 Standard release as well as each of the upgrades.
Plus, the 1.0 version of NIW was unable to customize foreign language
versions of Microsoft Office.
<P>
As a result, one of the criteria for the 2.0 version was to generalize the
code so that it could be backwards compatible to Microsoft Office 95 STFs
as well as forward compatible. The cost to administrators, however, is the
loss of customizations specific to Microsoft Office like the ability to
minimize the Fast Find footprint. But we feel the benefit of being able to
customize a variety of STFs outweighs the loss of a few specific Microsoft
Office customizations.
<P>
Wizard User Interface
<P>
In version 1.0 of NIW, the flow through the user interface was rather
circuitous. Several instances of returning to the same dialog to choose
another path existed.  To remedy this, and to cast the user interface into
a form made familiar by Windows 95 and now Windows NT 4.0, we flattened out
the flow into a wizard.  One of the obvious benefits is that a
administrator can revisit any of the dialogs in the wizard as many times as
they want before actually committing their customizations to file. In
addition, flattening out the flow simplifies the interface considerably.
<P>
New Features
<P>
New functionality in the Windows 95 and in our installation technology has
provided two opportunities for enhancements in the 2.0 version of NIW: the
Personal special folder in the operating system and installation logs.
<P>
Documents Folder
<P>
Special folders are a collection of registry entries endowed with unique
properties that are used to maintain user profiles. One of these unique
properties is the ability to move the folder anywhere and the system
continues to track it.  Examples of special folders include Desktop,
NetHood, Recent, SendTo, and Start Menu.
<P>
In Microsoft Office 95, we decided to use one of these special folders,
specifically the Personal folder, to implement a single location where all
Microsoft Office applications open and save to by default. Doing so would
save end users all kinds of grief surrounding organizing and locating data.
We named this folder "C:\My Documents." While the reasoning for this
feature was sound, we neglected to provide an easy way for corporations to
change this location. So the 2.0 version of NIW fills this hole.
<P>
While running NIW 2.0, you have the opportunity to set the documents folder
for all end users installing using your customized STF.  However, there is
a caveat. If the Personal special folder has already been defined on an end
user's machine prior to installing using your customized STF, your changes
will not apply. In other words, the value of the Personal special folder
registry value is preserved.
<P>
Installation Log
<P>
Built into the version of our installation logic used to install Office 97
is the ability to create a post administration install log. This log is a
tab delimited text file whose name and location you specify and which gets
written to each time an end user performs a post administration operation.
Each record in this log file contains the following fields:
<P>
<PRE>   Field          Description
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Date           Date the operation was performed in the form: YYYY-MM-DD.

   Time           Time the operation was performed in the form: HH:MM:SS.

   User           User name of the logged in user at the time the operation
                  was performed.

   Machine        Name of the machine onto which the operation was
                  performed.

   Application    Name of the application being installed, taken from the
                  AppName field in the header section of the STF.

   Version        Version of the product being installed, taken from the
                  AppVersion field in the header section of the STF.

   Operation      Operation being performed (e.g., Install, Remove All)

</PRE>Because this feature is only supported in the latest version of our
installation technology used with Microsoft Office 97, you cannot create an
installation log with previous versions of STFs. The dialog in NIW 2.0 for
specifying an installation log is not displayed.
<P>
Section 2
<P>
Compatibility
<P>
The 2.0 version of NIW can work with other versions of Office's STF as well
as other product's STFs altogether.
<P>
One of the requirements for the 2.0 version of NIW was to reduce the
support burden, which maps directly to generalizing its behavior.
Consequently, the 2.0 version provides a quantum leap in compatibility over
the 1.0 version. Not only will the 2.0 version of NIW allow you to
customize the Microsoft Office 97 Professional STF, but also the various
flavors of Microsoft Office 95 (i.e., Professional, Standard, "a" and "b"
releases, etc.)  Plus going forward, the 2.0 version will work with other
Microsoft Office 97 versions like Standard and any bundles or upgrade
releases we might make.
<P>
Although there are no plans to localize the 2.0 version of NIW itself, it
is capable of customizing foreign language STFs as long as they are single
byte character languages.  Results with double byte character languages are
unpredictable and are therefore not recommended.
<P>
Section 3
<P>
Program Manager Items Versus Shortcuts
<P>
What is the difference between the Program Manager Items dialog and the
Shortcuts dialog?.
<P>
One possible source of confusion involves the difference between the
Program Manager Items dialog and the Shortcuts dialog. Both dialogs must be
present for backwards compatibility since Microsoft Office 97 can be
installed on Windows 95, Windows NT 3.51 and Windows NT 4.0. But the
difference between data on the two dialogs is rooted in how STFs are
authored.
<P>
Before the Windows 95 shell existed there was only the Program Manager.
Creating icons in the Program Manager was accomplished by using an install
action called AddProgmanItem.  This action used DDE to send the necessary
commands to Program Manager to create the desired icon in the desired
window.  An additional flavor of the action also existed and is called
AddProgmanItemQuiet, the only difference being the absence of a dialog to
allow end users the ability to change the Program Manager window into which
the icon is to be created. Both of these actions continue to exist today.
<P>
When authoring an installation for Windows NT 3.51, the AddProgmanItem
action is used. However, when authoring an installation for Windows 95 or
Windows NT 4.0 this action cannot always be used because of the inability
of AddProgmanItem to create icons directly on the Start menu, or even on
the Programs menu below the Start menu.  Instead, a different action called
InstallShortcut must be used to create shortcuts in these folders. So, to
support products that install on a Windows 3.x style interface as well as a
Windows 95 style interface, the 2.0 version of NIW provides dialogs for
handling both.
<P>
Program Manager Items Dialog
<P>
The Program Manager Items dialog contains all AddProgmanItem and
AddProgmanItemQuiet actions in the STF, regardless of whether Typical,
Custom, or Run from Network Server was chosen on the Installation Type
dialog.  By default, all of the Program Manager items are checked
indicating they will be installed.  If there are no AddProgmanItem or
AddProgmanItemQuiet actions in the STF, the dialog is skipped.
<P>
The advantage of showing all such actions regardless of the installation
type is to avoid requiring that administrators visit each installation type
explicitly.  Instead, decisions can be made for all possible paths by
visiting the Program Manager Items dialog only once.
<P>
Shortcuts Dialog
<P>
The Shortcuts dialog, in turn, contains all InstallShortcut actions in the
STF, regardless of whether Typical, Custom, or Run from Network Server was
chosen on the Installation Type dialog.  The same rules govern this dialog
as govern the Program Manager Items dialog, namely: all of the shortcuts
are checked on for installation by default and if there are no
InstallShortcut actions in the STF the dialog is skipped.
<P>
Section 4
<P>
Shortcuts
<P>
While NIW 2.0 supports organizing the shortcuts that are created on end
users' machines, there are some limitations.
<P>
Shortcuts on or below the Start menu are difficult to author in the STF
because the location of these folders changes per user.  Finding the
correct folder location depends on a custom action which retrieves the
location from the registry. Then the InstallShortcut action depends on the
result of the custom action to determine where to place the shortcut.  For
this reason, as well as some of the subtle order dependencies among lines
in an STF, adding new folders to the list of possible folders into which
shortcuts can be installed is not supported. However, whether or not
shortcuts get installed can be changed and where shortcuts get installed
can be changed among the available folders.
<P>
Installing/Not Installing Shortcuts
<P>
The Shortcuts dialog contains all InstallShortcut actions in the STF,
regardless of whether Typical, Custom, or Run from Network Server was
chosen on the Installation Type dialog.  By default, all of the shortcuts
are checked indicating they will be installed.  To remove a shortcut from
being installed, simply uncheck the shortcut form the list.
<P>
Changing Shortcut Folder
<P>
As indicated earlier, shortcuts created on the Start menu or any of its sub-
menus require an InstallShortcut action that references a different custom
action, which returns the location of the folder for the menu. Naturally,
more than one InstallShortcut action might reference a single custom action
because they are being installed into the same location.  The way the
location of an installed shortcut is changed, however, is by changing the
folder for which the custom action is looking.  Therefore, if one of the
shortcuts being installed into, say, the Programs menu under Start is
changed to the Start menu itself, then all shortcuts that were being
installed to the Programs menu get moved to the Start menu. And the reason
they all get moved is because the custom action they all reference got
changed from Programs to Start menu. Keep in mind, however, there is no
easy way to tell in the Shortcuts dialog which shortcuts reference the same
custom action and which do not without actually moving shortcuts.
<P>
Section 5
<P>
Duplicate Items
<P>
Several dialogs in NIW 2.0 contain duplicate entries that differ only in
their ObjID. What is an ObjID and why do these duplicates occur?.
<P>
An STF contains a header section followed by a collection of rows, each row
uniquely identified by its object identifier, or ObjID.  These ObjIDs are
used to determine order as well as for specifying rows anywhere that rows
need to be referenced.
<P>
Since ObjIDs are unique, they are being used on several NIW 2.0 dialogs to
help in identifying duplicate items.  The dialogs in question are the
Yes/No Questions, Program Manager Items, and Shortcuts dialogs. Duplicate
items appear in these dialogs for two reasons:
<P>
Install time branching logic in the STF cannot be resolved at the time NIW
2.0 is running
<P>
The install mode tree is not built when populating these dialogs.
<P>
Branching Logic
<P>
Throughout an STF are branches in the installation logic that get evaluated
at install time, depending on conditions arising on a particular end user's
machine.  Since the machine upon which NIW 2.0 is running does not
necessarily reflect end user machines, we must present both sides of these
logic branches.  Customizations must be made for both branches to cover all
possible end users installing from the modified STF.
<P>
Install Modes
<P>
When an end user performs a standalone install of Microsoft Office, one of
several options can be chosen.  These options typically include Typical,
Compact, Custom, and Run From CD.  Each of these choices represents a
possible install mode and, consequently, a different path through the STF.
When populating the Yes/No Questions, Program Manager Items, and Shortcuts
dialogs, NIW 2.0 ignores these different install mode paths.  Instead, the
entire STF is processed from beginning to end.  As a result, duplicate
items are likely to appear in these dialogs because they reside in
different install paths.  To help administrators differentiate between
duplicate items an ObjID column is provided. Generally speaking, you need
to apply customizations to all items appearing in these dialogs to cover
all possible circumstances.  However, with enough familiarity of the STF
format, these ObjIDs can be used to understand exactly the differences
between items in these three dialogs.
<P>
Section 6
<P>
Orphaned Lines
<P>
Some products' STFs contain orphaned lines, lines that never get called.
Why do these exist and how do they affect NIW 2.0?.
<P>
Another possible source of confusion is the existence of orphaned lines in
a product's STF. Though uncommon, the possibility does exist for orphaned
lines to exist in an STF because the risk of removing them late in a
product cycle outweighs any benefit gained by removing them.  The three
dialogs that are populated by processing the entire STF, rather than
following a particular install mode path, display orphaned lines.  The
affected dialogs are Yes/No Questions, Program Manager Items, and
Shortcuts.
<P>
There is no adverse affect to customizing orphaned lines from an
installation perspective since they never get executed. However, they are a
nuisance for administrators since they represent additional customizations
that won't really affect end users.  But since there is no easy way for an
administrator using NIW 2.0 to determine which items in these dialogs are
orphaned, they must be treated as if they are valid entries.  The only time
any confusion would occur is if an administrator expected to see some
behavior change they made in NIW 2.0 and didn't, the problem might be an
orphaned line.
<P>
Section 7
<P>
Long and Short Filenames
<P>
Either long or short file names are shown on NIW 2.0's main dialogs, never
both.  How does this affect what gets written to the STF?
<P>
By default, NIW 2.0 displays paths and file names in long file name format
under the assumption that most administrators and their users are running a
long file name capable operating system.  In situations where assuming long
file name support is invalid, administrators can change what NIW 2.0
displays using the "Return long folder name to previous dialog" check box.
Regardless of what is displayed, however, NIW 2.0 always writes both long
and short file names to the STF when necessary.
<P>
Changing Paths Directly
<P>
Several dialogs in NIW 2.0 present locations of folders and allow
administrators to change them. The list of dialogs includes:

<UL><LI>Primary Location

<LI>Documents Folder

<LI>Components

<LI>Program Manager Items

<LI>Add Files
<P>
</UL>On each of these dialogs a field is provided that contains the default
location of the folder, taken from the STF.  Because both long and short
names typically reside in the STF, the name that gets displayed is
determined by the state of the "Return long folder name to previous dialog"
check box on the Browse dialog. When checked, the default state, the long
name is taken from the STF and displayed. Otherwise, the short name is
taken and displayed.  When a change is made, however, both long and short
names must be written back to the STF. If a long name is entered and the
STF expects both long and short names, then a short name is generated from
the long one.  If a short name is entered and both are required, the short
name is used for both the long and short name values in the STF.
<P>
Using the Browse Dialog
<P>
NIW 2.0 typically runs on an administrator's machine which may or may not
be configured the same as an end user machine. Despite this fact, the
Browse dialog provides additional benefit in the following ways:

<UL><LI>If the exact location is not known, browsing allows administrators to
 determine the location without leaving NIW 2.0.

<LI>Specifying the location of folders using the Browse dialog guarantees
 well formed paths.

<LI>Folder locations can be specified relative to special path properties
 using the Browse dialog.
<P>
</UL>Section 8
<P>
Known Issues
<P>
Following is a list of known issues with the 2.0 version of the Network
Installation Wizard.
<P>
No product is perfect when it ships. In fact, retail software products
would never ship if perfection were a requirement. Instead, software
products are shipped when the benefit of shipping outweighs the risk of any
remaining known issues. Below is a list of such known low risk issues.  If
you find additional issues that do not appear on the list below, please
take the time to notify Microsoft so that your issues can get addressed in
subsequent versions.
<P>
Running Batch Mode Installations
<P>
Customizing an installation using NIW 2.0, then performing the installation
interactively, may not behave as expected.  NIW 2.0 operates on the Batch
mode column in an STF which is processed when the /b command line parameter
is used with SETUP.EXE. Running an installation interactively processes
which ever path is chosen on the AppMainDlg (e.g., Typical, Compact,
Complete, Run From Network).
<P>
No Field in the STF May Exceed 255 Chars
<P>
Although NIW 2.0 offers data validation in some places, for the most part
administrators are free to enter data that can cause SETUP.EXE to behave
poorly.  Always save a back up copy of the STF before modifying it with NIW
2.0, and be careful when entering data directly into any NIW 2.0 fields.
<P>
Collapsing Sub-tree On Components Dialog Fails To Update Description
<P>
When expanding and collapsing component sub-trees on the Components dialog
it is occasionally possible to get the description out of sync with the
currently selected component. Simply selecting a component in the tree pane
will properly reset the description.
<P>
No Leading "\" When Adding Registry Keys
<P>
When specifying a registry key on the Add Registry Entry dialog, do not
precede the name of the key with a backslash ("\"). For example, specifying
the CurrentVersion key in the registry is accomplished using the following
syntax:
<P>
<PRE>   Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion

</PRE>No preceding backslash was specified. Failing to follow this rule will not
cause an error in NIW 2.0 but will cause an error when a user attempts to
install using the customized STF.
<P>
No Validation That Registry Value Data and Data Type Are In Sync
<P>
To add a registry entry in NIW 2.0 an administrator must provide the
registry root, the data type for the value, the key, the value name, the
actual data for the value, and an optional description. The data type for
the value data is chosen from a combo box.  NIW 2.0 makes no attempt to
verify that the value data an administrator enters is of the same data type
as indicated in the data type combo box. If value data and its data type
clash, the problem will not present itself until a user attempts to install
using the customized STF or when the application being installed is
actually run.
<P>
State Of "Return long folder name to previous dialog" Check Box Affects All
Dialogs
<P>
Changing the state of this check box on the Browse dialog determines
whether to display paths using long or short file name syntax for all
dialogs in NIW 2.0.
<P>
Up/Down Arrows Toggle Check Boxes
<P>
Several NIW 2.0 dialogs contain lists of items that can be checked or not.
In some cases, scrolling through items in these lists using the up and down
arrow keys can cause check boxes to change their state from checked to
unchecked, or vise versa.
<P>
Working Folder Field Sometimes Blank, Sometimes &lt;NoneSpecified&gt;
<P>
Several of the dialogs in NIW 2.0 contain a working folder field. There is
an implicit assumption made that when the working folder field is blank in
the STF, the working folder is either optional or is inherited from its
parent. Either way, NIW 2.0 does not always handle empty working folders
consistently: some are actually blank and some contain a property called
&lt;NoneSpecified&gt;.  Both are equivalent.
<P>
Only Admin. STFs Are Supported
<P>
NIW 2.0 can be used to open and modify a floppy mode STF, but using NIW 2.0
in this manner has not been tested nor is it supported.
<P>
Progress Indicator Goes To Extreme Upper Left Corner On NT 3.51
<P>
In some situations on Windows NT 3.51, the progress indicator is displayed
in the upper left corner of the screen. Functionality is not affected by
this peculiarity.
<P>
Working Directory On Shortcuts Dialog
<P>
Working directories are typically not provided when authoring the
InstallShortcut action.  The reason for this is simple: shortcuts without a
working directory have an assumed working directory - the directory in
which the shortcut file (i.e., *.LNK) resides. Therefore, reading a long
and short name version of a working directory from the STF is not possible.
So, when specifying a working directory for a shortcut that is different
from the default, you should use the Browse dialog along with the "Return
long folder name to previous dialog" check box.  Only one working directory
is entered, long or short, depending upon the state of the check box.  To
enter a long name formatted working directory, enter it in the Long name
field and make certain the check box is checked.  For a short name
formatted working directory, enter it into the Short name field and uncheck
the check box.
