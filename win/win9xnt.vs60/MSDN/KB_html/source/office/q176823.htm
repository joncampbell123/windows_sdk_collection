</PRE></OL><h3>Known Issues</h3>
 
<P>
Shared Files Are Removed:
<P>
This utility removes shared system files that are installed 
by Microsoft Office 97. Because a shared file may be used by 
another program, other programs may not run correctly if a 
necessary shared file has been removed. If this problem 
occurs, reinstall the program to replace the required shared
file.
<P>
Messages Appear Under Windows NT 4.0: 
<P>
If your operating system is Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, when
you run this utility and run Microsoft Internet Explorer 
4.0, the following error message may appear:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Internet Explorer

   This page provides potentially unsafe information to an
   ActiveX Control. Your current security settings prohibit
   running controls in this manner. As a result, this page 
   may not display correctly.

</PRE>In addition, when you click one of the drives in My Computer
or in Microsoft Windows Explorer, the following error message 
may appear:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Internet Explorer

   An ActiveX Control on this page is not safe.  Your current
   security settings prohibit running controls on this page. 
   As a result, this page may not display as intended.

</PRE>When you click OK, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Internet Explorer Script Error

   An error has occurred in the script on this page.

   Line:  78
   Char:   1

   Error: Object doesn't support this property or method.
   Code:  0

   Do you want to continue running scripts on this page?

</PRE>When you click either Yes or No, you can open any of the 
drives. However, when you open folders on the drives, 
similar error messages continue to appear.
<P>
NOTE: These error messages appear again whenever you 
restart your computer. Because this utility removes shared 
system components, the Microsoft Internet Explorer Active 
Desktop doesn't work properly. 
<P>
To correct these errors, reinstall Microsoft Internet 
Explorer 4.0.
<P>
For information about this problem with Microsoft Windows
NT 4.0 and Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0, see the 
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base on the 
World Wide Web:

</PRE><h3>Using the Office 97 File and Registry Eraser Utility</h3>

registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to 
do this, view the "Restoring the Registry" Help topic in 
Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry  Key" Help topic in 
Regedt32.exe.
<P>
Using the utility incorrectly may cause serious problems that

Registry Eraser Utility at your own risk.

<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Office Upgrade Wizard

   Running the Microsoft Office Upgrade Wizard in Aggressive
   mode may remove some of the Microsoft Office 97 files and
   render it useless.
   Do you want to continue with an Aggressive Cleanup?

</PRE>To continue running the utility, click Yes. If you click No, the
utility does not completely remove the files.
<P>
