</PRE>_________________________________________________
<P>
[Setup - General]
<P>
Microsoft Office for Windows 95 requires Windows 95 (or later) or Windows
NT 3.51 (or later) releases.
<P>
All of the applications in Microsoft Office for Windows 95 Standard and
Microsoft Office for Windows 95 Professional are version 7.0.
<P>
[Setup on Windows 95 (or later)]
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office for Windows 95, the Setup program for
Office will not be installed on your hard disk drive.
<P>
New shared components of Office for Windows 95 will be installed in the
folder \Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared. However, if you
already have some installed shared components, the Setup program will leave
the old files in the \Windows\Msapps folder, and install the Office 95
shared files to the new location.
<P>
If you uninstall Office for Windows 95, the MSOffice folder, which may
contain templates or documents that you modified, is not deleted. If you
want to reinstall Office later and preserve these files in a separate
folder, you will need to create a new folder and copy those files to the
new location. Simply renaming the old folder can cause Windows to associate
the two folder names, which may lead to some confusion for the new Office
installation.
<P>
Microsoft Office Fast Start is automatically loaded into the Windows 95
Startup folder when you install Office for Windows 95. This utility
increases the overall performance of the Office applications. It loads the
OLE DLLs at the start up of Windows 95. Once loaded, these DLLs remain in
memory for the entire Windows session. Fast Start cuts time off the
following scenarios: launching Office applications, opening Office
documents, saving Office documents; using the Copy and Paste commands
between applications, and printing. Selecting the icon that appears on the
Windows 95 Start Up folder for Fast Start will not bring up a user
interface.
<P>
[Customizing Your Windows 95 Start Menu]
<P>
If you install Office for Windows 95 over Office 4.x, you will want to
delete the Start menu shortcuts from Office 4.x. To do this:

<UL><LI>Right click the Start button.
<LI>Click Explore on pop-up menu.
<LI>Open the folder containing the shortcuts you want to delete or move.
   These shortcuts are located in \&lt;Windows&gt;\Start Menu or a subdirectory
   were &lt;Windows&gt; is your Windows 95 directory.
<LI>Select the shortcut icon(s) you want to delete and drag them to the
   Recycle Bin.
<P>
</UL>This will not delete the applications, only the shortcuts.
<P>
[Features No Longer Available in the Typical Installation]
<P>
To install the following features:

<UL><LI>GIF file converter
<LI>Grammar Checker (was in Typical)
<LI>Organization Chart (was in Typical)
<LI>Clip Art Gallery is now 1MB. For the complete gallery of graphics
   images, use the Office for Windows 95 CD.
<LI>Some templates
<P>
</UL>Run Office for Windows 95 Setup and do the following steps:

<UL><LI>Select Custom from the Setup Options dialog box.
<LI>Select Converters, Filters, And Data Access from the Custom dialog box.
<LI>Click Change Option...
<LI>Click Graphics Filters from the Converters, Filters, And Data Access
   dialog box.
<LI>Click Change Option...
<LI>Select CompuServe GIF format (and any other desired options)
<LI>Click OK to return to the Converters, Filters, And Data Access dialog
   box.
<LI>Click OK to return to the Custom dialog box.
<LI>Click Continue to continue installation.
<P>
</UL>Note: All the OLE servers and clip art are available to users who upgraded
and who installed over the existing MSOFFICE directory.
<P>
[Upgrading over Office 94]
<P>
If you are using Office 94, it is easy to upgrade to Office 95. To save
space on your hard disk drive, you should uninstall Office 4.x before
installing Office 95.
<P>
[Setup on Windows NT 3.51 (or later)]
<P>
If you are installing on Windows NT 3.51, you will need to obtain an
updated version of an NT 3.51 system file named WINSRV.DLL. This file will
be contained in Service Pack 1 for NT 3.51. The Service Pack will also
address some issues with the Help on Windows NT 3.51 and contain other
enhancements. Once the Service Pack is available, NT 3.51 users will be
able to access it the following way: This file can be obtained by
<P>
For Internet Access:
<P>
<PRE> ftp ftp.microsoft.com
 logon anonymous
 cd bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/nt351
 bin
 get &lt;Latest Service Pack for NT 3.51&gt;

</PRE>If you are running a dual boot system with Windows NT 3.51 and Windows 95,
you must install Office 95 twice, once for each system.
<P>
If you install Office 95 in one language version on Windows NT  3.51 in
another language version, Office 95 setup will not be able to detect the
startup files. It will create a new startup group named in the language of
the Office 95 version. Therefore, the startup files installed in this group
will not launch automatically.
<P>
Installing Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, PowerPoint for Windows 95, or
Microsoft Project for Windows 95 on a machine running Microsoft Excel 5.0
for Windows NT (not 16-bit Excel 5) will corrupt the previously installed
version of Microsoft Excel 5.0 for Windows NT because some files used by
Microsoft Excel 5.0 will be updated when installing Office 95.
<P>
[Using Disks with Distribution Media Format (DMF)]
<P>
With the exception of the Setup disk (Disk 1), your Microsoft Office disks
use a new format called DMF (Distribution Media Format). DMF increases the
capacity of a 3.5-inch floppy disk, which reduces the number of disks
needed to install your application and speeds up installation.
<P>
Because DMF is a new format, many existing utilities such as Norton Disk
Doctor, Microsoft ScanDisk, MS-DOS DiskCopy, and Microsoft Windows Copy
Disk do not recognize DMF. You should NOT use disk utilities to examine a
DMF formatted disk, as these utilities can corrupt the DMF disk. You cannot
copy DMF formatted disks using MS-DOS DiskCopy or Microsoft Windows Copy
Disk ( If you want to copy files from the Setup disks, see "Extracting
Files from DMF Disks," later in this file.).
<P>
Windows 95, Windows 3.1 (or later), and Windows NT 3.5 (or later) support
DMF.
<P>
If there is a chance that your system has a virus, you should run a
recently updated virus detection utility such as F-prot before installing
Microsoft Office for Windows 95. Otherwise Disk 2 and higher may become
infected with the virus.
<P>
Extracting Files from DMF Disks
<P>
If you need to copy the Microsoft Office disks onto a network server or
other permanent storage drive, you may use the copy switch (/C) with the
EXTRACT.EXE utility on Disk 1 to copy the Microsoft Office installation
files to the target location.
<P>
For example, after creating a directory called C:\DISKS on your hard disk
drive for the Microsoft Office files, copy all the files on Disk 1 to that
directory. (Since Disk 1 does not use DMF, you can use the standard MS-DOS
Copy command, COPY A:\*.* C:\DISKS.) Switch to drive A and type the
following command to copy the rest of the disks to the directory C:\DISKS:
<P>
<PRE>   FOR %I IN (*.*) DO C:\DISKS\EXTRACT /C A:\%I C:\DISKS\%I

</PRE>A cabinet (.CAB) file includes many files stored as a single file. If you
need only a single file that is contained in one of the cabinet files, you
may search for it using the /D switch with EXTRACT.EXE. Once you find the
file, you can use EXTRACT.EXE again to copy the file to the desired
location. You can also type EXTRACT /? to get help on the EXTRACT command
options. Here are some examples of how to use the EXTRACT command to find
files.
<P>
To list all files in a cabinet file:
<P>
<PRE>   EXTRACT /D A:\&lt;cabinet filename&gt;

</PRE>To list all EXE files in a cabinet file:
<P>
<PRE>   EXTRACT /D A:\&lt;cabinet filename&gt; *.EXE

</PRE>Here are some examples of how to use EXTRACT to copy a single file out of a
cabinet file.
<P>
To extract ANY.EXE to the current directory:
<P>
<PRE>   EXTRACT A:\&lt;cabinet filename&gt; ANY.EXE

</PRE>To extract ANY.EXE to C:\OFFICE:
<P>
<PRE>   EXTRACT A:\&lt;cabinet filename&gt; /L C:\OFFICE ANY.EXE

</PRE>[Updates to Getting Results with Microsoft Office for Windows 95, standard
version]
<P>
For errata in Getting Results with Microsoft Office for Windows 95 on
specific applications, see the readme.txt in the application's folder.
<P>
Graphics filters licensed from Henderson Software, Inc., are not part of
the product and should not be on the copyright page.
<P>
The Btrieve driver, Btrieve Technologies, Inc., is not part of the product
and should not be on the copyright page.
<P>
Pages 27 and 29: The correct online location of the Network Install Readme
is in the Getting Help section of the application's online Help table of
contents.
<P>
Page 28: The name of the Remove button has been changed to the Add/Remove
button. Therefore, step 5 should read, "Click the Office application, and
click the Add/Remove button.
<P>
Page 29: The list of Readme files in the Office folder should include
BINDER.TXT.
<P>
Page 29: The correct procedure for starting an Office application is "Click
the Start button, click Programs, and then click the application you want.
<P>
Adding Microsoft Network Shortcuts
<P>
You can add any MSN shortcuts to the Microsoft Network shortcut list,
available from the Help menu of each Office application, by simply moving
or copying the shortcuts to the Office95\Office\MSN folder.
<P>
[Windows NT and Office 95]
<P>
In both Windows NT 3.51 and Windows 95, you can right click on a filename
in the File Open dialog box for all Office applications to get a shortcut
menu. However, when running on Windows NT the shortcut menu does not have
the Copy and Delete commands.
<P>
When running from the network on Windows NT, the Office Shortcut Bar will
not display the correct icons. This means that the default buttons "Make an
Appointment," "Add a Task," and "Add a Contact," as well as the
applications, will have generic icons. They will, however, work correctly.
<P>
[Using Help on Windows NT 3.51 Without Service Pack 1]
<P>
If the Answer Wizard is launched from the Help menu when a Help topic or
Help dialog is open, Help may not function.
<P>
When you are working in a Visual Basic Module in Microsoft Excel, you may
not be able to use context sensitive Help. To use Help in a module, use the
Answer Wizard or the online Help index.
<P>
[Removing Earlier Office Version's Help Files From Path statement]
<P>
On a machine with both Office 95 and a previous version of Office, Office
95 may load the previous version's Help files. To correct this, edit the
Path statement in AUTOEXEC.BAT to remove the reference to the previous
version's directory location.
<P>
[Location of Templates for Binder in Office 95 Setup for International
Users]
<P>
The following Binder templates that have the page settings set to A4 paper
size are located in the Value Pack rather than in the Typical installation:
Client Billing, Meeting Organizer, Proposal and Marketing Plan, and Report.
<P>
[Lotus cc:Mail or Lotus Notes]
<P>
Microsoft Office supports Vendor Independent Messaging (VIM) 1.0, which
means that you can use the Send and Add/Edit Routing Slip commands (File
menu) in Microsoft Office to send or route Microsoft Office documents with
mail applications such as Lotus cc:Mail that support VIM 1.0.  Lotus
cc:Mail 1.11 users may get VIM support files from Lotus. In order for
Microsoft Office to use VIM mail applications the DOS PATH command in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file must include the directory in which the mail
application's VIM support files are stored.  If the PATH does not include
the directory containing the VIM support files then setup will not install
VIM support for Microsoft Office and Microsoft Office will not function
correctly when sending mail.  The Microsoft Office support files for VIM
1.0 are called MAPIVI32.DLL and MAPIVITK.DLL, and both are installed in the
System subdirectory of the Windows program directory.
<P>
There are known problems with Lotus Notes 3.3 TCP/IP network protocol
support which are being addressed in a future version of Lotus Notes. These
problems will prevent Microsoft Office from sending mail through the
current versions of 16 bit Lotus Notes when Lotus Notes is using TCP/IP as
its network protocol.  Using a protocol other than TCP/IP solves the
problem.
<P>
[Running Microsoft Office from the CD-ROM]
<P>
Installing Microsoft Office with the "Run from CD-ROM" option takes about
30MB of hard disk drive space.  To reduce the size, you can remove one of
the following components if you don't need it:
Datamaps, located on Program Files\Microsoft Shared\Datamaps folder.
OLE servers located in the Program Files\Common Files folder.
<P>
For the best performance, it is recommended that a drive with 2x or higher
speed is used.
<P>
[Percentage Use of Hard Disk Drive and Size Requirements for Installation
Options]
<P>

 Total   93,162  100%

</PRE>[Running Access 2.0 With Office 95 Standard]
<P>
If you are installing Office Standard for Windows 95 on a system where you
need to run Access 2.0, Office for Windows 95 and Access 2.0 can coexist on
the same system.
<P>
[Handling Energy Star Monitor Problems While Running on a Network]
<P>
Due to occasional problems with some Energy Star monitors, it is
recommended that you turn off Advanced Power management while running a
network installation. To turn off these settings, open the Windows Control
Panel, open the Power icon, and select Off in the Power Management control.
<P>
[Error Message Removing the Office CD During Setup]
<P>
If during Setup you remove the Office CD from the CD-Rom drive for any
reason, you will see a system message. To continue Setup, re-insert the
Office CD, press ENTER, and close the Autorun dialog box.
