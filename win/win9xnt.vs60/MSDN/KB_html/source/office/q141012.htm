The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Find Fast does not index password-protected documents.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Because password-protected documents are encrypted, they cannot be
indexed. Find Fast does not index password-protected documents because
they are not searchable files. Any references to file properties or
content will not be addressed in the index
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior in Find Fast is by design to uphold the security and
protection of your documents.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Indexes are used to make file searches faster in Office programs. If the
password-protected file is searched based on either "File name" or "Files
of type" it will appear in the Open dialog box following the normal
search criteria. However, searches for password-protected documents based
on content or other properties internal to that file will not appear in
the Open dialog box.
<P>
If an index finds a password-protected document, an entry is made in the
Indexer log, Ffastlog.txt. When Find Fast updates an index, it logs
events and errors in the log file Ffastlog.txt.
<P>
To view the indexer log file, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Click the Start button on the Windows 95 taskbar, point to Settings,
   and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>With the left mouse button, double-click the Find Fast icon.

<P><LI>On the Index menu, click Show Indexer Log.
<P>
</OL>The Office Setup program installs Find Fast in the Windows 95 Startup
folder so that all Office documents are indexed automatically at system
startup and periodically at two-hour intervals. Find Fast must be able to
gain access to document contents to successfully complete the indexing
process.
<P>
The index includes information about document content and properties.
Indexes are built according to file types and selected drives and
folders. An index can cover the entire root directory, or smaller indexes
can be configured to include certain folders. You can create as many
indexes as you want as long as corresponding folders do not overlap.
<P>
Indexes use internal filters in the Office products to parse the files
with the Office extensions (.doc, .dot, .xl*, .ppt, .pot, .obd, .obt,
.mpp, .mpw, .mpt, .mpx). If Find Fast finds a format that is not an
Office format, it queries the Windows 95 Registry to determine if any
external converters are installed.
