The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office Setup program in maintenance mode, and
you click the Remove All button, some of the Office files are not removed
from your computer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Office Setup. Setup does not remove
any files that may be used by other applications. To completely remove
Microsoft Office, you must remove all of the files listed below. However,
because some of the files may be shared you may need to reinstall other
applications. In general, the following items are removed by Office Setup
when you use the Remove All feature:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Office folder is removed, unless you have saved any
   personal files to folders inside the Microsoft Office folder. (Setup
   will not remove any of your personal data files.)

<LI>The Common Files folder (in the Program Files folder) is removed.

<LI>All files installed by Office Setup to the Microsoft Windows folder are
   removed.

<LI>Most of the Office entries in the Windows Registry are removed.
<P>
</UL>Setup does not remove files installed by Office to the Windows\System
folder (where Windows is the folder to which you installed Microsoft
Windows)
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following is a list of files installed by Office to the \Windows\System
folder that are not removed by Setup:

</PRE>NOTE: If you install Microsoft Excel for Windows NT after performing a
"Remove All" maintenance mode installation of Microsoft Office version 7.0,
you receive the following error message when you run Microsoft Excel:
<P>
<PRE>   An error occurred initializing the VBA libraries (-25346)

</PRE>This error message occurs because the Office Setup program does not remove
all of the .DLL files installed by Office, and these .DLL files are not
compatible with Microsoft Excel for Windows NT.
<P>
