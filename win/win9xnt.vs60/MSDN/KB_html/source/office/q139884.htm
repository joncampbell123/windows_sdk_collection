The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office Professional for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Office Standard for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup program in Microsoft Office Professional for Windows
95 over an existing workstation installation of Microsoft Office Standard
for Windows 95, you may receive the following error messages:

<UL><LI>"Setup tried to create an invalid path using &lt;folder name&gt; and
<P><PRE>    &lt;file name&gt;."
</PRE><P>
   The only option is to click OK. If you click OK, the Setup program will
   continue.

<LI>"Setup could not write to the file: &lt;folder name&gt;&lt;file name&gt; This file
   is currently being used by another application. Close any open
   applications."
<P>
   Your options are to click Abort, Retry, or Ignore. If you click Abort, a
   message appears asking if you would like to quit Setup. If you click
   Retry, the error message reappears. If you click Ignore, Setup
   continues.

<LI>"Setup could not create folder: &lt;folder name&gt;."
<P>
   Your options are to click Abort, Retry, or Ignore. If you click Abort, a
   message appears asking if you would like to quit Setup. If you click
   Retry, the message reappears. If you click Ignore, Setup continues.
<P>
</UL>The folder names in the messages refer to the server location for shared
files that was specified during a previous installation of Microsoft Office
Standard for Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if you selected the Server option when you installed
shared files in a Run From Server installation of Microsoft Office Standard
for Windows 95.
<P>
The location is not updated correctly when you install the Microsoft Office
Professional for Windows 95, and the Setup program cannot update files on
the server location because you do not have write privileges.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If this problem occurs when you run the Setup program for Microsoft Office
Professional for Windows 95, click Abort when the option is displayed, and
cancel the setup process. Then, run the Setup program for Microsoft Office
Standard for Windows 95, and choose the Remove All option. After you remove
Microsoft Office Standard for Windows 95 from your computer, rerun the
Setup program for Microsoft Office Professional for Windows 95.
<P>
If you have already installed Microsoft Office Professional for Windows 95,
use the following steps to work around the problem:

<OL><P><LI>Run the Setup program to remove Microsoft Office Professional for
   Windows 95.

<P><LI>Click the Remove All button.
<P>
   NOTE: When you remove Microsoft Office Professional for Windows 95, you
   may receive the following error message
<P>
<P><PRE>      Setup could not remove the &lt;folder name&gt; to &lt;file name&gt;. This
      file is currently being used by another application. Close any
      open applications.
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;folder name&gt; is the server location for shared files and &lt;file
   name&gt; is the name of a shared file.
<P>
   If the message appears, click Ignore and Setup will continue.

<P><LI>Run the Setup program to remove Microsoft Office Standard for
   Windows 95.

<P><LI>Click the Remove All Button.

<P><LI>Run the Setup program to reinstall Microsoft Office Professional for
   Windows 95.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may not occur if you chose to install the shared files on your
local hard disk instead of the server when you performed the workstation
installation of Microsoft Office Standard for Windows 95.
<P>
NOTE: Setup will prompt you to select a location for the shared files only
if you or your network administrator selected the User's Choice option for
the location of shared files during the Administrative installation of
Microsoft Office Standard for Windows 95.
