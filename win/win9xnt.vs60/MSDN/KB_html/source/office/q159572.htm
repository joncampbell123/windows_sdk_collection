<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use any of the programs included with Microsoft Office 97, if you
use the right mouse button (right-click) to click a file in the Open dialog
box, the Save As dialog box, Microsoft Outlook's File System view, or any
other dialog box that displays a list of files, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   SmartHeap Library
   MEM_BAD_POINTER

</PRE>If you click OK, the error message is displayed again. If you click Cancel,
you receive the error message once more. You also receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.

   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, you see the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;Program name&gt; caused an invalid page fault in module KERNEL32.DLL at
   014f:bff858cd.

</PRE>When you click Close, the dialog box is displayed again. You cannot click
Shut Down on the Start menu, and you cannot use CTRL+ALT+DELETE to restart
the computer: you must shut off your computer or press the reset button (if
your computer has one).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>

   Folder Popups, and/or Drive Popups options enabled (turned on).
<P>
   -and-

   the Open, Save As, Microsoft Outlook's File System view, or any other
   dialog box that displays a list of files.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>In the dialog box, you right-click any file.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, you can download and install a
patch for Norton Navigator from Symantec's web site.
<P>

<P>
</OL>To install the patch:

<OL><P><LI>Double-click the B-to-95c.exe file on your desktop. Then, click Extract.

<P><LI>When asked "Do you wish to open 'Apply.exe' now?", click Yes.
<P>

<P>

<OL><P><LI>If you are using the Norton Taskbar, click the Norton Navigator
   Control Center button on the taskbar. Otherwise, click the Start

<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This problem has been corrected by a patch for Norton Navigator for
Windows, version 1.0b. The patch may be downloaded and installed from
Symantec's web site.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Symantec's Norton Navigator for Windows 95 adds additional functionality to
Windows 95. One of the features it includes is the ability to add
additional options to shortcut menus and property dialog boxes when you are
working with files.
<P>
If you have Norton Navigator for Windows 95, version 1.0b installed on your
computer, and if you have the File Popups and Folder Popups options
enabled, right-clicking a file in any dialog box in a Microsoft Office 97
program may result in a series of error messages and (eventually) the
program will stop responding due to an invalid page fault. You will not be
able to properly shut down Windows 95. You will have to shut off your
computer or reset your computer.
<P>
NOTE: This problem does not occur when using Norton Navigator for Windows
95, version 1.0 or 1.0a.
<P>
Norton Navigator is manufactured by Symantec, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
