<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Office Assistant is a new Help feature in Microsoft
Office 97. Its functionality is similar to the Answer Wizard Help feature
in Microsoft Office 95.
<P>
You can make the Microsoft Office Assistant less interactive. Certain
features, such as Guess Help Topics and Display Alerts, can be disabled so
that the Microsoft Office Assistant provides help only when you request it.
<P>
You can also remove the Microsoft Office Assistant. If you remove the
Microsoft Office Assistant, you disable the ability to ask for help in a
natural language style, such as "How do I print my document?" Help is
still available through the Contents, Index, and Find tabs on the Help
menu, even when the Office Assistant is removed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Modify the Behavior of the Microsoft Office Assistant</h3>
 
<P>
To change how the Office Assistant behaves, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>If the Office Assistant is not visible, click the Office Assistant
   button on the toolbar.

<P><LI>Using the right mouse button (right-click), click the Office Assistant,
   click Options, and then in the Office Assistant dialog box, click the
   Options tab.

<P><LI>To make the Office Assistant provide minimal help, click to clear all
   check boxes except:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Respond to F1 key
    - Search for both product and programming help when programming
    - Move when in the way
    - Make sounds
</PRE><P>
   Clearing the Make Sounds check box is optional because it does not
   affect when the Microsoft Office Assistant offers help.

<P><LI>Clear all check boxes in the Show Tips About and the Other Tip
   Options sections.

<P><LI>Click OK to close the Office Assistant dialog box.
<P>
</OL><h3>Remove the Microsoft Office Assistant</h3>
 
<P>
When you remove the Microsoft Office Assistant, you disable one of the key
features of Microsoft Office 97 help: the ability to ask natural language
questions.
<P>
IMPORTANT: Microsoft recommends that you do not remove the Microsoft Office
Assistant.

<OL><P><LI>Close all programs and run Microsoft Office 97 Setup in
   Maintenance mode.

<P><LI>Click Add/Remove, click to select Office Tools, and click Change Option.

<P><LI>In the Office Tools dialog box, click to clear the Office Assistant
   check box. Click OK.

<P><LI>In the Maintenance mode dialog box, click Continue.

<P><LI>Click Yes when you are prompted to remove one component.

<P><LI>Setup will check for necessary disk space, update your system, and then
   display the message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Office 97 Setup was completed successfully.
</PRE><P>
   Click OK to continue.
<P>
   NOTE: The actor (.act) files related to the Microsoft Office Assistant
   are not installed by the Setup program and therefore are not removed
   by the Setup program. To completely remove the Microsoft Office
   Assistant, you must manually remove the actor files.

<P><LI>Remove the actor (.act) files. Each actor file provides functionality
   to a specific Office Assistant character. The default location for
   these files is:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Actors
</PRE><P>
   Delete the .act files from this location or the location in which you
   installed them.
