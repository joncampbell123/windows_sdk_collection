The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If a Binder contains a Microsoft Excel file that was created from a
template, one or more of the following error messages may occur when you
open the Binder or when you add or activate a section in of the Binder:

<UL><LI>Cannot open Template Wizard.

<LI>Cannot open AutoTemplate Wizard.

<LI>The numbering add-in must be loaded for optimal numbering and
   toolbar behavior.

<LI>Please load this add-in into you library directory.

<LI>Run-Time error '91': Object variable not Set.
   Range Method of Application Class failed.

<LI>Run-Time error '1000': Object variable not Set.
   Application does not have writeable Range property.

<LI>Run-Time error '429':
   ActiveX component can't create object

<LI>Run-Time error '91':
   Object variable or With block variable not Set.

<LI>This application cannot be completed because the other program is
   busy. Click the appropriate button on the task bar to activate the
   busy program and correct the problem.

<LI>This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists contact the program vendor.

<LI>EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module EXCEL.EXE.

<LI>EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module unknown.

<LI>EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module VBA32.dll.

<LI>BINDER caused an invalid page fault in module BINDER.EXE

<LI>Unable to write to the disk.

<LI>Document not saved. Any previously saved copy has been deleted.
<P>
</UL>In addition, the Binder and Microsoft Excel may stop responding (hang).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems occur because there are hidden Visual Basic for applications
macros attached to these templates. These macros cannot be run within a
Binder.
<P>
Some templates that have been reported to cause these symptoms include the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   Business Planner
   Car Lease Manager
   Change Request
   Expense Statement
   Invoice
   Loan Manager
   Personal Budgeter
   Purchase Order
   Sales Quote
   Timecard
   Village Software

</PRE>NOTE: Not all of these templates are installed with a complete installation
of Microsoft Office 97. Some of these templates are located in the \ValuPak
folder on you Microsoft Office CD-ROM.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you have Binder that contains a section created from one of these
templates, you can unbind it. To do this, use the  right mouse button to
click the Binder and then click Unbind on the shortcut menu.
<P>
In some cases, error messages may continue to appear, and your only option
is to click Retry. In other cases, Microsoft Binder may stop responding
(hang). If Microsoft Binder hangs, press CTRL+ALT+DEL, and then select
Microsoft Office Binders/Microsoft Excel and click End Task.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. Microsoft is researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
