The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows

</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry  Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you create a system policy for the Network Neighborhood that restricts
network access, users can still map a network drive from within the
individual Microsoft Office programs.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you run the Policy Editor program and, by using
the Common.adm policy template, click Hide Network Neighborhood in the
Shell restrictions.
<P>
In an Office 97 program, when you click Commands And Settings in the Save
As dialog box, you can click Map Network Drive and connect to a network
drive.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit includes a collection of templates
that you can use with the System Policy Editor to specify user policies for
the Office programs.
<P>
You can edit the registry by using System Policy Editor (Poledit.exe) or
Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). However, check with your network
administrator before you make any changes to the registry.
<P>
If you are using the Office 97 system policy templates that are included
in the Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit, you must use the version of the
System Policy Editor that is included in the Microsoft Office 97 Resource
Kit or the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit.
<P>
NOTE: You can download Policy.exe, a self-extracting executable file
containing Poledit.exe, from online services. Download this file from the
following Web site:
<P>
