<P>
This article contains information from the Microsoft World Wide Web site
regarding the Microsoft Office Manager Updater. The Office Manager Updater
is a patch to the Microsoft Office Manager to update any version of
Microsoft Office Manager to version 4.2.1c.

</PRE>The Microsoft Office Manager Updater updates all previous versions of MOM,
including all localized versions, to incorporate code changes made in
version 4.2.1c of the Office Manager.
<P>
MOM version 4.2.1c primarily addresses two problems found in earlier
versions. The first problem occurs with version 7.5.2 or later of Apple's
System software: because of the way these versions of the operating system
manage system resources, very small applications such as MOM may freeze or
crash when running on a Power Macintosh. To avoid these errors, version
4.2.1c of the Office Manager reserves a larger block of memory when running
(still less than 100k of RAM). The second problem involves possible
redundant alias resources being added to the Office Manager Preferences
file when you add documents to the Office Manager Menu.
<P>
When launched, the Updater will search your system for all installed copies
of Microsoft Office Manager. It will list the locations of all copies it
finds, noting which ones (if any) have already been updated. You can choose
to update all of the copies listed, or just a few. If you have copies of
Microsoft Office Manager that you'd like to update on a floppy disk or
other unmounted volume, you can use the "Search" button to locate these
copies and add them to the list.
<P>
Once all selected copies of Microsoft Office Manager have been successfully
updated, you may either choose to update other copies of MOM, or quit the
Updater program. If you have updated a copy of the Office Manager which is
located in an active System Folder, you will need to restart the computer
for the update to take effect.
