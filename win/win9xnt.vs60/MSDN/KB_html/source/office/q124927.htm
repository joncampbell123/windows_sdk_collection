The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows NT, version 4.2
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows NT, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows NT, version 6.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following symptoms occur if you install Microsoft Excel or
Microsoft Word to a directory with a long name that contains a space
character:

<UL><LI>When you insert a Microsoft Excel 5.0 Worksheet object in a Microsoft
   Word document, or a Microsoft Word 6.0 Document object in a Microsoft
   Excel worksheet, you receive one of the following error messages:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Excel
      ---------------
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Cannot start the source application for this object
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      In Microsoft Word
      -----------------
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      The server application, source file, or item cannot be found. Make
      sure the application is properly installed, and that it has not been
      deleted, moved, or renamed.
</PRE>
<LI>When you start the application by clicking the application button on
   the Microsoft Office Manager (MOM) toolbar, you receive the following
   error message
<P>
<P><PRE>      Cannot find &lt;FILENAME.EXE&gt;. Please start the application another way.
      While the application is running, click the toolbar button or
      choose the menu command again.
</PRE><P>
   where FILENAME.EXE is the name of the executable file for the
   application.

<LI>When you choose Office Setup And Uninstall from the Microsoft Office
   menu, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Cannot execute 'c:\this'. Try to execute this application from File
      Manager or Program Manager for a more detailed error message.
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: The error message contains the first word in the directory name,
   ignoring any characters following the space in the directory name. For
   example, the error message uses 'c:\this' if you install the
   application to the directory "c:\this is a long directory."

<LI>The Microsoft Excel Samples icon that is added to the Program Manager
   group uses the generic icon. When you double-click the icon to open the
   SAMPLES.XLS file in Microsoft Excel, you receive the following error
   message
<P>
<P><PRE>      Program Not Found: Cannot find &lt;this.exe&gt;. This program is needed to
      run files with extension '.XLS.' Location of &lt;this.exe&gt;:
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;this.exe&gt; is the first word in the long directory name and the
   .exe extension , (only the characters before the first space in the
   directory name).
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when you run the Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word
Setup program, and you change the default directory to a long filename that
contains a space, such as C:\this is a long directory\excel.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving any of these symptoms, install Microsoft Excel or
Microsoft Word to a directory that does not contain any space
characters. To reinstall Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word, do the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   1. In File Manager, rename the Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word
      directory by changing any spaces in the directory name to underscore
      characters.

   2. Rename the SETUP.STF file (located is in the SETUP subdirectory of
      the directory to which you installed the application).

   3. Run Setup again, and install the application to the directory that
      you renamed in Step 1.

</PRE>This procedure corrects all of the symptoms listed above, and must be
used to correct the error you receive when you insert a Microsoft
Excel or Microsoft Word object.
<P>
Note that if you reinstall Microsoft Excel to a new directory, you
may receive an error message when you start Microsoft Excel,
indicating that Microsoft Excel cannot locate the add-in files. If
you receive this error message, you can use the Add-Ins dialog box to
correct the path to the add-in files.
<P>
<P><h3>Inserting Object</h3>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving an error message when you insert a Microsoft Excel
5.0 Worksheet object, or a Microsoft Word 6.0 Document object, see
the workaround listed above.
<P>
<P><h3>MOM Toolbar</h3>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving an error message when you run Microsoft Excel or
Microsoft Word from the MOM toolbar, you can create a custom button
by doing the following:

<OL><P><LI>From the Microsoft Office menu, choose Customize.

<P><LI>Select the Toolbar tab, and then choose the Add button.

<P><LI>Choose the Browse button. From the File Name list, select WINWORD.EXE
   or EXCEL.EXE, and choose OK.

<P><LI>Choose OK to add the application to the toolbar.
<P>
</OL>To remove the extra button, choose Customize from the Microsoft
Office menu, and clear the check box for "Microsoft Word" or
"Microsoft Excel".
<P>
<P><h3>Office Manager Menu Setup</h3>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving an error message when you run Setup from the
Microsoft Office menu, run Setup from your original installation
disks, from the Microsoft Office CD, or by using the Setup icon in
Program Manager.
<P>
<P><h3>MS Excel Samples Icon</h3>
 
<P>
To avoid receiving an error message when you double-click the MS
Excel Samples icon at Program Manager, change the command line for
the MS Excel Samples icon to include the application path in
quotation marks. For example, change the following icon command line
<P>
<PRE>   "c:\this is a long filename\examples\samples.xls"

</PRE></OL>to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   "c:\this is a long filename\excel.exe" "c:\this is a long
   filename\examples\samples.xls"

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft
products listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
