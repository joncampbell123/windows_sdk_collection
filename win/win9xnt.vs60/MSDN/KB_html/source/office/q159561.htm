<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Camcorder is a screen-capture technology that allows easy
creation of movies. It is a simple but powerful movie recorder and playback
utility. It captures screen events, stores them as a portable file, and
allows play back. This utility enables you to create movies and save them
in an .avi file format or export them in a .exe file format. The greatest
advantage is that people who receive the .exe file can play the movie
without having Camcorder installed on their computers.
<P>
This article will walk you through the steps for creating a sample movie in
a .avi file format and for creating a .exe which you can share with someone
who does not have Camcorder installed on his or her computer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

<P>
</OL>NOTE: These .exe files do not contain an Authenticode digital signature, a
certificate that renders programs tamper-proof, thus complicating Web
distribution. Clients downloading the .exe movies have no idea of whether
they contain a virus or not, and Microsoft Internet Explorer will display a
warning to this effect.
