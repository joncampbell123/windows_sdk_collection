<PRE>1. Q. What is the Microsoft Office Shortcut Bar?

   A. Formerly known as Microsoft Office Manager (MOM), the Office
      Shortcut Bar has been enhanced to complement the Windows 95
      user interface. It is evolving with the operating system, and
      it is becoming less of a tool to start your programs and more
      of a program management tool.

2. Q. How can I use the Office Shortcut Bar to switch between
      programs?

   A. It takes only one click to access Office for Windows 95. The
      Office Shortcut Bar provides instant access to Office
      interoperability, allowing you to start or switch between
      programs. Two buttons on the Office Shortcut Bar "Open A
      Document" and "Start A New Document" are shared by all the
      Office programs: use these buttons to open existing and create
      new Office documents.

3. Q. Can I move the Office Shortcut Bar?

   A. Yes. You can click and drag the Office Shortcut Bar to move it
      to different locations on the desktop. The Office Shortcut Bar
      responds to changes in screen resolution and intelligently
      adjusts its size and position to remain "docked" (located
      against one of the edges of your screen). It can also be placed
      on the Windows 95 desktop in a "floating" fashion.

4. Q. How can I hide the Office Shortcut Bar?

   A. The Office Shortcut Bar can be set to Auto Hide, which causes
      it to disappear from the screen when it is not in use. You can
      also use the "AutoFit Into Title Bar Area" option to display
      the Office Shortcut Bar within the title bar of a program. When
      the Office Shortcut Bar is displayed this way, all the
      advantages that the Office Shortcut Bar provides are available,
      but you can still work in full-screen mode. Also, unlike
      Microsoft Office Manager in earlier versions of Microsoft
      Office, the Office Shortcut Bar can be minimized in any mode.

5. Q. How can I customize the Office Shortcut Bar?

   A. The Office Shortcut Bar features multiple toolbars that can be
      customized to include favorite programs, documents, and
      folders. You can also add other Windows 95 programs to the
      Office Shortcut Bar toolbars. To add a button to the Office
      Shortcut Bar, simply drag an icon or filename from My Computer,
      Windows Explorer, or the Windows 95 desktop.
