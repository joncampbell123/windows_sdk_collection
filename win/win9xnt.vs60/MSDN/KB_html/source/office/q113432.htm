The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Disk 1 of Microsoft Office version 4.2 (compliance
checking version), you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find CTL3D.DLL

</PRE>NOTE: The file IS present in compressed form on Disk 1.
<P>
In addition to the above error message, you may also receive:
<P>
<PRE>   Top Level Parser: Bad DLL Value

   -or-

   Top Level INF Parser: Bad DLL Data Value

   -or-

   Top Level INF Parser: Bad DLL Value

   -or-

   Processing Top Level information failed

</PRE>You may not receive the full message in Windows 95. The first message may
be skipped and the next two error messages may appear in a single dialog.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The ODBCINST.DLL, which is installed during Setup, requires CTL3D.DLL for
correct installation. The error message occurs if either of the following
is true:

<UL><LI>This file is not present in the C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>CTL3D.DLL is not referenced in the SETUP.LST file that shipped on Disk 1
   of the compliance checking version of Office 4.2.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, follow the procedure below. If you are a
network administrator and need to do many installations of Office, the
procedure is efficient and requires no additional changes for the
workstation installations.
<UL><LI>Add CTL3D.DLL to the SETUP.LST file before running setup:
<P>
   1. At the MS-DOS command prompt, switch to the floppy disk drive that
<P><PRE>      contains the Setup disk. For example, if the Setup disk is in drive
      A, type "a:" (without the quotation marks).
</PRE><P>
   2. When the prompt changes to the desired drive letter (in this example,
<P><PRE>      a:), type "copy SETUP.LST c:\setup.old" (without the quotation marks)
      and press ENTER.
</PRE><P>
   3. To edit this file in the MS-DOS Editor, type "edit SETUP.LST"
<P><PRE>      (without the quotation marks), and press ENTER.
</PRE><P>
   4. In the [Files] section of the SETUP.LST file, type:
<P>
<PRE>         CTL3D.DL_ = CTL3D.DLL

      NOTE: If you type CTL3D.DL_ = CTL3D,DLL (notice the comma), you
      receive the error message:

         There is insufficient memory or disk space to run setup.
         Setup requires at least 900K of free disk space. Try shutting
         down other applications, restarting Windows, or freeing some
         disk space.

   5. Choose Exit from the File menu in the MS-DOS Editor and save your
      changes.
