The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, Professional Edition
<LI>Microsoft Access version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
When you install Microsoft Access, you receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   MSACAL32.OCX was unable to register itself in the registry.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because of an error when the system tries to register
the Calendar OLE Custom Control component in the registry.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Problems registering OLE Custom Controls can usually be traced to one of
the following problems:

<UL><LI>The OLE Custom Control file was not properly decompressed when it was
   copied from the floppy disk or compact disc. To verify that the file was
   properly decompressed, check the properties of the OLE Custom Control
   file (Msacal70.ocx). Ensure that the file version is reported as 7.0,
   the file size is reported as 80,896 bytes, and that the file is located
   in the Windows\System folder in Windows 95 or the Windows\System32
   folder in Windows NT.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You have insufficient permissions to modify the system registry. This
   problem has been reported with Windows NT only. To ensure that you have
   sufficient permissions to the registry, make sure that the user
   currently logged on to the Windows NT machine is a member of the
   Administrators security group.
<P>
</UL>To work around this problem, you can attempt to manually register a custom
control once Microsoft Access is installed. To do this, use the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Start Microsoft Access and open any database.

<P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Custom Controls.

<P><LI>Choose the Register button.

<P><LI>Browse for the OLE Custom Control file that you wish to register. Click
   OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Access version
7.0 and in Microsoft Office Professional version 7.0. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The error message incorrectly reports the name of the file as Msacal32.ocx.
The correct name for the file is Msacal70.ocx. Although the error message
is incorrect, the Setup program does attempt to register the correct file
name. The error message is displayed because an error occurred when
registering Msacal70.ocx.
<P>
