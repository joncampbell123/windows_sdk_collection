<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Office, when a document that is password protected at the file
level becomes part of an Office binder, the password protection is lost.
You will be prompted to enter a password when the document is first added
to the binder; however, once it becomes a binder section, the protection is
lost.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In addition to protection at the file level, Microsoft Excel offers
workbook and worksheet protection. For example, if you want to assign a
password that prevents changes to the worksheet or to the workbook
structure in Microsoft Excel, point to Protection on the Tools menu, and
then click either Protect Sheet or Protect Workbook. This type of
protection is preserved when the file is added as a section to a binder,
even though password protection at the file level is lost.
<P>
A binder file itself cannot be password protected. However, you can protect
a binder from changes by placing it on a read-only network share. By doing
this, users can open and view the binder but are unable to make changes to
it.
