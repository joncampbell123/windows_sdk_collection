</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.
<P>
The Compliance Checking Program (CCP) in the upgrade version of Microsoft
Access 97 fails to recognize Microsoft Office 97 Small Business Edition as
an application that qualifies for the competitive upgrade program.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Call Microsoft Technical Support for assistance installing your upgrade
version of Microsoft Access 97. Refer to your product literature or your
support contract for the technical support number to call. Or, to obtain
the support phone number for your product, please visit Microsoft's
"Support Options &amp; Phone Numbers" Web page at the following address:
<P>
<PRE>    <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/">http://www.microsoft.com/supportnet/</A></B>

</PRE>When you call Microsoft Technical Support and speak with a support
engineer, please inform the engineer that you own a qualifying program
and that you need assistance installing it.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the upgrade version of
Microsoft Access 97. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you own one of a selected list of database applications, you qualify for
the Microsoft Access competitive upgrade, which entitles you to buy an
upgrade version of Microsoft Access at a reduced price. The Setup program
checks for a qualifying competitive database program before it installs
Microsoft Access.
<P>
Microsoft Office 97 Small Business Edition is one of the products that
qualifies for the Microsoft Access competitive upgrade program; however,
the Setup program fails to recognize it as such. For a list of other
database programs that qualify for a competitive upgrade, refer to the
Microsoft Access 97 upgrade version box, or see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
