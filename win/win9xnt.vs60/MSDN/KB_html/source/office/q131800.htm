<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0

<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you delete a toolbar that you added to the Microsoft Office Shortcut
Bar, the folder for the toolbar is not removed from your computer.
<P>
Additionally, if you add a toolbar to the Shortcut Bar as a blank toolbar,
and you use the name of a previously deleted toolbar, you receive the
following error message
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot create a blank toolbar called '&lt;toolbar&gt;' because there is a
   previously deleted toolbar by that name. Do you want to add the
   previously deleted toolbar instead?

</PRE>where &lt;toolbar&gt; is the name of the toolbar you are adding.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Office. When you add a toolbar to
the Office Shortcut bar using a new, blank folder, a folder is created in
the Office\Shortcut Bar folder in the Microsoft Office folder. When you add
a toolbar to the Shortcut Bar using an existing folder, an entry for this
folder is added to the Windows registration file, and a toolbar for this
folder is added to the Shortcut Bar. In either case, when you remove the
toolbar that you added to the Shortcut Bar, the underlying folder is not
removed from your hard drive.
<P>
Because of this behavior, when you add a blank toolbar to the Shortcut Bar
that has the same name as a toolbar that you previously removed, you
receive the warning described above indicating that you cannot create a
toolbar with this same name.
<P>
Note that you can add a toolbar for an existing folder, even if you have
previously removed a toolbar for the same folder. However, if you remove
the toolbar, and then add the toolbar again for the same folder without
closing the Customize dialog box after removing the toolbar, you receive
the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   The toolbar named "toolbar" is being reserved for future use

</PRE>where toolbar is the name of the toolbar that you are adding.
<P>
Note that when you remove a toolbar that you added to the Shortcut Bar, the
registry entry for the toolbar is removed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you want to remove the folder for a toolbar that you remove from the
Office Shortcut bar, use My Computer or Explorer to locate the folder (in
the Office\Shortcut Bar folder in the Microsoft Office folder if you
created the toolbar from a new, blank folder) and drag the folder to the
Recycle Bin.
