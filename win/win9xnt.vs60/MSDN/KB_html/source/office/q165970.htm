The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When Microsoft Find Fast is creating or updating an index, your computer
appears to slow down until the index is created or updated.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when either of the following conditions is true:

<UL><LI>You shut down the computer while Find Fast is creating or updating an
   index.
<P>
   The next time you start your computer, Find Fast must restart and
   complete the index.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>Other programs automatically start when you start Microsoft Windows.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You are running other programs that have a lower processing priority
   than Microsoft Find Fast.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To help minimize the amount of time that Microsoft Find Fast requires to
create or update an index, use the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Before you shut down the computer, verify that Microsoft Find Fast has
completed processing any indices. To check the status of your indices, use
the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, point to Settings and click Control Panel. In the
   Control Panel, double-click Find Fast to run it.

<P><LI>For each of your indices, check the Status column. If the status for any
   index is Now Creating or Now Updating, Find Fast is processing the
   index. A status of Update Automatically indicates that the index is
   updated and that Find Fast is idle.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Increase the update interval. When you specify a larger interval of time
after which Find Fast can update the indexes, it is less likely that you
will interrupt Find Fast while it is running. This is true because indices
are updated less often. The interval ranges are in whole hours. To increase
the interval, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, point to Settings and click Control Panel. In the
   Control Panel, double-click Find Fast to run it.

<P><LI>On the Index menu, click Update Interval. In the Update Interval dialog
   box, change the value in the "For automatic updates, index again
   every __ hour(s)" box. This value must be an integer.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Find Fast utility is installed when you install Microsoft Office. If
your computer has more then 8 megabytes (MB) of random access memory (RAM),
Find Fast creates a hidden index on each of the local drives on your
computer. These indices contain words, titles, and OLE properties for each
file on that drive. The indices help speed up finding and opening files
when you use the Advanced Find and Open dialog boxes within the Microsoft
Office programs.
<P>
