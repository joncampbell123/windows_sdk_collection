<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you are troubleshooting a problem with one of the Microsoft
applications listed above, do not delete any of these applications
settings or registration files from your computer. Instead, move the
files out of the Preferences folder onto the desktop to disable them,
and then start the application to create the new files.
<P>
If the problem that you are troubleshooting still occurs after you
move and re-create these files, you can then delete the newly created
files, and move the original files back to the Preferences folder to
restore them.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Registration Database file (and the PPC Registration Database
file) stores information about how Microsoft Office and the Microsoft
Office applications are configured for a specific computer. If you
delete this file, then the Setup program for Microsoft Office, or one
of the Microsoft Office applications is not able to perform certain
maintenance operations.
<P>
The settings file for each of the Microsoft Office applications, such
as Word Settings (6), contains information that is not restored if the
file is not created by the installation process. For example, if you
delete an application's settings file, and you then run the
application, the settings file is created again. However, the new
settings file does not contain all of the information that the file
contained when you installed the application.
<P>
For example, if you remove the Registration Database file from the
System:Preferences folder and then try to use Find File from the Office
Manager, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The Registration Database information was not
   found. Please run Setup to install the necessary
   files.

</PRE>In order to get the Find File feature to work after getting this error
message, put the original Registration Database file back into the
System:Preferences folder to replace the new one that is created.
