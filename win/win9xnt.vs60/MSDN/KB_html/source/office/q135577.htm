The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows

<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use a shared application after installing one of the programs
listed above, you may receive an error message indicating that the
application was not installed. For example, when you use Microsoft Map
(Data Map in version 7.0) after installing Microsoft Office, you may
receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Data Map is not installed. To use Data Map you must run
   Setup and choose to add Microsoft Data Map

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when you perform a Run From Server installation of
two different programs that use the same shared applications, and you
then remove one of the programs and perform a local installation. For
example, this problem occurs when you do the following:

<UL><LI>Perform a Run From Network Server installation of Microsoft Excel

<LI>Perform a Run From Network Server installation of Microsoft Office

<LI>Remove Microsoft Office

<LI>Perform a Typical installation of Microsoft Office
<P>
</UL>This problem occurs because the registry entries for the shared
application may incorrectly point to the server installation, even after
you perform a local installation of the application.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, you should uninstall a workstation
installation of a standalone Office application before installing a
workstation installation of Microsoft Office.
<P>
In a network environment, it is important to uninstall a standalone
Office program (Run From Network Server) before installing Microsoft
Office (Run From Network Server). If you don't uninstall the standalone
Office program first, you may have Windows registry problems that prevent
you from having a correct installation of Microsoft Office in the future.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Under the conditions described above, you may receive the following error
message when you insert an Equation Editor object in your document
<P>
<PRE>   The Windows registration database file is not valid. You may want to
   rerun the Setup program

</PRE>followed by:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot start the source application for this object

</PRE>Additionally, if you no longer have network access on your computer, you
may receive the following error message when you insert an Organization
Chart object in your document:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot start the source application for this object
