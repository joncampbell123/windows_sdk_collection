<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The problems described above occur because the programs included in
Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition may assume that you have Microsoft
Internet Explorer installed on your computer, especially when preferences
files are initially created. Depending on the order in which you install
your programs, the problems may occur.
<P>
Netscape Navigator is manufactured by Netscape, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
