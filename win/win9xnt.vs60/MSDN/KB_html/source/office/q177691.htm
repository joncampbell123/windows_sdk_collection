The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition
<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
<LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the programs listed at the beginning of this article, if you click New
on the File menu, the New dialog box that appears may contain more than one
General tab. Also, each time you click New on the File menu, the New dialog
box may contain an additional General tab.
<P>
This problem persists after you quit and restart the running programs or
after you restart your computer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if you create a folder named "General" in the Microsoft
Office 98:Templates folder on your hard disk.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, do not create a General folder in the Templates
folder.
<P>
If this problem has already occurred, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Quit all running programs.

<P><LI>Using the Finder, delete the "Microsoft Office Settings (8)" file, which
   is located in the System Folder:Preferences folder.

<P><LI>Using the Finder, do any of the following:
<P>
   - Delete the General folder in the Templates folder.
   - Rename the General folder in the Templates folder.
   - Move the General folder out of the Templates folder and into
<P><PRE>     another folder.
</PRE><P>
</OL>NOTE: This process also deletes other settings, such as your user name and
initials, in the programs included in Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh
Edition. There is no way to prevent the loss of these settings.
<P>
After you perform these steps, only one General tab appears when you click
New on the File menu in any of the Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition
programs.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you create a folder in the Templates folder, the folder appears as a
tab in the New dialog box in the Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition
programs. A General tab also appears by default; this tab does not require
a folder in the Templates folder.
<P>
If you create your own General folder, the tabs in the New dialog box
appear incorrectly. A problem with the dialog box causes the tabs to
continue to increase until you perform the steps in the "Resolution"
section.
<P>
If you want to create your own folder for templates, do not name the folder
"General"; use a different name. If you use a different name, the problem
does not occur.
