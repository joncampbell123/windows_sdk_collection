</PRE><h3>Inspect and Clean the Compact Disc</h3>
 
<P>
To verify that the compact disc is clean and free of scratches, inspect the
shiny side of the disc. Clean the disc by wiping it with a soft cloth in a
straight line, starting from the center of the disc and wiping towards the
edge. If there are no visible scratches, and if the errors still occur
after you clean the compact disc, follow the steps in the next section. If
the compact disc appears scratched, try a new compact disc.
<P>
If you determine that you have a damaged Microsoft Office Setup compact
disc, you can order a new compact disc. To obtain a replacement compact
disc, call the Microsoft Order Desk at (800) 360-7561 and request a
replacement compact disc. If you are outside the United States, contact the
Microsoft subsidiary for your area. To locate your subsidiary, see the
Microsoft World Wide Offices Web page at:

</PRE>Testing for a Damaged Compact Disc
 
<P>
To determine whether the disc is damaged, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Microsoft Office disc into the CD-ROM drive.

<P><LI>Click Start, point to Programs, and then click MS-DOS Prompt.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS prompt, change to the CD-ROM drive (usually drive E) and
   type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      dir /s
</PRE><P>
</OL>If error message appears, the disc is damaged or the CD-ROM drive cannot
read the contents of the entire disc.
<P>
For more information about using the MS-DOS command prompt, see your
Windows printed documentation or online Help.
<P>
<P><h3>Disable the CD-ROM Drive Cache</h3>
 
<P>
If the error message appears while you are reading from a CD-ROM drive, try
disabling the CD-ROM drive cache. Although disabling the drive cache may
make the drive more reliable, it reduces performance. To disable the CD-ROM
drive cache, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

<P><LI>In Control Panel, double-click System.

<P><LI>Click the Performance tab and click File System.

<P><LI>Click the CD-ROM tab, click No Read-Ahead in the "Optimize access
   pattern for" list.

<P><LI>Verify that the Supplemental Cache Size slider is positioned in the far
   left position (the Small setting), and then click OK.
<P>
</OL>If you are using real-mode CD-ROM drive drivers, the drive may be cached by
the Smartdrv.exe program. If this is the case, remark the line that
pertains to the Smartdrv.exe program in the Autoexec.bat file by typing
"REM" (without the quotation marks) at the beginning of the line. To do
this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, and then click Run.

<P><LI>In the Open box, type "sysedit" (without the quotation marks),
   and then click OK.

<P><LI>Examine the Autoexec.bat file. Look for a line that references the
   Smartdrv.exe file, for example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\WINDOWS\Smartdrv.exe
</PRE><P>
   Make this line a remark by typing "REM" (without the quotation marks) at
   the beginning of the line.

<P><LI>Click Exit to quit the System Configuration Editor. When you are
   prompted to save changes, click Yes.
<P>
</OL>For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Computer Hangs Copying Data from CD-ROM Drive

</PRE></OL>Install Real Mode CD-ROM Drivers for Office Installation
 
<P>
You may need to install real mode CD-ROM drive drivers under Microsoft
Windows 95 when you are troubleshooting problems that occur when
you install Microsoft Office. For information about installing real mode CD-
ROM drivers, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../office/q167069.htm">Q167069</A></B>
   TITLE     : Installing Real Mode CD-ROM Drivers for Office Installation

</PRE>NOTE: By following the steps in article <B><A href="../office/q167069.htm">Q167069</A></B>, you are able to boot into
Windows Safe mode, which prevents other programs and device drivers that
may be conflicting with the CD-ROM driver from running.
<P>
<P><h3>Disabling the Compact Disc AutoPlay Feature in Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
Windows 95 continuously detects whether a CD is inserted in the CD-ROM
drive. When a CD is detected, Windows 95 checks the volume for an
Autorun.inf file. If the volume contains an Autorun.inf file, programs
listed on the "open=" line in the file are run. This feature is called
AutoPlay.
<P>
To disable both the automatic running of CDs and the automatic playing
of audio CDs, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, and click Control Panel. In Control
   Panel, double-click System.

<P><LI>Click the Device Manager tab.

<P><LI>Double-click the plus sign next to CD-ROM, and then double-click the CD-
   ROM driver entry.

<P><LI>On the Settings tab, click to clear the "Auto Insert Notification" check
   box.

<P><LI>Click OK or "Close until you return to Control Panel." When you are
   prompted to restart your computer, click Yes.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Be sure to reverse the steps to enable AutoPlay after you finish
troubleshooting.

   TITLE     :How to Disable Automatic CD-ROM Running and Audio CD Playing

</PRE></OL><h3>Disable Enhanced BIOS Features</h3>
 
<P>
WARNING: Incorrectly altering hardware BIOS settings can cause serious
problems that may cause your computer to fail to start or function
properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems that result from the
incorrect setting of hardware BIOS options can be solved. Alter the
hardware BIOS settings at your own risk.
<P>
Most computers have several enhanced settings that allow the computer to
fully utilize the computer hardware. These high-speed settings can cause
the system to become unstable; disabling these features may make the
computer more stable. Contact your computer manufacturer for information
about entering the basic input/output system (BIOS) and changing the BIOS
settings. You can enter the BIOS on most systems immediately after turning
on the power. Usually a keystroke (for example, pressing DEL) is required
to enter the BIOS. The common features that can interfere with Microsoft
Office programs are the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Memory Shadow RAM
   Video Shadow RAM
   Internal Cache
   External Cache
   Built-in Virus Protection

</PRE>Newer chip sets may have more advanced features (such as memory wait
states) that may cause errors. Most BIOS installation programs have an
option to load the BIOS default settings. This option usually disables all
advanced features.
<P>
<P><h3>Check for Software Updates</h3>
 
<P>
Outdated and incompatible software may also cause error messages to appear.
Check with the manufacturer of the computer for various software updates,
such as BIOS updates, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) Windows
updates, and CD-ROM drive driver updates.
<P>
<P><h3>Office 97: Test Your CD-ROM Drive by Using Microsoft System Information</h3>
 
<P>
You can also use Microsoft System Information that is included in Microsoft
Office 97 to verify the integrity of a CD. In Microsoft System Information,
see the CDROM device entry.
<P>
To test your CD-ROM drive with Microsoft System Information, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Microsoft Office 97 compact disc into the CD-ROM drive.

<P><LI>On the Start menu, click Run. In the Open box, type the following
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;drive letter&gt;:\os\msapps\msinfo\msinfo32.exe
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive letter&gt; is the drive letter for the CD-ROM drive, and then
   click OK.
<P>
   For example, type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      d:\os\msapps\msinfo\msinfo32.exe
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click CD-ROM in the left pane. If there are multiple CD-ROM drives
   installed on your computer, click the correct drive letter.
<P>
</OL>Microsoft System Information lists the following items:

<UL><LI>Drive
<LI>Volume
<LI>Total Space
<LI>Transfer File
<LI>Transfer Size
<LI>Data Transfer Rate
<LI>CPU Util @ 300kb/s
<LI>Integrity File
<LI>Data Transfer Integrity
<LI>Device
<LI>Description
<P>
</UL>Inspect Data Transfer Integrity to see if the CD-ROM drive functions
correctly. The Value column should display "Tested OK" for Data Transfer
Integrity.
