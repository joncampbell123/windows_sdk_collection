The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.2-CD
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.3-CD
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.3c-CD with Bookshelf
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform an Administrative installation (/a) of Microsoft Office
from the CD, 110 megabytes (MB) of viewer files will be copied to the
server directory. These viewer files are used to provide online
documentation to the workstation users. If you have enough hard drive space
on the server, you can delete the server MVIEWER subdirectory after the
network installation. However, if you do not have the additional space on
the server, you may need to modify the SETUP.STF file so that it does not
install the *.BMP files. Note that the viewer files are in addition to 112
megabytes (MB) of application files, for a total of almost 250 megabytes.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To make modifications to the SETUP.STF file and use it from the CD, do
the following:

<OL><P><LI>Decompress the SETUP.ST_ file from the d:\setup.adm\disk1 directory to
   the hard drive. At the MS-DOS command prompt type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      decomp setup.st_ c:\msoffice\setup\setup.stf
</PRE><P>
   and press ENTER. You must use the decompression utility DECOMP.EXE that
   is included with Office. The MS-DOS EXPAND.EXE utility yields unusable
   results. Note: c:\msoffice is the directory to which you installed
   Microsoft Office.
<P>
   NOTE: Microsoft Office 4.3c-CD with Bookshelf has an uncompressed file
   called SETUP.STF. No decompression is necessary. You can copy it from
   the d:\setup.adm\disk1 directory to the hard drive with a line similar
   to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy setup.stf c:\msoffice\setup\setup.stf
</PRE>
<P><LI>Make sure the file is not set to read-only.

<P><LI>Modify the .STF file for 4.2 or 4.3. Before you make any modifications
   to the file, make a backup copy. To modify the file, open SETUP.STF in
   a text editor (not the MS-DOS Editor as it will replace tabs with
   spaces) or use the Text Import Wizard in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
   Note, If you open SETUP.STF in Microsoft Excel 5.0, complete the
   following additional steps before continuing:
<P>
<P><PRE>      In the Text Import Wizard dialog box, choose Next until Step 3
      Of 3 appears.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      In the Text Import Wizard - Step 3 Of 3 dialog box, under Data
      Preview, click the second column to select it. Under Column Data
      Format, select the Text option, and choose Finish.
</PRE><P>
   For Microsoft Office 4.2-CD:
<P>
   a. Object ID 27, remove number 4500. (This stops the Administrative
<P><PRE>      installation from copying the *.BMP files.)
</PRE><P>
   b. Object ID 36, remove 4545, 4557, 5217. (This prevents the workstation
<P><PRE>      installation from creating icons to the *.BMP files.)
</PRE><P>
   For Microsoft Office 4.3-CD:
<P>
   a. Object ID 31, remove number 5100. (This stops the Administrative
<P><PRE>      installation from copying the *.BMP  files.)
</PRE><P>
   b. Object ID 40, remove 5145, 5157, 5014. (This prevents the workstation
<P><PRE>      installation from creating icons to the *.BMP files.)
</PRE><P>
   For Microsoft Office 4.3c-CD with Bookshelf:
<P>
   a. Object ID 31, remove number 5085. (This stops the Administrative
<P><PRE>      installation from copying the *.BMP  files.)
</PRE><P>
   b. Object ID 40, remove number 5277. (This prevents the workstation
<P><PRE>      installation from creating icons to the *.BMP files.)
</PRE><P>
   To run setup with this modified file, type the following
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;drive&gt;\setup.adm\disk1\setup /a /t &lt;path&gt;\setup.stf
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is your CD drive, and &lt;path&gt; is the full path (including
   the drive letter) to the drive that contains the modified .STF file.
   Make sure that the original file is not in a position in which it will
   be written over during the installation. The steps above will copy the
   modified .STF file to the Administrative installation, where it will be
   used by the workstation installations.
<P>
   NOTE: you should install Microsoft Office to a clean (empty) directory.
