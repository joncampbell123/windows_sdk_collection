<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Windows operating system provides two routines that can be
called by Microsoft Office 97 programs to get the Windows and the Windows
System directories.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including,
but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness
for a particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are
provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in
all situations. While Microsoft support engineers can help explain the
functionality of a particular macro, they will not modify these examples to
provide added functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to
meet your specific needs. If you have limited programming experience, you
may want to consult one of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution
Providers offer a wide range of fee-based services, including creating
custom macros. For more information about Microsoft Solution Providers,
call Microsoft Customer Information Service at (800) 426-9400.
<P>
When Windows starts, it sets a special environment variable called
"windir" with the path from which Windows was started. You can use the
following macro instruction to post the Windows directory to a message box.
<P>
<PRE>   MsgBox Environ$("windir")

</PRE>However, there is no argument to return the Windows System directory when
using this method. The following examples use Windows API calls to return
both the Windows and Windows System directories.
<P>
The following macro example retrieves the Windows and Windows System
directories and prints them to the Debug (Immediate) window inside the
Visual Basic for Applications Editor.
<P>
<PRE>' Place these declarations in the General Declarations procedure of a
' Visual Basic for Applications module.

   Declare Function GetWindowsDirectoryA Lib "Kernel32" _
   (ByVal lpBuffer As String, ByVal nSize As Long) As Long
   Declare Function GetSystemDirectoryA Lib "Kernel32" _
   (ByVal lpBuffer As String, ByVal nSize As Long) As Long

</PRE>Create a macro and place the following code into the routine.
<P>
<PRE>   Sub GetOSDirs()
      Dim sBuf As String
      Dim cSize As Long
      Dim retval As Long
      sBuf = String(255, 0)
      cSize = 255

      ' Get Windows Directory.
      retval = GetWindowsDirectoryA(sBuf, cSize)
      sBuf = Left(sBuf, retval)
      Debug.Print sBuf

      ' Get System Directory.
      sBuf = String(255, 0)
      cSize = 255
      retval = GetSystemDirectoryA(sBuf, cSize)
      sBuf = Left(sBuf, retval)
      Debug.Print sBuf
   End Sub

</PRE>If the Debug window is not visible, then while in the Visual Basic for
Applications Editor, on the View menu, click Immediate Window (or Debug
Window).
