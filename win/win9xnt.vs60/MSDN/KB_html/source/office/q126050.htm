The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, version 4.3c-CD
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information describes how to install Microsoft Office and
Bookshelf, version 4.3c-CD, using a method that saves 12 megabytes (MB) of
disk space on your hard drive. The following method does not cause any loss
of functionality.
<P>
Note that the following method assumes that you are installing Microsoft
Office to your hard disk drive, and that you are installing the Clip Art
files. This method does not save disk space if you do not install the Clip
Art files.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>Install Microsoft Office from the Office and Bookshelf CD using
   the desired installation option, making sure to install all of the
   Clip Art files. The Clip Art files are a Shared Application setup
   option.

<P><LI>After Setup is complete, use a text editor such as Notepad to open
   the ARTGALRY.INI file. This file is located in your Microsoft Windows
   directory.

<P><LI>Locate the [Import] section, and change all the references that
   specify &lt;drive&gt;\msoffice\clipart\pcsfiles to &lt;CD-ROM drive&gt;:\pcsfiles,
   where &lt;drive&gt;\msoffice is the drive and directory to which you
   installed Microsoft Office, and &lt;CD-ROM drive&gt; is your CD-ROM drive.
   Make sure that the Office Disk 1 CD is still in the drive.

<P><LI>Using File Manager, delete all of the files located in the
   msoffice\clipart\pcsfiles directory on your local hard drive.

<P><LI>Run an application that supports OLE, for example, Microsoft Write.
   From the Edit menu, choose Insert Object, and select Microsoft
   ClipArt Gallery, and choose OK.

<P><LI>Choose Yes to add clipart from Microsoft Office.
<P>
</OL>When you have completed these steps, all of your clipart files are
available from the Disk 1 CD. Note that when you use this procedure, the
Microsoft Office Disk 1 CD must be in the CD-ROM drive in order to access
the clipart files.
