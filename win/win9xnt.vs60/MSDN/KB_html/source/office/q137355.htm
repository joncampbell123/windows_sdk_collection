The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Word for Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 5.1, 5.1a, 6.0, 6.0.1
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes differences between OLE 1.0 and OLE 2.0 as seen in
Word versions 5.x (which use OLE 1.0), Word versions 6.0 and 6.0.1 (which
use OLE 2.0), and Microsoft Excel versions 5.x (which use OLE 2.0).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Inserting Objects</h3>
 
<P>
Objects can be inserted in both Word 5.x and Microsoft Excel 5.x by
clicking Object on the Insert menu and selecting the desired object. In
Word 5.x, a collection of both Word and Microsoft Excel's available objects
appears in the dialog box. In Microsoft Excel 5.x, only Word 5.x's objects
will appear because Microsoft Excel's objects are built into the program.
<P>
<P><h3>Linking Objects</h3>
 
<P>
Links can be created by selecting and copying some information and then
clicking Paste Special on the Edit menu and then clicking Paste Link in the
dialog box.
<P>
When you link information between programs that use different versions,
characteristics of the link are dictated by the version of OLE in the
destination program.
<P>
<P><h2>OLE 2 ENHANCEMENTS</h2>
 
<P>
The following list documents the features that are present in OLE 2.0 that
are unavailable in OLE 1.0 programs:

<UL><LI>OLE drag and drop editing between programs

<LI>In-place editing

<LI>OLE automation/complex DDE

<LI>Automatic re-establishment of links - In Microsoft Excel 5.x and Word 6,
   when a source file is moved or renamed, the program will attempt to
   relocate the source file either through the Open dialog box or
   automatically. In Word 5.x (OLE 1.0), when a source file is renamed or
   moved, the link is broken and links must be reset manually by editing
   the link options.

<LI>Ability to link embedded OLE 2.0 objects

<LI>Link to file - When you insert a complete file or a picture via the
   Insert menu, there is an option to link to the source file. This is not
   an option in Word 5.x.

<LI>Updating multiple links at once - Links in Word 6.0 are inserted using
   fields. These can then be selected all at once and updated
   simultaneously.
<P>
</UL><h2>Additional OLE Servers</h2>
 
<P>
Word 6.0 comes with several new OLE 2.0 servers including:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Equation 2.0

<LI>Microsoft Movie

<LI>Microsoft Voice Annotation

<LI>Microsoft Word 6.0 Document

<LI>Microsoft Word 6.0 Picture

<LI>Microsoft WordArt 2.0
<P>
</UL>These servers can be used in both Microsoft Excel 5.x and Word 6.0.
<P>
Word 5.x contains earlier implementations of some of these servers, three
of which are plug-in modules (Voice Annotation, Movie, and Picture). These
plug-in modules are available only in Word, and, therefore, they cannot be
accessed by clicking the Object command on the Insert menu in Microsoft
Excel 5.x. Because Microsoft Graph 3.0 is an OLE 1.0 program and is
installed with Word 5.x, it will be available to both Word 5.x and
Microsoft Excel 5.x.
<P>
In OLE 1.0, OLE commands are handled by the programs themselves. With
OLE 2.0, programs use the Microsoft OLE extension which is
located in the Extensions folder. This modular design in OLE 2.0 places
less burden on the program.
