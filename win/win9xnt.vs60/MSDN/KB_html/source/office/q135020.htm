The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, versions 4.2.1-CD, 4.2.1a-CD
<LI>Microsoft Works for the Macintosh versions 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0b
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to install Microsoft Office for the Macintosh using
version 4.2.1-CD or 4.2.1a-CD, you may encounter various error messages or
your computer may hang (stop responding). In all of these cases you are
unable to complete Setup.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are trying to install Microsoft Office using version 4.2.1-CD or
4.2.1a-CD, you may experience one or more of the following problems:

<UL><LI>You never get the first Setup screen and your computer hangs.

<LI>You receive the either of the following error messages:
<P>
<P><PRE>      There is not enough memory to open 'Microsoft Office Setup'
      (zero K needed, zero K available). To make more memory available
      try quitting &lt;application&gt;.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      There is not enough memory available to continue execution of
      Setup. Try increasing Setup's memory partition, and then run
      Setup again.
</PRE>
<LI>After Setup begins copying files to your hard disk, you get a dialog
   box with the message
<P>
<P><PRE>      Please insert the next installation disk &lt;diskn&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where "diskn" is one of the Setup disks.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around these problems, use any of the following methods:
<P>
<PRE>Method 1:   Contact your CD-ROM manufacturer to see if you have the latest
            version of their CD-ROM driver. If you don't have the latest
            driver, obtain a copy and try running Setup for Microsoft
            Office after you have installed it.

Method 2:   If you are in a networked environment, see if there is another
            CD-ROM drive on the network from which Microsoft Office has
            been successfully set up from CD. If there is such a drive,
            share it, connect to that shared CD-ROM drive from your
            computer, then run Microsoft Office Setup from the shared
            drive.

            NOTE: If you are unfamiliar with the procedure for sharing a
            drive over a network, please refer to your operating system
            documentation or call the Apple support line at (800)-SOS-APPL.

Method 3:   If you are in a networked environment, see if there is another
            CD-ROM drive on the network from which Microsoft Office has
            been successfully set up from CD. If there is such a drive,
            perform an administrative Setup of Microsoft Office to a server
            drive, and then from your computer, connect to this server and
            run Setup from the administrative installation.

Method 4:   Follow these steps:

            1. Copy the file "Microsoft Office Setup" from the
               "Install Disk 1" folder on the CD to your hard drive.

            2. Reset the preferred size of the "Microsoft Office Setup"
               program that you just copied to your hard drive to a value
               higher than what is displayed in the "Get Info" window.

            3. Drag the file "Microsoft Office Setup Table" from the
               "Setup" folder in the "Install Disk 1" folder on the CD and
               place it on top of the icon for the file "Microsoft Office
               Setup" that you placed on your hard drive in step 1.

            4. Let go of your mouse button as you drag this file on top of
               the "Microsoft Office Setup" icon on your hard drive.

            The Office setup program will start as if you had launched it
            directly from the CD, but the setup program will have more
            memory allocated to it.

Method 5:   Ask Microsoft Technical Support to send you Microsoft Office
            version 4.2.1 on disks and run Setup from the disks.

Method 6:   Move the PPC Registration Database, Registration Database and
            Embedding Preferences files from the Preferences folder in the
            System Folder to the desktop and rerun setup.
