   5. Last Minute Updates

   1. NETWORK INSTALLATION WIZARD LIMITATIONS

      The Network Installation Wizard is designed as a tool to
      modify generic STF files but has been tailored for use with
      the Office 95 STF. It should only be used with the Office 95
      STF file.

   1.1  Custom Entries

        The Include Additional Entries feature in the Network
        Installation Wizard allows you to add custom files and
        custom registration entries to the installation.

   1.1.1  Custom Files

           - Using the Network Installation Wizard, you can add a
             maximum of 84 files to the setup process.
           - If new files are added, you must replace the original Inf
             file with the new Inf file for Setup to find the
             additional files.
           - All custom files must be in the Custom subfolder of the
             administrative installation. If any custom file is not in
             that folder, Setup will generate an error.
           - The destination you specify when adding a custom file is
             hard coded in the STF file.

   1.1.2  Custom Registration Entries

           - The only verification made on a custom registration entry
             is ensuring that a key is provided. When using the
             wizard, it is imperative that you verify spelling and
             content. USE CAUTION - IMPROPER REGISTRY ENTRIES CAN
             CAUSE WINDOWS 95 TO FAIL.
           - Setup can only modify registration entries that are
             String or DWORD types; Binary type values cannot be
             modified during an installation.

   1.2  Application Launching Options

        This dialog box only lists the links that are created when
        installing on a Windows NT workstation. If you choose to not
        install a specific link, or if you select the Install No
        Links option, this will affect only the links created on
        Windows NT. The shortcuts created on the Start menu by Office
        95 applications can be modified by the Configure Shortcut
        Installation Options item in the Office Options dialog box of
        the Wizard.

   1.3  Office Options

        These options can be grouped into three types: setting
        locations, setting other default values, and minimizing
        footprints for a Workstation Installation.

   1.3.1  Setting locations

          By default, the locations defined in the STF file for these
          items are specified as relative paths. The actual locations
          where the files are installed on disk are determined during
          installation using such factors as the folder specified by
          the user for Office and the user's current drive letter
          mappings.

          If you define a location for one of these settings, then
          that location will be specified in the STF file exactly as
          you enter it, including any drive letter given. Therefore,
          we recommend that you not change these default locations
          unless you are certain that all your users have consistent
          drive letter mappings and can use the same absolute paths
          for these files.

          If you select an item and then click the Edit Selection
          button, the wizard will propose a location for that item.
          You can keep the proposed path or modify it. If you click
          OK, the given absolute path will be written to the STF
          file. These locations can be modified by the end user after
          installation in the same way the end user would normally
          change default locations.

   1.3.2  Setting default values

          These items allow you to preset the default settings for
          certain features.

   1.3.3  Minimizing footprints
          Warning: These options have undergone some testing,
          but it is possible that situations may exist in
          which these options will fail. If any of these
          changes cause a problem such as a file not being
          found, open and modify the original STF file with
          the Network Installation Wizard, except without
          setting this specific option, and then reinstall
          Office.

          You should also be aware of possible contention
          issues that may arise if you allow write access to
          templates shared by multiple users over a network.
          If an Office application allows two users to open a
          template file simultaneously, then if both users
          both attempt to modify the file at the same time,
          only the changes written by the last user to write
          to the file will be saved. If the application opens
          the template exclusively, then the first user to
          open the file will succeed and others will not be
          allowed to open the file.

          Additional Notes:

           - In an environment where the applications are shared over
             the network, an additional five MB of files that are not
             System files may be installed locally for each user by
             default. Depending on the specific item, the Network
             Installation Wizard may give you the option of using the
             files over the network or not installing them.
           - Minimized PowerPoint - The Network Installation Wizard
             allows the administrator to move the PowerPoint PPA
             (wizard) files from the local machine to a shared
             location on the network.
           - Minimized Office Shortcut Bar  - All files can be shared,
             but for individual flexibility the Toolbar root location
             is kept local so the links can be created, removed, or
             modified by the end user. This requires typically less
             than 10KB of disk space by default.  See the Last Minute
             Update 5.1c below for additional information
           - Minimized Find Fast - The initial footprint of Find Fast
             is small (less than 100KB) but the indexes it generates
             can grow to 3-5% of the size of the documents being
             indexed. The benefit of having Find Fast on the local
             machine is increased performance in searching for
             documents; however, some administrators may choose to
             trade performance for space by not installing Find Fast.

   2. CREATING A SHORTCUT FOR USERS TO RUN SETUP

      An easy way for users to access the modified setup is to use
      a shortcut that you've created and distributed to them. You
      can create a shortcut to the setup file with the command
      line parameter to run installation in quiet mode, as well as
      with any additional command line parameters needed. This
      will ensure that users get the default options you have
      specified. Quiet mode runs setup using the default options
      set by the Network Installation Wizard. For more information
      on quiet mode, see Chapter 9, "Customizing Client
      Installations" in the Office Resource Kit.

      To create a shortcut to the correct setup:

       1. Rename the original setup.stf to something else, such as
          oldsetup.stf.

       2. Open oldsetup.stf with the Network Installation Wizard and set
          the options you want.

       3. Save these changes to a file named setup.stf.

       4. Create a shortcut to setup.exe in the same folder. For
          information about creating Windows 95 shortcuts, see the
          Windows 95 Help.

       5. After the shortcut to setup.exe is created, point to it and
          click the right mouse button. On the Shortcut menu, click
          Properties.

       6. Click the Shortcut tab.

       7. The Target box should contain a path to setup.exe. Add the
          command line parameter '/Q' to the end of this line along with
          any other parameters you need (/Q runs setup in quiet mode).
          Click OK.

      The shortcut created will now run setup in quiet mode. This shortcut
      can be renamed to anything you want, such as "Office 95 Setup for the
      Support Group" or "Setup for Executive Assistants".

   3. TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS

       - If you have problems using the Network Installation
         Wizard, delete all left over files in the Temp directory,
         restart Windows to clear memory, and then try again.

       - Be sure you have at least 2-3 MB available in your Temp
         area for the work files that the wizard will create.

   4. FOR MORE INFORMATION

      Chapter 9, "Customizing Client Installations," in the Office
      Resource Kit.

      LAST MINUTE UPDATES

      Known issues with this release of the Network Installation
      Wizard are listed below. You can identify the release by the size of
      the executable "Network Installation Wizard.exe" or NIW.EXE.

       Versions  Dates                Executable Sizes
       1.0       09/13/95             313979
       1.0a      December TechNet CD
       1.0b      11/05/95             319099
       1.1       03/28/96             332155

   5.1  Office Options

   5.1a  "Minimize Footprint of Access Briefcase Replication"
         "Briefcase replication" is not an accurate description of
         the Office Option referencing replication. The 228K
         file is not used by Windows 95 Briefcase replication, but it is
         used for conflict resolution for any type of Access database
         replication conflict. Without this file installed, problems would
         arise on any OS that does not have the "Briefcase" utility. This
         file needs to be present for any users who will be using
         replicated databases.  See 5.2a of this README.

   5.1b  Minimized Office Shortcut Bar.
         If this option is used the administrator must do either of the
         following.

           Either:
              Copy the file MSOW.EXE from the
              &lt;Admin Install&gt;\OS\SYSTEM directory to the
              &lt;Admin Install&gt;\OFFICE directory
           or
               Run the first client install with full Read/Write access
               to the &lt;Admin Install&gt;\OFFICE directory so that Setup
               can copy the file there.

         If this is not done, buttons using this file will not function
         properly and the icons may show generic icons
         (e.g. Open a Document, Answer Wizard)

   5.2   Corrections\Additions\Changes

   5.2a  Some Office Options would ignore the 'Yes/No' value.
         The following options would always perform the 'Yes' option
         whenever they were viewed and 'OK' was selected instead
         of 'Cancel'.

          "Minimize Footprint of Access Briefcase Replication"
          "Prevent Bookshelf '95 integration"
          "Prevent the addition of the Office Compatible button"

         This was corrected as of Version 1.0b

   5.2b  Changes to the Word Document File Location were being written to
         an invalid registry key. This was corrected as of Version 1.1.

   5.2c  The NIW would automatically delete any pre-existing NEWSETUP.STF
         if 'cancel' was selected during an editing session. This was
         corrected as of Version 1.1. Reference KnowledgeBase article
         <B><A href="../office/q145569.htm">Q145569</A></B>.

   5.2d  When you run the NIW and select a Microsoft Office for Windows 95,
         version 7.0a,(Standard or Professional edition) Setup.stf in the
         File Open dialog box, the file appears to load completely followed
         by the following error message:

          ''Isn't an index in this table''

         Reference KnowledgeBase article <B><A href="../office/q148303.htm">Q148303</A></B>. This was corrected as
         of Version 1.1.

   5.2e  The NIW would previously perform only the last directory change
         made in the component selection section. This was corrected as
         of Version 1.1.

   5.2f  The NIW now supports the removal of Schedule Plus 7.0 from the
         Office 95 setup. This affects all installation types. This is
         available as of Version 1.1.

   5.2g  The NIW now provides an option for correcting the failure of a
         Run-From-Server installation to an IBM LanServer box.
         Reference KnowledgeBase article <B><A href="../office/q147127.htm">Q147127</A></B>. This is available as
         of Version 1.1.

   5.2h  The support for command line switches '/enhanced' and '/edlin'
         have been removed as of Version 1.1.

   5.2I  The NIW now supports the use of a universal naming convention
         (UNC) path to select the location of the .stf file. Reference
         KnowledgeBase article <B><A href="../office/q142980.htm">Q142980</A></B>. This is available as of Version
         1.1.
