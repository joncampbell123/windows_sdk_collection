<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to insert a tagged image file format (TIFF) image in a
document you created in the products listed at the beginning of this
article, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   An error occurred while importing the file &lt;File name&gt;.

</PRE>Where &lt;File name&gt; is the name of the document.
<P>
In addition, if you attempt to open the image in Microsoft Photo Editor,
the following message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Can't open file.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the TIFF image contains a grayscale image and two
extra samples, called alpha channels. The Microsoft TIFF import filter
reads only the greyscale image; it does not read multiple alpha channels.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.
<P>
Method 1. Open the TIFF image in the program in which it was created.
<PRE>          Either delete the extra channels or "split" the image into
          three separate channels, and then resave the file as a TIFF
          image.

</PRE>Method 2. If you do not have the program in which the image was created,
<PRE>          but you have another graphics program, open the image in that
          program, and then save the image in one of the graphics formats
          supported by the products listed at the beginning of this
          article.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for
Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
