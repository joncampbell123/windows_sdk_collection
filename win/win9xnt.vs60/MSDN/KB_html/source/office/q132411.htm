The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office version 7.0 over an existing version of
Microsoft Office, the MSAPPS folder from the existing version of Office is
not removed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because the Microsoft Office version 7.0 Setup program
cannot detect which shared applications are safe to remove from an existing
version of Microsoft Office. Because the shared applications are used by
applications other than the Office applications, it is not safe for the
Microsoft Office version 7.0 Setup program to remove them.
<P>
Because Microsoft Office version 7.0 installs the shared applications to
the PROGRAM FILES\COMMON FILES\MICROSOFT SHARED folder, instead of the
MSAPPS folder, you may have multiple versions of the following shared
applications on your computer:
<P>
<PRE>   Equation Editor
   WordArt
   Graph
   Organization Chart
   Clipart Gallery
   Graphic filters
   Microsoft Query
   Microsoft Info
   Proofing Tools
   Text Converters

</PRE>Note that this behavior does not affect the functionality of the shared
applications or your Microsoft applications. The newest version of the
applications are registered in Windows, and these are the versions that are
run when you use the shared application. However, the duplication of files
uses up disk space on your computer.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid having multiple versions of the same shared applications on your
computer, use any of the following methods.
<P>
Method 1: Before you install Microsoft Office version 7.0 over a previous
<PRE>          version of Office, run the Setup program for the previous version
          of Microsoft Office in maintenance mode, and choose Remove All to
          remove the shared applications that were installed by that
          version of Office.

</PRE>Method 2: To remove the older version of a shared application that is in
<PRE>          multiple locations on your computer, do the following:

          a. Run Microsoft Explorer or My Computer.

          b. Locate the MSAPPS folder in the Microsoft Windows folder.

          c. Click the folder in the MSAPPS folder for the application that
             you want to remove, and press DELETE. Repeat this step for
             each shared application that you want to remove.
