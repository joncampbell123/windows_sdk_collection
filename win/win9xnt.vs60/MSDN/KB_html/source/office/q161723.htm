The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Project 98 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT, versions 3.51, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
On Microsoft Windows NT, when you attempt to run one of the Microsoft
Office programs listed at the beginning of this article, the following
error appears and the program does not run:
<P>
<PRE>   The dynamic link library MSO97.DLL could not be found in the
   specified path
   C:\Excel;.;C:\Winnt\System32;C:\Winnt\System;C:\Winnt;.

</PRE>NOTE: The paths to the individual programs will differ depending on where
you installed them.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem will occur if both of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You ran the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program, and selected Custom
   installation with the following options:
<P>
   Microsoft Access
   Data Access
   Office Tools
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You ran the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program again, selected another
   Microsoft Office program (such as Microsoft Excel) and installed it
   to a location different from the other Microsoft Office programs.
<P>
</UL>For example, you will receive the error message if you install Microsoft
Access in the "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office" folder and then
run Setup again and install Microsoft Excel in the "C:\Excel" folder.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, add the path of the Mso97.dll file to the
operating system's environment search path. The Mso97.dll file should be
located in the Office folder in the folder in which you installed the
Microsoft Office 97 programs, for example "C:\Program Files\Microsoft
Office\Office." To locate Mso97.dll, search your hard disk using Windows
Explorer or click the Start button on the taskbar, point to Find, and then
click Files Or Folders.
<P>
To add the Mso97.dll path to your Microsoft Windows NT system environment
path, use the appropriate procedure for your version of Windows NT.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft NT 4.0</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.
   Double-click the System icon and then click the Environment tab.

<P><LI>Under System Variables, click Path.

<P><LI>In the Value box, append the path to Mso97.dll to the existing
   path. For example, if Mso97.dll is located in the default folder,
   for example "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office," after you add
   this path, the Value box would appear as
<P>
<P><PRE>      %SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;C:\Program Files\Microsoft
      Office\Office;
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: Be sure to add a trailing semicolon after the path. Failing to
   do so will cause problems when other programs append to this path.

<P><LI>Click Set, click Apply, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL><h3>Microsoft NT 3.51</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>In Program Manager, open the Main group. Double-click Control Panel and
   then double-click the System icon.

<P><LI>Under System Environment Variables, click Path.

<P><LI>In the Value box, append the path to Mso97.dll to the existing
   path. For example, if Mso97.dll is located in the default folder,
   for example "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office," after you add
   this path, the Value box would appear as
<P>
<P><PRE>      %SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;C:\Program Files\Microsoft
      Office\Office;
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: Be sure to add a trailing semicolon after the path. Failing to
   do so will cause problems when other programs append to this path.

<P><LI>Click Set, and then click OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
