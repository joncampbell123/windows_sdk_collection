The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, version 4.2
<LI>Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In any of the Microsoft Office for the Macintosh programs, you may be able
to print a cover page with your document. By default, there is no cover
page printed, but you can choose to have one printed before or after your
document. One of the things printed on the cover page is your user name.
This is a nice feature when you print on a network printer--when a document
is printed this way it's easy to distinguish your documents from other
users' documents.
<P>

<P><h3>How to Print a Cover Page</h3>
 
<P>
When you print a document from any of the applications listed at the
beginning of this article, you do not get a cover page printed with the
document. This is the default setting. To print a cover page with your
document, follow these steps:
<P>
<P><h3>Using LaserWriter 8.x printer driver</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Click Print on the File menu.

<P><LI>Select "Cover page" in the General drop down.

<P><LI>Select either Before Document or After Document in the "Print Cover
   Page" group.

<P><LI>Click Print.
<P>
</OL>Your document should be printed with a cover page and the cover page should
include many items, including your User Name.
<P>
<P><h3>Using LaserWriter 7.2 printer driver</h3>
 
1. Click Print on the File menu.

<OL><P><LI>In the Print dialog box, click Options.

<P><LI>In the Print Options dialog box, choose either Before or After Document
   for the Cover Page.

<P><LI>Click OK.

<P><LI>Click Print.
<P>
</OL>Your document should be printed with a cover page and the cover page should
include many items, including your User Name.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Specify a User Name</h3>
 
<P>
If the User Name portion of the cover page is blank, use the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>From the Apple menu, choose Control Panels.

<P><LI>In the Control Panels dialog box, double-click the Sharing Setup icon.

<P><LI>In the Sharing Setup dialog box, in the Owner Name box, type the
   User Name that you would like to appear on the cover page. (You can also
   specify an Owner Password and a Macintosh Name in this dialog box, but
   this information is not required.)

<P><LI>Close Sharing Setup dialog box.

<P><LI>To make sure your user name has been detected by the network, choose
   Control Panels from the Apple menu, and then select the User's &amp; Groups
   control panel.
<P>
   In the User's &amp; Groups control panel, you should, see a minimum of two
   icons, one with the user name you entered in the Sharing Setup dialog
   box, and the other should be "Guest."

<P><LI>If you see an icon with your user name, close the User's &amp; Groups
   window, and repeat steps 1 through 6 from the section on Printing a
   Cover Page.
<P>
   NOTE: If you do not see an icon with the user name you entered in the
   Sharing Setup dialog box, repeat steps 1 through 6. If it still fails,
   see your System documentation for more information.
