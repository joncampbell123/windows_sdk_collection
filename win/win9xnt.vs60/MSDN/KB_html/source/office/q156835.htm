The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Access 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform a complete installation of Microsoft Office 97, not all of
the included ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) drivers are installed.
Specifically, the following ODBC drivers are not installed:
<P>
<PRE>   Paradox Driver
   Lotus 1-2-3 Driver
   Exchange Driver
   SQL Server Driver

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This occurs because some drivers have been moved from the main Microsoft
Office 97 Setup program into the Microsoft Data Access Pack, included in
the Microsoft Office Value Pack. A separate Setup program must be run in
order to install these drivers.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To install the aforementioned ODBC drivers, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Insert your Microsoft Office 97 disc into your CD-ROM drive, or, if
   you installed Microsoft Office 97 from a network server, connect to
   the network server.

<P><LI>On the Start menu, click Run. Type the following command line:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;X&gt;:\Valupack\Dataacc\Dataacc.exe
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;X&gt; is the letter of your CD-ROM drive. Or, type the path
   that points to the Dataacc.exe file on your network server.
<P>
   Then, click OK.

<P><LI>Click Yes to install the Microsoft Data Access Pack.

<P><LI>When the Data Access Setup dialog box appears, click Continue. If you
   are warned that the Data Access Pack has already been installed, click
   Continue.

<P><LI>Click OK to allow the Setup program to copy the data access files to
   the C:\Program Files\Data Access folder. Or, click "Change Folder" to
   specify a different path, and then click OK.

<P><LI>Click "Complete\Custom Install".

<P><LI>Click "Change Option". In the next dialog box, select the checkbox for
   each driver you want to install.

<P><LI>Click OK and then click Continue.

<P><LI>When Setup has copied all the files, you should receive the message
  "Data Access Pack Setup was completed successfully." Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Data Access Pack included with Microsoft Office 97 includes
several different ODBC drivers. The following table lists these drivers and
whether or not they are installed when you perform a complete installation
of Microsoft Office:
<P>
<PRE>                                         Installed With a
   Driver                             Complete Office Install
   ----------------------------------------------------------

   Microsoft Access Driver                      yes
   Microsoft Excel Driver                       yes
   Microsoft Text and HTML Driver               yes
   Microsoft xBase Driver                       yes
   Exchange Driver                              no
   Paradox Driver                               no
   Lotus 1-2-3 Driver                           no
   SQL Server Driver                            no


</PRE></OL>The first four drivers listed in the table above are installed during a
complete setup of Microsoft Office 97, but are also included in the Data
Access Pack. The last three drivers listed in the above table are included
only in the Data Access Pack.
<P>
Because the drivers in the Data Access Pack are installed by a separate
Setup program, it is not possible to incorporate these drivers into an
administrative installation ("setup /a") of Microsoft Office 97. You must
run the Dataacc.exe program to install the additional drivers.
