The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, version 4.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you choose Setup And Uninstall from Microsoft Office Manager (MOM),
and you select the application Microsoft Office, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The data files required to launch Setup could not be found. To perform
   maintenance on this installation, please launch Setup from either your
   original product disks, or the shared network location from which you
   originally installed.

</PRE>If you choose Exit Setup, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup was not completed successfully.

</PRE>Additionally, the Microsoft Office Setup icon may not appear in your
Microsoft Office folder.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs after you perform a Minimum installation of Microsoft
Office, because the Setup program is not installed. This means that you
cannot run Setup from a folder on your hard drive, or from the Microsoft
Office Manager (MOM) because the necessary Setup files do not exist on your
hard drive.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, use any of the following methods:
<P>
<PRE>Method 1:   To run Setup, run the Setup program again from your original
            installation disks or from the network server that you
            installed from.

Method 2:   If you installed Microsoft Office from a network server, do the
            following to add a Microsoft Office Setup option to MOM:

            a. From the Microsoft Office Manager, choose Customize.

            b. In the Microsoft Office Manager dialog box, choose the New
               button.

            c. Select the network server and directory that you installed
               from. Then select Microsoft Office Setup from the list of
               Office files on the server.

            d. Choose Add. Close the Microsoft Office Manager dialog box.

</PRE>The Microsoft Office Setup option is added to your Microsoft Office
Manager. If you use this method, you must have a persistent connection to
the network server in order to run Setup from MOM.
<P>
<PRE>Method 3:   To install the Setup files, do the following:

            a. Run Setup again from your original installation disks, or
               from the network server from which you installed.

            b. Choose the Add/Remove button.

            c. In the Components Not Yet Installed list, click the triangle
               next to Tools to display a list of Tools options.

            d. Clear the check box next to any items under Tools that you
               do NOT want to install. Make sure that the check box next to
               Setup is selected. Choose Continue.
