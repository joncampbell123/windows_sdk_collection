The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you install Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition on your computer,
the following files may appear in the Trash:
<P>
<PRE>   Arial
   Times New Roman
   Wingdings
   Microsoft Office Manager

</PRE>NOTE: Other fonts may also appear in the Trash. You are not notified during
installation that the files are being moved to the Trash.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition includes new versions of the Arial,
Times New Roman, and Wingdings fonts, and new versions of some less
commonly used fonts.
<P>
If older versions of these fonts are found on the computer when you install
Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition, the old fonts are moved to the Trash
and are replaced by the new fonts.
<P>
If you have Microsoft Office Manager from Microsoft Office 4.2 and you run
the Office 98 Installer, a new copy of the Microsoft Office Manager is
copied to your Control Panels folder. The old copy is moved to the Trash
and you have to manually empty the Trash to get rid of it.
<P>
The Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition installation program is not
designed to remove the old files from the Trash after the installation
process is completed. As a result, the old files appear in the Trash. This
may lead you to believe that the fonts and Microsoft Office Manager are not
available for use on your computer.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If this behavior occurs, empty the Trash by clicking Empty Trash on the
Special menu.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of the Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition
installation program.
