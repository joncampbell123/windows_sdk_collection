The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
During the installation of Microsoft Office, after all files are copied,
the Setup program displays the message:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup is updating your system files

</PRE>and stops responding.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This may occur if all of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You are on a computer running Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Server.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You are performing a normal installation ("setup") of Microsoft Office,
   either from another server or from a CD-ROM. You are NOT performing
   an administrative installation ("setup /a").
<P>
   -and-

<LI>The computer has the Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS)
   services installed and running.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, turn off the IIS services before
you run Microsoft Office Setup. To do this, use the following steps:
<P>
<PRE>   1. On the Start menu, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.

   2. Double-click Services.

   3. In the list of services, click "World Wide Web Publishing Service".
      Click Stop.

   4. When asked if you are sure you want to stop the service, click Yes.

   5. Click Close, and then close the Control Panel window.

</PRE>After Microsoft Office Setup is complete, you can turn the services back
on:
<P>
<PRE>   1. On the Start menu, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.

   2. Double-click Services.

   3. In the list of services, click "World Wide Web Publishing Service",
      then click Start.

   4. Click Close, and then close the Control Panel window.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem has been corrected in
Microsoft Office 97 for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs only when you install Microsoft Office on a Windows NT
4.0 Server that is non-dedicated: that is, the computer also serves as a
workstation. The error does NOT occur when you perform an administrative
installation of Microsoft Office from a workstation onto a Windows NT 4.0
Server.
