</PRE><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Office versions 4.2 and 4.3 for Windows, the Setup
program does not recognize Microsoft PowerPoint(R) version 4.0 or
Microsoft Excel version 5.0 as valid applications for upgrading. This
problem occurs because the compliance checker (COMPLINC.DLL) that
ships with these versions of Microsoft Office only recognizes
Microsoft Word version 6.0 for Windows, the only application that
shipped on disk in Microsoft Office version 4.0.
<P>
The disk provided with this Application Note contains an updated
COMPLINC.DLL file. You can use this updated file to complete the Setup
program for international English versions of Microsoft Office when
you are upgrading from Microsoft PowerPoint version 4.0 or Microsoft
Excel version 5.0. This replacement file correctly detects the
PowerPoint 4.0 or Microsoft Excel 5.0 files on your hard disk and
allows you to complete the Microsoft Office Setup.
<P>
NOTE: The updated COMPLINC.DLL will not recognize the files on the
Microsoft PowerPoint 4.0 or Microsoft Excel 5.0 floppy disk (Disk 1)
as valid for upgrading. You will need to install one of these
applications on your hard disk in order to successfully complete the
Microsoft Office Setup.
<P>
If you are running the Setup program for the U.S. version of Microsoft
Office, you do not need to use the disk provided with this Application
Note. Although you do receive an error message when you install the
U.S. (domestic) versions of Microsoft Office, you can continue with
the Setup program and successfully install Microsoft Office, even if
you do not provide the requested verification.
<P>
<P><h3>To replace the COMPLINC.DLL file</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Make a backup copy of your Microsoft Office Disk 1 (copy its
   contents to a new floppy disk).

<P><LI>Insert the enclosed WC1032 disk in your floppy disk drive.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS prompt, type the following and press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;:\complinc.dll &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the WC1032 disk
   and &lt;destination&gt; is a directory to which you can copy the
   COMPLINC.DLL file temporarily. For example, if the name of the
   directory is C:\FILES and the  WC1032 disk is in drive A, type the
   following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\complinc.dll c:\files
</PRE>
<P><LI>Insert the backup copy of your Microsoft Office Disk 1 in your
   floppy disk drive.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS prompt, type the following and press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;source&gt;\complinc.dll &lt;drive&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;source&gt;is the drive and directory you copied the
   COMPLINC.DLL file to in step 3, and &lt;drive&gt; is the drive that
   contains the backup copy of your Microsoft Office Disk 1. For
   example, if the name of the drive and directory is C:\FILES and the
   backup copy of your Microsoft Office Disk 1 is in drive A, type the
   following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy c:\files\complinc.dll a:
</PRE>
<P><LI>You can now run the Microsoft Office Setup program from the backup
   copy of your Microsoft Office Disk 1.
