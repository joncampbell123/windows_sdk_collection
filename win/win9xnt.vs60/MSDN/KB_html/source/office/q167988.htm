The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Access 97
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you drag, copy and paste, or cut and paste a control from a document in
one of the programs listed at the beginning of this article to a document
in another of the Office 97 programs (for example, from Microsoft Excel 97
to Microsoft Word 97), the following problems may occur:

<UL><LI>The control does not work when you click it. Instead, it is selected,
   and handles appear at its corners and edges.

<LI>When you right-click the control, some menu items do not appear on the
   shortcut menu, and other menu items that should not be present appear.
<P>
</UL>The extent to which these problems occur varies from program to program.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems occur because the programs listed at the beginning of this
article handle clipboard data differently when a control is dragged, copied
and pasted, or cut and pasted from one program to another. In particular,
you may notice that the dragged or pasted control acts like a drawing
object or an AutoShape instead of a control.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft PowerPoint 97</h3>
 
<P>
You can drag, copy and paste, or cut and paste a control from a different
program into a presentation in Microsoft PowerPoint 97 without any
problems. The control continues to work correctly, and all of the correct
menu items appear on the shortcut menu for the control.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Access 97</h3>
 
<P>
You can drag, copy and paste, or cut and paste a control from a different
program into a form in Microsoft Access 97 without any problems. The
control continues to work correctly, and all of the correct menu items
appear on the shortcut menu for the control.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Word 97</h3>
 
<P>
If you drag, copy and paste, or cut and paste a control from a
different program into a document in Microsoft Word 97, the following
problems may occur:

<UL><LI>If you right-click the control, the Properties and View Code menu items
   do not appear on the shortcut menu. Instead, the Show Picture Toolbar
   and Set AutoShape Defaults menu items appear.

<LI>If you click the control, the control does not work. Instead, it is
   selected.
<P>
</UL>To work around this problem, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>In the original program, copy the control.

<P><LI>Switch to Microsoft Word 97.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Paste Special.

<P><LI>In the Paste Special dialog box, click the first item in the As list
   box.
<P>
   Usually, the last word of the first item is "Control."

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>When you do this, the control works normally.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel 97</h3>
 
<P>
If you drag, copy and paste, or cut and paste a control from a different
program into a worksheet in Microsoft Excel 97, the following problems may
occur:

<UL><LI>If you right-click the control, the Properties and View Code menu items
   do not appear on the shortcut menu. Instead, the Show Picture Toolbar
   and Set AutoShape Defaults menu items appear.

<LI>If you click the control, the control does not work. Instead, it is
   selected.
<P>
</UL>Note that using the Paste Special dialog box to paste the control does not
prevent the problem from occurring when you click or right-click the pasted
control.
