<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, version 4.2.1b on compact disc, is now
being bundled with Microsoft Bookshelf 1996-97, a collection of business
tools, and a set of Internet-related programs. This enhanced version
replaces the standard version on compact disc and will not be available on
floppy disks. No special bundle will be available for the Academic Edition
of Microsoft Office for the Macintosh because that version already contains
Microsoft Bookshelf.
<P>
This enhanced version of Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, version
4.2.1b, contains two compact discs; disc 1 is the standard CD-ROM version
of Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, and disc 2 contains Bookshelf, the
business tools, and the Internet programs. You must run the Setup program
on each disc to install this version on your computer.

<P>
<P><h3>Disc 1</h3>
 
<P>
This disc contains the same CD-ROM version of Microsoft Office for the
Macintosh, version 4.2.1b, that shipped prior to the release of the bundled
version of Microsoft Office for the Macintosh.
<P>
The Setup program on disc 1 will only install the Microsoft Office
component programs (Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint,
the shared Office applications, and the Microsoft Office Manager). After
the disc 1 Setup is finished, run the Installer on disc 2.
<P>
<P><h3>Disc 2</h3>
 
<P>
This disc contains Bookshelf, the business tools, and the Internet-related
programs. To install these components, start the Installer (called "Install
Bookshelf and Tools") on disc 2, and follow the directions provided in the
installation windows.
<P>
The "Install Bookshelf and Tools" Installer is an integrated installation
program (for disc 2 only) that will install, by default, Microsoft
Bookshelf 1996-97, Microsoft QuickShelf, Business Tools and Templates for
Microsoft Office, Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.1, Microsoft Internet
Connection Wizard, Internet Config 1.3, Internet Assistant for Microsoft
Excel, Microsoft Office Manager 4.2.1c Updater, and supporting System
files.
<P>
The first window that appears after starting the Installer will default to
an "Easy Install," which will install all of the components on the compact
disc. You also have the option to perform a Custom Install, which will
allow you to select just the components you want to install. After choosing
either "Easy Install" or "Custom Install" click the Install button in this
first window. The install program will automatically copy all the required
files to your hard disk.
