<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOM</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Office Binder, version 7.0, if you attempt to open a binder
file (OBD) created by Microsoft Office Binder 97, you may receive the
following error message
<P>
<PRE>   The Binder file could not be loaded.
   This file cannot be read because it was created by an older version.

</PRE>and you cannot open the binder file in Microsoft Office Binder 7.0.
<P>
NOTE: The error message should actually read as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   The Binder file could not be loaded.
   This file cannot be read because it was created by a newer version.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Compatibility Between Microsoft Office Binder 7.0 and 97</h3>
 
<P>
Although Microsoft Office Binder 97 can open binder files stored in both
the Binder 7.0 and Binder 97 formats, it can only save binders in the
Binder 97 format, not in the Binder 7.0 format.
<P>
Because of this, it is not possible to open a binder saved by Microsoft
Office Binder 97 in Microsoft Office Binder 7.0.
<P>
If you have saved a binder in the Microsoft Office Binder 97 format and
need to reopen it in Microsoft Office Binder 7.0, open the binder file in
Microsoft Office Binder 97 and export each section of the binder in its
native file format. To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Activate the section you want to export.

<P><LI>On the Section menu, click View Outside.

<P><LI>Once the section is open in its source application, click Save As on
   the File menu. Save the section as a new file.
<P>
</OL>Repeat steps 1-3 for each section in your binder. Once all sections have
been exported, close all of your applications, including Microsoft Office
Binder 97. Then, start Microsoft Office Binder 7.0 and follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Section menu, click Add From File.

<P><LI>In the Add From File dialog box, select one of the files you exported.
   Click Add to add the file into your binder.
<P>
</OL>Repeat these steps for each file you need to add into the binder file. Once
all sections have been added, click Save Binder on the File menu to save
the binder in the Binder 7.0 format.
