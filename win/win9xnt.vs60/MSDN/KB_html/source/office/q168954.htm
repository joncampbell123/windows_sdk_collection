<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Small Business Edition (SBE) of Microsoft Office 97 includes a
collection of offers for 60 days of free World Wide Web site hosting. This
article explains how to find information concerning these offers on
Microsoft's Web site.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Corporation has formed agreements with several Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) in both the United States and Canada. If you are a
licensed user of the Office 97 SBE, you are eligible to receive 60 days of
free site hosting from one of these ISPs.
<P>
To find information concerning this offer, make sure that you are connected
to the Internet, either through an online service, an ISP, or through your
company's connection to the Internet. Then, perform the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Insert the Microsoft Office 97 SBE Compact Disc 1 into your computer's
   CD-ROM drive.

<P><LI>On the Office 97 SBE screen, click the ValuPack button.
<P>
   NOTE: If the screen does not appear, double-click Autorun.exe in the
</OL>root
<PRE>   folder of the Compact Disc. Then, click the ValuPack button.

</PRE><P><LI>On the "Welcome to the Microsoft Office 97 Small Business Edition
   ValuPack" screen, click "Doing Business On The Internet." that appears
</OL>at the
<PRE>   end of the third paragraph of text.

</PRE><P><LI>When the Doing Business On The Internet Web page appears, click the
   Get Connected link at the upper-left corner of the window.

<P><LI>Click the link labelled "So, Now What do I do?"

<P><LI>Click the "special offers from ISPs" link on the right-hand
   side of the window. This link appears in the "How do I find an ISP?"
   paragraph.
<P>
   NOTE: If you receive an error message when you click this link, try
   again. The Web page you are about to view is often very busy.
<P>
</OL>The "FREE Web Site Hosting Offers!" Web page will appear. You can click the
link for an ISP to view information about that ISP and the services they
provide.
