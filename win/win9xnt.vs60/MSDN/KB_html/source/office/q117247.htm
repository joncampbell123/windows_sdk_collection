</PRE><h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<P>
In the U.S. version of Microsoft Office 4.2 for Windows, when you
remove the Microsoft Word command from or change its location on the
Microsoft Office menu, the command appears in the original location
after you close and restart the Microsoft Office Manager (MOM).
<P>
The disk provided with this Application Note contains an updated
MSOFFICE.EXE file (MOM version 4.2c). In order to use this updated
version of MSOFFICE.EXE, you must currently be using MOM version 4.2b.
After you update MOM version 4.2b to MOM version 4.2c, you can remove
the Microsoft Word command from the Microsoft Office menu or change
its location on the Microsoft Office menu.
<P>
<P><h3>To find out which version of MOM you are using</h3>
 
<P>
If you received Microsoft Office version 4.2 as a complete disk set,
you are running MOM 4.2b. If you received the single MOM disk with a
product fulfillment update, choose About Microsoft Office from the
Office toolbar icon to check the version of MOM. If the version number
in the About Microsoft Office dialog box is 4.2 rather than 4.2b, you
need to receive the 4.2b update of MOM. To obtain this version of MOM,
call the Microsoft Sales Information Center at (800) 426-9400. After
you install the 4.2b update of MOM, you can then use the disk provided
with this Application Note to replace your MSOFFICE.EXE file.
<P>
<P><h3>To replace the MSOFFICE.EXE file</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>To close the Microsoft Office Manager, choose the Microsoft Office
   button from the MOM toolbar, and then choose Exit.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS prompt, type the following and press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      rename &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;directory&gt;\msoffice.exe msoffice.old
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; and &lt;directory&gt; are the drive and directory to which
   you installed Microsoft Office. For example, if you installed
   Microsoft Office on drive C in a directory called MSOFFICE, you
   would type the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      rename c:\msoffice\msoffice.exe msoffice.old
</PRE>
<P><LI>Insert the enclosed WC1038 disk in your floppy disk drive.

<P><LI>At the MS-DOS prompt, type the following and press ENTER
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy &lt;drive&gt;:\msoffice.exe &lt;destination&gt;
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;drive&gt; is the floppy disk drive containing the WC1038 disk
   and &lt;destination&gt; is the location of your Microsoft Office
   directory. For example, if WC1038 is in drive A, and if the
   location of your Microsoft Office directory is C:\MSOFFICE, type
   the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy a:\msoffice.exe c:\msoffice
</PRE><P>
</OL>You can now run the Microsoft Office Manager, and successfully move,
add, or remove any of the commands on the Microsoft Office menu. To
verify that the file has been updated, choose the Microsoft Office
toolbar icon, and then choose About Microsoft Office. The About
Microsoft Office dialog box should indicate that you are using version
4.2c.
<P>
NOTE: When you use the updated MSOFFICE.EXE, the opening screen for
Microsoft Office will not be customized with your name, and in the
About Microsoft Office dialog box, the serial number will contain Xs.
This change in customization does not affect your Microsoft Office
registration; the individual Microsoft Office applications still
contain the correct serial numbers for their respective products.
