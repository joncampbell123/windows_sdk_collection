<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information was published as part three of a five-part
series in the 1.9.94 issue of MacWeek.
<P>
<P><h2>TIPS AND TRICKS FOR MICROSOFT OFFICE VERSION 4.2</h2>
 
<P>
Dear Mac User:
<P>
This is part 3 of a five-part series on tips and tricks about
Microsoft Office Standard version 4.2 (which includes Microsoft Excel
5.0, Word 6.0, PowerPoint 4.0 and a Microsoft Mail 3.1 workstation
license). We hope you find this information useful as you upgrade
your organization to Microsoft Office 4.2.
<P>

</PRE><h2>PART 3:  POWER MACINTOSH PERFORMANCE</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Taking Advantage Of Power Macintosh Technology</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft uses the speed of Power Macintosh to make Microsoft Office
Standard version 4.2 programs work together more seamlessly and
naturally. Other Power Macintosh capabilities, especially the
enhanced memory model, make this process more efficient. Office
programs in native mode are generally two to four times faster than
those for 68K Macintosh.
<P>
MACINTOSH VS. POWER MACINTOSH SPEED

<P><h3>Make Sure You're Running the Right Version!</h3>
 
<P>
Power Macintosh native versions of Microsoft Excel, Word, PowerPoint
and Office 4.2 are shipped today at no charge with the 68K versions.
You must be running the native versions to see performance
improvements. Office 4.2 shipped last fall with only Microsoft Excel
native in the box.

<P><h3>What Affects the User's Computer Experience?</h3>
 
<P>
At Microsoft, our goal is to build the best software applications for
any given platform and leave the platform choice up to you. The
following are factors that will help explain the performance you're
experiencing on Power Macintosh:
<P>
- Chip architecture: RISC chips such as PowerPC perform floating-point
<PRE>   calculations faster, which is important for graphical programs but not
   for desktop productivity programs.

</PRE>- Computer Architecture: Increasing the flow of information to and from
<PRE>   the chip can have a strong impact. You can do this on Power Macintosh
   by installing a cache card and more RAM to minimize disk input/output.

</PRE>- Disk Speed: The speed of disk access on the first generation of Power
<PRE>   Macintosh is about the same as that on 68K Macintosh, so disk-intensive
   operations run about the same.

</PRE>- Operating System (OS) Optimization: System 7.5 is about 30 percent
<PRE>   native (in the most commonly used areas). As more of the OS becomes
   native, your Power Macintosh will get faster.

</PRE>- Program Optimization: Microsoft wrote a new, optimizing C compiler to
<PRE>   generate native code. Using C code is in line with Apple's
   recommendations. Some critical functions have been hand coded to speed
   up operation on both Intel and 68K CICS over the years, and Microsoft
   plans to implement such optimizations in RISC programs.

</PRE><h2>CUSTOMER'S TIP</h2>
 
<P>
"Given the impressive performance of the Power Mac version of
Microsoft Excel 5.0, our experience is that once the commitment is
made to Power Mac technology, the investment in Microsoft Excel is
very worthwhile. For instance, we're seeing significant performance
improvements in graphing, PivotTables, and the sorting function for
large data files."
