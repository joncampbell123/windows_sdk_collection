The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you successfully complete an installation of Microsoft Office version
7.0, the number of buttons on your Old Office toolbar, located on the
Office Shortcut Bar, may be fewer than you had on the Microsoft Office
Manager (MOM) prior to installing version 7.0.
<P>
In addition, the Office application buttons on MOM may run the version 7.0
Office applications rather than the earlier versions of your applications.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you want to have the same number of buttons on your Office Shortcut Bar
Old Office toolbar as you had on MOM, you need to manually customize the
Old Office toolbar. In order to customize the Old Office toolbar,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>While the Old Office toolbar is displayed, use the right mouse button to
   click the Office Shortcut Bar and click Customize on the shortcut menu.

<P><LI>Click the Buttons tab.

<P><LI>For each missing button, click the Add File button.

<P><LI>In the Add File dialog box, locate the application you want added
   to the Old Office toolbar, and then click the Add button.
<P>
</OL>If you want to have your Old Office toolbar buttons for the Office
applications start the Office version 4.0, 4.2, or 4.3 programs, do
the following:

<OL><P><LI>While the  Old Office toolbar is displayed, use the right mouse button
   to click the Office Shortcut Bar and click Customize on the shortcut
   menu.

<P><LI>Click the Buttons tab.

<P><LI>Select the entry for the application you want to change, and then
   click the Delete button.

<P><LI>Click the Add File button.

<P><LI>In the Add File dialog box, locate the application you want to add
   to the Old Office toolbar, and then click the Add button.

<P><LI>When you are finished in the Customize dialog box, click the OK
   button. If you deleted any buttons in step 3, you will be prompted to
   see if you really want to delete the item(s). If you click the Yes
   button, you may also be prompted to see if you really want to move the
   items to the recycle bin.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
