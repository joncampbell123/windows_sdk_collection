<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows, Professional Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
By default, when you install Microsoft Office 97 for Windows on your
computer, program shortcuts for the Microsoft Office 97 programs (Microsoft
Excel 97, Microsoft Word 97, and so on) are created in the Programs folder
of your Start menu.
<P>
This article explains how to configure the Microsoft Office 97 Setup
program so that program shortcuts are created in a subfolder of the
Programs folder ("Microsoft Office", for example).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: The following steps are not supported by Microsoft Product Support
Services (PSS). Under normal circumstances, only modifications made to
setup table files by the Network Installation Wizard (NIW) are supported by
Microsoft, but the NIW cannot make the necessary modifications in this
case. Use the following steps with caution.
<P>
NOTE: The following steps work only if you have first performed an
administrative installation ("setup /a") of Microsoft Office 97 to a server
on your network. If you are performing a standalone installation using the
Microsoft Office 97 compact disc, you cannot use the following steps.
<P>
You can control where the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program creates program
shortcuts by editing the setup table file (STF) used by the setup program.
By default, this file is called Off97pro.stf; however, if you have run the
Network Installation Wizard to customize your setup, the setup table file
may have a different name.
<P>
Before performing the following steps, make a backup copy of the
Off97pro.stf file stored on your server. Change the backup copy's name to
"Backup.stf" and do not open or edit it for any reason.

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, click Run. In the Open edit box, type "write"
   (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Open. In the File Name edit box, type the
   path to your server and share, followed by the name of the setup
   table file that you want to edit, for example
<P>
<P><PRE>       \\myserver\myshare\off97pro.stf
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       -or-
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>       \\myserver\myshare\custom.stf
</PRE><P>
   and then, click Open.

<P><LI>On the Edit menu, click Replace.

<P><LI>In the Find What edit box, type a value from the first column of
   the following table. Type a value from the second column of the
   table into the Replace With edit box. Then, click Replace All.
<P>
<PRE>      Find what   Replace with
      -----------------------------------
      %571        %571\Microsoft Office
      %1117       %1117\Microsoft Office
      %7229       %7229\Microsoft Office
      %8221       %8221\Microsoft Office
      %9672       %9672\Microsoft Office
      %10840      %10840\Microsoft Office
      %11964      %11964\Microsoft Office

   Add the following line if you have performed a Run from Server 
   installation (this will install the icon for Microsoft Access:
      %583        %583\Microsoft Office

</PRE><P><LI>Repeat step 4 until all values in the table have been replaced.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save. Click Text Document. Then, once the
   file has been saved, click Exit on the File menu.
<P>
</OL>Once you have completed these steps, when you run the Microsoft Office 97
Setup program, the program shortcuts will be created in the folder
"Microsoft Office" within the Programs folder on your Start menu. To force
the program shortcuts into a different folder, specify the appropriate
folder name in the Replace With edit box.
