The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup program for Microsoft Office 97, you may receive the
following error message near the end of the installation process, after all
files have been copied to your hard disk:
<P>
<PRE>   convdsn.exe - Unable to Locate DLL
   The dynamic link library MSVCIRT.dll could not be found in the
   specified path

</PRE>This error message is followed by a path statement that includes a list of
folders, including your Windows\System folder.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You have previously installed Microsoft Visual C++, version 4.2, on
   your computer.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You then removed Microsoft Visual C++, version 4.2, from your
   computer.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>As a result of this, the file Msvcirt.dll is no longer located in
   either the Windows\System folder on your hard disk or in any other
   folder in your path.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, either:

<UL><LI>Copy the Msvcirt.dll file from the Msdev\Redist folder of your
   Microsoft Visual C++, version 4.2, CD-ROM, into your Windows\System
   folder.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Copy the Msvcrt40.dll file from the root folder of your Microsoft
   Office 97 CD-ROM into your Windows\System folder.
<P>
</UL>After one of the files has been copied into your Windows\System folder, the
Microsoft Office 97 Setup program should work correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
After the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program has copied all necessary files
onto your computer's hard disk, it attempts to run the program Convdsn.exe.
This program, located in the Windows\System folder, converts ODBC data
source names (DSNs) so that they may be used by the programs included with
Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
When you install Microsoft Visual C++, version 4.2, on your computer, the
following two files are installed in your Windows\System folder:
<P>
<PRE>   Msvcrt40.dll
   Msvcirt.dll

</PRE>When the Setup program attempts to run Convdsn.exe, Convdsn.exe makes a
call to Msvcrt40.dll, which in turn calls Msvcirt.dll. If Msvcirt.dll has
been deleted or cannot be found, you may receive the error message shown
above.
<P>
You can correct the problem in one of two ways:

<UL><LI>Copy the Msvcirt.dll file from the Microsoft Visual C++, version 4.2,
   CD-ROM into your Windows\System folder. Doing this will allow the call
   from Convdsn.exe to Msvcrt40.dll to Msvcirt.dll to work correctly, and
   the problem will not occur.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Copy the Msvcrt40.dll file from the Microsoft Office 97 CD-ROM,
   into your Windows\System folder. This version of Msvcrt40.dll does not
   need to call Msvcirt.dll, so the problem will not occur.
