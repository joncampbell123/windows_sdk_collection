The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Help in a dialog box in one of your Microsoft applications,
you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find the QOFFICE.HLP file. Do you want to try to find this file
   yourself?

</PRE>If you click No, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot find the QOFFICE.HLP file. Check to see that the file exists on
   your disk. If it doesn't, you need to reinstall it.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you run the Setup program for one of the
applications listed above in maintenance mode and you click Remove All.
<P>
For example, if you install Microsoft PowerPoint, and then install
Microsoft Excel, if you run the Microsoft PowerPoint Setup program in
maintenance mode, and you click Remove All, you can no longer use Help in a
dialog box in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
This problem occurs because when you run the Setup program for these
Microsoft programs in maintenance mode and you remove the entire
application, the Setup program removes the Qoffice.hlp file, even though
this Help file is an Office shared application, and is used in other
programs.
<P>
The Qoffice.hlp file is used to display Help in the following dialog boxes
in the Microsoft applications listed above:
<P>
<PRE>   Open
   Save As
   Properties
   About

</PRE>To use Help in one of these dialog boxes, you can press F1, or you can
click the Help button (the question mark button that appears in the right
hand corner of the dialog box) and then click the item that you want help
on.
<P>
The Qoffice.hlp file is not the Office Help file that is available on the
Office Shortcut Bar.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To reinstall the Qoffice.hlp file, run the Setup program for your
application, and click the Reinstall button.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For additional information about shared Office files that are removed by
another applications Setup program, please see the following article(s) in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
