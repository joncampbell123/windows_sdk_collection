<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you send a fax that contains an attached Microsoft Word document from
any Microsoft Office 97 program, you may receive the following Visual Basic
for Applications error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Ambiguous Name Detected: tmpdde

</PRE>You may also receive this error message when you send any fax from
Microsoft Word.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when your fax software attempts to create a new Word
macro or routine with the same name as an existing macro or routine. In
this case, the Word global template may contain a macro named Tmpdde that
was created during a previously aborted fax attempt.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
You may be able to resolve this problem by deleting the Tmpdde macro from
the Microsoft Word global template (Normal.dot) file. If deleting this
macro does not resolve the problem, rename the Microsoft Word global
template (Normal.dot) file. Quit all MAPI-aware programs, such as mail,
fax, or Office programs. Then, restart the programs and resend the fax.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs most often when you send faxes from Microsoft Outlook
97 or Microsoft Word 97. In each reported case, the fax either contains an
attached Word document or is a Word document that is sent from within Word.
