<UL><LI>Microsoft Office Binder 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you print or print preview two or more worksheets in a Microsoft
Excel section in Microsoft Office Binder 97, some of the worksheets' page
numbers may appear incorrectly in the headers and/or footers.
For example, if you print or print preview an entire Microsoft Excel
section that contains five worksheets, the page numbers may appear as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>   1, 2, 3, 1, 2

   -or-

   1, 1, 1, 1, 1

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem will occur if you click Binder Print Preview on the File menu
when any worksheet other than the first worksheet in the section is active.
<P>
If you do this, Microsoft Office Binder 97 changes the active worksheet in
such a way that it will ALWAYS act as though it is page 1. This does not
cause a problem if you print or print preview just that worksheet, but it
will cause problems if you print or print preview the worksheet along with
a group of other worksheets.
<P>
For example, if your section contains the following worksheets, in order:
<P>
<PRE>   Sheet1, Sheet2, Sheet3

</PRE>Clicking Binder Print Preview when Sheet2 or Sheet3 is the active
worksheet will cause that worksheet to always display its page number as
page 1.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, do not click Binder Print
Preview on the File menu unless the first worksheet in the section is
the active worksheet.
<P>
If this problem has already occurred, the affected worksheets may not
display page numbers correctly when they are printed or print
previewed with a group of other worksheets. To correct this
problem, you must create a new worksheet, transfer the contents of the
affected worksheet to the new worksheet, and then delete the original
affected worksheet. To do this follow these steps:
<P>
<PRE>   1. On the Insert menu, click Worksheet.

   2. In the original affected worksheet, select the entire worksheet's
      contents by clicking Select All, above and to the left
      of the upper-leftmost cell, or by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + SPACEBAR.

   3. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

   4. Activate the newly-inserted worksheet.

   5. On the Edit menu, click Paste.

   Once the worksheet's contents have been copied to the new worksheet,
   you may also need to recreate (in the new worksheet) any defined
   names, charts, drawing objects, and Page Setup settings that existed
   in the original worksheet. Once this has been done, delete the
   original worksheet by activating it and then clicking Delete Sheet on
   the Edit menu.

   Note that you will need to repeat the above process for each affected
   worksheet in the Microsoft Excel section.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Office Binder 97, you can apply a common header and footer to
all of the worksheets in a Microsoft Excel section by activating the
section and clicking Binder Page Setup on the File menu.
<P>
If the header or footer you apply includes the code "&amp;[Page]", the page
number of each worksheet will appear when you print or print preview the
worksheet(s). The page numbers will appear in order (1, 2, 3, etc.) when
you print two or more of the worksheets, unless the problem described
above occurs.
<P>
You can print preview worksheets in a Microsoft Excel section by
activating the worksheet(s) you want to preview and then clicking Binder
Print Preview on the File menu.
