The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In a Microsoft Office 97 program, when you browse through the Office
Assistant Gallery, some assistants may appear twice.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You have rerun the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program in maintenance
   mode and selected the Reinstall option.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You have previously activated any Office Assistant character other
   than Clippit, the paper clip.
<P>
</UL>This problem may also occur if you install a standalone Microsoft
Office 97 program (such as Microsoft Word 97) and then install
Microsoft Office 97 itself.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To eliminate duplicate assistants from the Office Assistant Gallery,
follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In a Microsoft Office 97 program, right-click the Office Assistant
   window, and click Assistant on the shortcut menu.

<P><LI>Click the Gallery tab.

<P><LI>Use the Back and Next buttons to move to the first (leftmost)
   instance of the assistant whose duplicate you want to eliminate.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>The duplicate assistant should no longer appear in the Office Assistant
Gallery.
<P>
If the assistant that appears twice is the active assistant, switch to
another one, and then follow the steps above.
<P>
If the above steps do not work, follow these steps to manually delete
the duplicate assistant:

<OL><P><LI>Exit all of the Microsoft Office 97 programs.

<P><LI>Using the Windows Explorer, go to the following folder on your hard
   disk:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Actors
</PRE>
<P><LI>Each assistant's name should appear only once: either with an .acp
   extension, or with an .act extension. If an assistant's name appears
   twice (for example: Powerpup.act and Powerpup.acp), right-click the
   .acp file for that assistant, and click Delete on the shortcut menu.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you first install Microsoft Office 97 on a computer, the following
Microsoft Office Assistant files are installed into the
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Actors folder on your hard disk:
<P>
<PRE>   File Name      File Type
   --------------------------------------------
   Clippit.act    Office Assistant Actor file
   Dot.acp        Office Assistant Preview file
   Genius.acp     Office Assistant Preview file
   Hoverbot.acp   Office Assistant Preview file
   Logo.acp       Office Assistant Preview file
   Mnature.acp    Office Assistant Preview file
   Powerpup.acp   Office Assistant Preview file
   Scribble.acp   Office Assistant Preview file
   Will.acp       Office Assistant Preview file

</PRE></OL>The Clippit assistant is the default Office Assistant when you install
Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
When you use the Microsoft Office Assistant Gallery to switch to a
different Office Assistant, such as PowerPup, the .act file for that
assistant (Powerpup.act) is installed and the .acp preview file for the
assistant (Powerpup.acp) is removed.
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program in maintenance mode and
select the Reinstall option, Setup reinstalls files that are no longer
present. Using the above example, the Setup program reinstalls the
Powerpup.acp file, since it is no longer present and you now have both
Powerpup.acp and Powerpup.act installed on your hard disk.
<P>
If the .acp and .act files for an assistant are both installed at the same
time, the character is displayed twice in the Office Assistant Gallery. To
eliminate this problem, use the workaround to remove the .acp file for the
specific assistant.
