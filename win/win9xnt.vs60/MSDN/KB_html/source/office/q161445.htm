The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a

</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you drag a Microsoft Excel workbook into a briefcase, you may
receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Update Briefcase
   '&lt;filename&gt;' will not be updated because its merge handler cannot be
   loaded.

</PRE>When you drag a Microsoft Office 97 Binder file into a briefcase, you may
receive either of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Update Briefcase
   '&lt;filename&gt;' will not be updated because its merge handler cannot be
   loaded.

   -or-

   Microsoft Office Binder Reconciler
   The binder could not be saved.
   The disk is write-protected.

</PRE>When you drag a Microsoft Access 97 database into a briefcase, you may
receive either of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Briefcase
   Briefcase can't open the database '&lt;filename&gt;'.
   The Microsoft Jet database engine cannot open the file '&lt;filename&gt;'.
   It is already opened exclusively by another user, or you need
   permission to view its data.

   -or-

   Briefcase
   Briefcase can't open the database '&lt;filename&gt;'.
   Couldn't lock file.

</PRE>NOTE: In these error messages, &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the file you
are attempting to drag into a briefcase.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems may occur when any of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The file you are dragging is stored on a network share to which you
   have only read-only access.

<LI>The read-only attribute for the file you are dragging is enabled.

<LI>The Office 97 Binder or Microsoft Access 97 database files you are
   dragging is stored on a disk that is write-protected (the tab is open).

<LI>You are dragging a Microsoft Excel 5.0/95 workbook into a briefcase
   on a machine where Microsoft Excel 97 is installed.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent these problems from occurring, use the following appropriate
method before you drag the file into a briefcase:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Copy the File to Another Location</h3>
 
<P>
If the file is stored on a read-only network share or a write-
protected disk, copy the file to a location to which you have
write access (for example, your local hard drive, or a network share
to which you have full or write permissions). Then, drag the file from the
new location into the briefcase.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 2: Obtain Permission to Write to the Network Share</h3>
 
<P>
If the file is stored on a read-only network share, check with your
network administrator to see whether you can obtain permission to write to
the share. After you obtain permission, drag the file into the briefcase.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 3: Close the Tab on the Disk</h3>
 
<P>
If the file is stored on a write-protected disk, close the tab on the disk.
Then, drag the file from the disk into the briefcase.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 4: Clear the Read-Only Attribute for the File</h3>
 
<P>
If the read-only attribute for the file is selected, clear it. To do
this in Microsoft Windows 95 and Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, use the
following steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Windows Explorer, select the file by clicking it once.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Properties.

<P><LI>Clear (uncheck) the Read-only check box. Then, click OK.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If the file is stored on a read-only network share or a write-
protected disk, you must first copy the file to another location.
<P>
After you turn off the read-only attribute for the file, drag the file
into the briefcase.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 5: Save the Workbook in the Microsoft Excel 97 Format</h3>
 
<P>
If the workbook is saved in the Microsoft Excel 5.0/95 format, open the
workbook in Microsoft Excel 97 and save it in the Microsoft Excel 97
format by clicking Save As on the File menu, selecting "Microsoft Excel
Workbook" in the Save As Type list, and clicking Save.
<P>
Once the workbook is saved in the Microsoft Excel 97 format, you should
be able to drag it into the briefcase.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of the programs listed at the beginning of this
article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Office 97 includes a feature that allows you to reconcile files
in a briefcase. This feature allows the briefcase to make changes to both
the original copy of a file and the updated copy of a file at the same
time.
<P>
To use this feature, you must have write permission to the file when you
drag it into a briefcase. If you have permission, you receive one of the
error messages in this article, and the file in the briefcase is not
updated correctly.
