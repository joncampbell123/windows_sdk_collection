The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you view a policy file (either Config.pol or Ntconfig.pol) using the
Policy Editor that is included with the "Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit,"
the settings that appear may not be the same settings that appear when you
first create the file.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs because the Policy Editor incorrectly displays the
settings in the .pol file.
<P>
NOTE: Although the Policy Editor displays the incorrect settings, the .pol
file does have the correct settings.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you want to make additional changes to an existing policy file, do not
open the file in the Policy Editor because you cannot determine precisely
which settings you changed and which settings the Policy Editor incorrectly
changed. Instead, create a new policy file with all of the necessary
settings (your original ones and the new ones).
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Using the System Policy Editor, you can set user policies for all users,
for a particular network group, or for a single user. User Policies are
system policies that represent program options relevant to the user who is
currently logged on to Windows. User Policies are stored in the HKEY_USERS
key in the Windows registry.
<P>
You can also set computer policies for all client computers or for a single
computer. Computer policies are system policies that represent options
relevant to the user's computer. They are stored in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
key in the Windows registry.
