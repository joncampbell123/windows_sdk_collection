The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, version 4.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you insert a Microsoft Graph object, and you choose Microsoft Graph
Help from the Help menu, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Help--This file is not a Microsoft Help file

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs if Microsoft Graph version 3.0 is installed on your
computer, and you then install Microsoft Graph version 5.0, using the
Microsoft Office version 4.2 Setup program.
<P>
This behavior occurs in this case, because the Microsoft Graph version 5.0
Help file and the Microsoft Graph version 3.0 Help file have the same name.
When you run Microsoft Office Setup, and you install Microsoft Graph, the
Microsoft Graph 5.0 Help file is not copied over an existing Microsoft
Graph version 3.0 Help file.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Drag the Microsoft Graph Help file to the trash. This file is located in
   the Microsoft folder.

<P><LI>Run the Microsoft Office Setup program again in maintenance mode. Choose
   the Add/Remove button.

<P><LI>In the Installed Components list, click the arrow next to the Shared
   Applications. Clear the check box next to every item that you do not
   want to remove. Make sure that the check box next to Graph is selected.
   Choose Continue.

<P><LI>When Setup is complete, run Setup again in maintenance mode. Choose the
   Add/Remove button.

<P><LI>In the Components Not Yet Installed list, click the arrow next to Shared
   Applications. Select the check box next to Graph. Clear the check box
   next to any items that you do NOT want to install. Make sure the check
   box next to Graph is selected. If Graph is the only item under Shared
   Applications, select the check box next to Shared Applications. Choose
   Continue.
<P>
</OL>Setup will copy the Microsoft Graph version 5.0 Help file to the Microsoft
folder correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
