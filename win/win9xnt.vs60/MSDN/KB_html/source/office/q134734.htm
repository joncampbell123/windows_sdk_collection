The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Help in a program, and you build an index using the Find tab,
not all of the Help files for that program may be available. Additionally,
the Help file for your program may not contain all of the books (Contents
tab) or topics that should be available for your program.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a Help file, you can use the Find Setup Wizard (the first time
you click the Find tab) to create a list that contains every word from the
Help files for your programs. When the word list is created, you can
click the Options button on the Find tab, to select the Find options, such
as which files to search. The list of files to search may not contain all
of the Help files that you know are on your computer.
<P>
This problem occurs, for example, if you did not install all of the Help
files for a program. However, this problem also occurs if you install
an individual Help file after installing the main Help file. For example,
if you install the Online Help For Visual Basic component for Microsoft
Excel after installing the Online Help For Microsoft Excel component, the
Visual Basic Help topics are not available in the Microsoft Excel Help
file. Additionally, the Visual Basic For Programs Reference is not
available in the list of files to search in the File Options dialog box
when you change the Index options for Microsoft Excel Help.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To update the Help contents after installing an individual Help file, use
one of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Excel</h3>
 
<P>
To add the Visual Basic Reference to the Microsoft Excel Help contents,
activate an existing module or insert a new Visual Basic module, and press
F1 while the module sheet is active. Visual Basic Help appears because of
the context sensitive Help capability, and the Help file is added to the
Contents tab. If this does not work try entering a VBA topic such as "Add"
to a module sheet, then hit F1 for that topic to add Help for VBA.
<P>
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Word</h3>
 
<P>
Create or edit a new macro, and press F1 while the macro window is active.
WordBasic Help appears because of the context sensitive Help capability,
and the Help file is added to the Contents tab.
<P>
NOTE: Removing the entire program such as Microsoft Excel or Word, and
then installing the program again, including all of the Help files,
will also resolve this issue. However, this option should only be used when
all other methods fail to resolve this issue.
<P>
Note that if you install the Microsoft Excel Help file, and you later
install the DAO Help file without installing the Visual Basic Reference
Help file, the Microsoft Excel Help file will not contain the book
(Contents tab) or topics for the DAO Help file.
<P>
For additional information about installing the DAO Help file after
installing the Microsoft Excel Help file, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in
Microsoft Office versions 7.0a and 7.0b for Windows 95.
