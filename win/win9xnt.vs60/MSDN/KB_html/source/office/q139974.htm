The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Small Business Pack for Windows 95, version 1.0
<LI>Microsoft Office Professional for Windows 95, version 7.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to open Small Business Pack templates from Small Business
Pack Help, you may encounter any of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot Find or Run the file or program
   \mydocu~1\&lt;folder name&gt;\&lt;file name&gt;

   -or-

   Cannot Find or Run the file or program
   \mydocu~1\&lt;folder name&gt;\&lt;file name&gt;

   -or-

   Cannot Find or Run the file or program
   \mydocu~1\&lt;folder name&gt;\&lt;file name&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;folder name&gt; and &lt;file name&gt; are the folder and file name for the
particular template you are trying to open.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if you installed Small Business Pack on a computer
with multiple or partitioned hard drives and either Microsoft Office or
Small Business Pack, or both, are installed to the drive that does not
contain Microsoft Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, make sure that Microsoft Office and Small Business
Pack are installed on the same drive as Microsoft Windows. For example, if
you have Microsoft Windows installed on your C drive, both Microsoft Office
and Small Business Pack should be installed on the C drive as well.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: The D drive mentioned in these workarounds refers to either a
separate partition on your hard drive or a separate drive altogether, and
the C drive is the drive on which Microsoft Windows is installed.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Office on the C Drive and Small Business Pack on the D Drive</h3>
 
<P>
To access the templates when your computer is configured this way, use
either of the following methods.
<P>
Method 1: Open the templates by clicking the Small Business Pack shortcuts
<PRE>          on the Small Business Pack toolbar on the Office Shortcut Bar.

</PRE>Method 2: Use the following steps to start one of the Microsoft Access
<PRE>          databases from Small Business Pack Help:

          a. Click the Small Business Pack Help button on the Small
             Business Pack toolbar on the Office Shortcut Bar.

          b. Click the Answer Wizard tab and type "Job Listings" (without
             the quotation marks).

          c. Click Search, and then click "Job Listings" from the help
             topics list.

          d. Click "To Open the Job Listings form now, click"

          e. Once the database is started and you are prompted to attach a
             database, click Close.

          f. Close Help.

</PRE><h3>Microsoft Office on the D Drive and Small Business Pack on the C Drive</h3>
 
<P>
To access the templates when your computer is configured this way, use
either of the following methods.
<P>
Method 1: (Preferred method) Remove Microsoft Office from your D drive and
<PRE>          remove Office Small Business Pack from your C drive and then
          install them both to the C drive.

</PRE>Method 2: Access the templates by clicking the Small Business Pack
<PRE>          shortcuts on the Small Business Pack Office Shortcut Bar.

</PRE><h3>Both Microsoft Office and Small Business Pack on the D Drive</h3>
 
<P>
Although you may not receive an error message immediately, once you do, the
Help links to the Word, Microsoft Excel, and PowerPoint templates cease to
work. The Microsoft Access links will work, but you will need to reinstall
the Small Business Pack to get the links to work again for the other
templates.
<P>
If you receive the error message, use either of the following methods.
<P>
Method 1: Open the templates through the Small Business Pack shortcuts on
<PRE>          the Office Shortcut Bar.

</PRE>Method 2: Start the Small Business Pack Setup and choose the "Remove All"
<PRE>          option to remove the Small Business Pack. Then, restart Setup and
          reinstall Small Business Pack. Note that reinstalling may not
          permanently remove the problem and the error message may appear
          again later if you chose to install Small Business Pack to the D
          drive again.

</PRE>For additional information, please see the following article(s) in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

               Business Pack
