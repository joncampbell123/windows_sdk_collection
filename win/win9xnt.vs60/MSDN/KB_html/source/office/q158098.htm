The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program, you may receive the
following alert message:
<P>
<PRE>   The Microsoft Office Upgrade Wizard has detected one or more Office
   4.x or 95 components on your computer. Removing these components is
   recommended and will not affect your existing data.

   Remove ALL old Office 4.x and 95 components now?

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Removing Earlier Versions of Office</h3>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office 97, the Setup program checks to see
whether any components from Office 4.2, 4.3, or Office 95 (Standard and
Professional editions) are installed on your computer. If Setup detects
these components, it displays the dialog box. If you click Yes, Setup
removes components that were installed with earlier versions of Office.
This helps prevent unnecessary files from using up disk space on your
computer.
<P>
Note that if you remove the older components, other programs that use the
components may not work correctly. For example, assume that you want to
install Microsoft Office 97, and that you previously developed custom
programs that work in Microsoft Access 7.0. To use the custom program,
Microsoft Access 7.0 must be available after you install Microsoft Office
97. Therefore, you perform a Custom installation of Microsoft Office 97,
and install only Microsoft Excel 97, Microsoft Word 97, and Microsoft
PowerPoint 97. However, if you click Yes in the dialog box, Setup removes
Microsoft Access 7.0 and all of its components.
<P>
<P><h3>When to Remove Older Components</h3>
 
<P>
To help you decide when to remove older components, use the information
in the following cases.
<P>
Case 1: You haven't installed Office 97 and want to use the earlier
<PRE>        versions of Office programs.

        Use either of the following methods to set up Office 97.

         - Run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program. When you are prompted
           to remove the earlier components, click No.

           When Setup is completed, the older Office programs will be
           available.

         - Run the Microsoft Office Upgrade Wizard, which is located in the
           ValuPack\OffClean folder on the Microsoft Office 97 compact
           disc, and choose which earlier components to remove or keep. To
           start the wizard, double-click the Offcln97.exe file and follow
           the instructions.

           When the Microsoft Office Upgrade Wizard is finished removing
           files, run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program and click No
           when you are prompted to remove the older components.

</PRE>Case 2: You haven't installed Office 97 and want to remove the earlier
<PRE>        version of Office programs.

        Run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program. When you are prompted
        to remove the earlier components, click Yes.

</PRE>Case 3: You installed Office 97, clicked Yes in the dialog box, and cannot
<PRE>        use earlier versions of Office programs.

        If you removed the earlier versions, you must reinstall the
        programs. To do this, use the following steps:

        a. Run the Setup program for each of the older programs and
           reinstall them.

        b. Verify that the older programs work correctly.

        c. Run the Microsoft Office Upgrade Wizard and remove any
           unnecessary old components. (This step is optional.)

        d. Run the Setup program for Microsoft Office 97 again and click No
           when you are prompted to remove older components.

        After you complete these steps, older programs and Microsoft Office
        97 programs will be available.

</PRE>Case 4: You installed Office 97, clicked No in the dialog box, and want to
<PRE>        remove the earlier versions.

        Use the Microsoft Office Upgrade Wizard to remove older components.
