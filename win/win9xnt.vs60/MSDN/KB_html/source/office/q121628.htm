<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you perform an administrative installation of any version of
Microsoft Office, you are prompted to choose one of three locations
from which to run the shared applications: Server, Local Hard Drive,
or User's Choice.
<P>
If the SETUP /A is run from a workstation that runs a non-shared, local
copy of Microsoft Windows to a network environment that runs from a
shared copy of Microsoft Windows, the shared applications will run from
the user's local installation of Microsoft Windows, regardless of which
option is chosen during Setup (that is, Server, Local Hard Drive, or
User's Choice). This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Because Microsoft Office is unable to detect that it is to be run from
a shared Windows environment, and is further unable to detect where
that shared environment is, it makes an assumption that future changes
to the shared installation of Microsoft Windows will also point to this
location. Installing Microsoft Office from a computer that runs from
the shared installation of Microsoft Windows to the network will not
affect the way local installations of Microsoft Windows work. The local
users will be able to run the Shared Applications from the network
server, their local hard drive, or the user's choice, depending on how
the administrator configured the administrative installation.
