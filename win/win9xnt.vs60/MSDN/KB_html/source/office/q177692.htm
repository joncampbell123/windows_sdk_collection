The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition
<LI>Microsoft Excel 98 Macintosh Edition
<LI>Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 98 Macintosh Edition
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the Finder, if you double-click a file in the Microsoft Office 98:Office
folder, you may receive an alert message that is similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Library

   This file adds functionality to your computer. To add this file's
   functionality to your computer, place the file in the Extensions
   folder or drop it on your closed System Folder icon.

</PRE>If you follow these instructions, and then attempt to start or use one of
the programs included in Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition, you may
receive one or more of the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;Program&gt; cannot load the Microsoft Office 98 shared libraries. There
   may not be enough free memory to load the libraries or files may have
   been moved from their originally installed locations.

   -or-

   The Visual Basic Editor could not be loaded. There may not be enough
   free memory to load the libraries or files may have been deleted or
   moved from their originally installed locations.

   -or-

   An error occurred initializing the VBA libraries (8)

   -or-

   A lexicon (Excel 409 Lexicon) is missing or damaged.

</PRE>You may also receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Sorry, a system error occurred.
   "Finder"
      error type 10

</PRE>If you receive the system error message, you must restart the computer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems occur if you use the Finder to move any files that the
Finder displays with a Kind setting of "library" out of the Microsoft
Office 98:Office folder. These files include the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Address Book Library
   Excel Macro Scanner
   Microsoft C Runtime Library
   Microsoft Conversion Library
   Microsoft Office 98
   OE Address Book Lib
   VBA Converter (1.0)
   VBA Localization Library (1)
   Visual Basic for Applications

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, do not move library files included with Microsoft
Office 98 Macintosh Edition into the System Folder, the System
Folder:Extensions folder, or any other folder. For the Microsoft Office 98
Macintosh Edition programs to work correctly, the library files must remain
in the Microsoft Office 98:Office folder.
<P>
If you have moved any of these files, move them back into the Microsoft
Office 98:Office folder.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of the Macintosh operating system and the
library files that are included with Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To view the Kind type for a specific file, do either of the following:

<UL><LI>Select the file. On the File menu, click Get Info. The Kind type is
   displayed near the top of the Info dialog box.

<LI>In Mac OS 8.0 (System 8.0), click As List on the View menu. One of the
   columns that appears in the window is labeled Kind.
<P>
   If you click the column header, files are sorted by Kind; this allows
   you to easily view all files of a particular Kind type.
