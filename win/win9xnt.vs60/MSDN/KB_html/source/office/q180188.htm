<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you close a Microsoft Word document or a Microsoft Excel workbook, you
may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, an error message similar to the following appears:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;PROGRAM&gt; caused an invalid page fault in module OLE32.DLL at &lt;address&gt;

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur if the Office item log file, Offitems.log, is
damaged.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To troubleshoot this error, attempt to isolate the problem to corruption in
the Offitems.log log file, which is located in your Windows folder.
<P>
To check for corruption in the log file, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Close all programs.

<P><LI>Rename the Offitems.log file (to Offitems.old for example).

<P><LI>Restart Word or Excel, open a file, make a change to the file, save the
   file, and then close the file.

<P><LI>If the error does not appear, the problem has been isolated.

<P><LI>If the error reappears, close Word or Excel.

<P><LI>Find the file called OLE2.REG and double-click the file name.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The log file, Offitems.log, stores journal information into Microsoft
Outlook on the create, open, close and save events for any file in Office
97. If renaming the log file allows Outlook to start successfully, Outlook
regenerates the log files. However, any journal information contained in
the original log file will be lost.
<P>
The Outlook Journal process automatically records a log of user activities.
Each of the Office 97 programs provides AutoJournal capabilities, logging
to an Outlook Journal entry each time you open, save, or print a document.
With the Journal and the Outlook 97 timeline view, you can find information
based on when you worked on a document, and not worry about where you saved
it or what you named it. To configure Outlook 97 to use the AutoJournal
feature, use the Journal tab on the Options dialog box. With this you can
add, remove, and edit the types of AutoJournal entries.
<P>
If you turn on Outlook AutoJournal for any of the Office 97 programs,
Outlook tries to record activities of the Office program directly to the
Outlook Journal. When Outlook is not running, the Office program makes a
call to Mso97.dll that causes the journal entry to write to "Offitems.log"
in the Windows directory. When Outlook starts, the Journal processes these
entries after a Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) idle
time of 30 seconds.
<P>
