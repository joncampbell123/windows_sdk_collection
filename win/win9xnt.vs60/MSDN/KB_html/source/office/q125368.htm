The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for the Power Macintosh, version 4.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Connectix RAM Doubler version 1.5.1 is shipped with the Microsoft
Office version 4.2 for the Power Macintosh upgrade.
<P>
Note that Connectix RAM Doubler version 1.04 is shipped with
Microsoft Office version 4.2 for the Macintosh. Connectix Ram Doubler
runs on both Macintosh and Power Macintosh computers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For a limited time, Connectix Ram Doubler is included with Microsoft
Office. Connectix RAM Doubler provides up to twice the available
memory on your system by using memory optimization and compression.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing Connectix RAM Doubler</h3>
 
<P>
It is recommended that you run Office Setup before you install
Connectix Ram Doubler. To install Connectix Ram Doubler, do the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Insert the Office Install Disk 1 in your floppy disk drive.

      NOTE: Read the Ram Doubler Readme file also included in the Connectix
      Ram Doubler folder before you install Connectix Ram Doubler to note
      any possible incompatibilities with your system.

   2. Open the Connectix Ram Doubler folder.

   3. Double-click the RAM Doubler Installer file.

</PRE><h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
 
<P>
If you have problems when you restart your Macintosh after installing
Connectix Ram Doubler, do the following:

<UL><LI>Keep Ram Doubler from loading by holding down the ~ (tilde) key or the
   ESC key while restarting your Macintosh.

<LI>If this doesn't work, you can hold down the SHIFT key when you start
   your Macintosh to prevent all of your Inits and Control Panels from
   loading.
<P>
</UL><h3>Incompatibility with Virtual Memory Manager</h3>
 
<P>
Connectix Ram Doubler is not compatible with the Virtual Memory Manager
provided with your Macintosh, because both utilities require access to
certain hardware. In order to run the Connectix Ram Doubler utility, you
need to turn off virtual memory from the Memory control panel. If you have
performance problems after installing Connectix Ram Doubler, you may want
to remove the utility and return to using virtual memory. For additional
information, see the Connectix RAM Doubler manual.
