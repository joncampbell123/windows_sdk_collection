<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following information was published as part four of a five-part
series in the 12/12/94 issue of MacWeek.
<P>
<P><h2>TIPS AND TRICKS FOR MICROSOFT OFFICE VERSION 4.2</h2>
 
<P>
Dear Mac User:
<P>
This is part 4 (of a five part series) of tips and tricks on the new
Microsoft Office Standard version 4.2 (which includes Microsoft Excel
5.0, Word 6.0, PowerPoint 4.0 and a Microsoft Mail 3.1 workstation
license). We hope you find this information useful as you upgrade
your organization to Office 4.2.
<P>
<PRE>                                                    -The Microsoft Mac Team

</PRE><h2>PART 4:  WHAT'S NEW IN THE OFFICE APPLICATIONS?</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>What's New in the Office 4.2 Applications?</h3>
 
<P>
Microsoft Office Standard version 4.2 contains hundreds of new
features that address your needs. The four major design goals were to
make Office:

<UL><LI>Easier to use by including features such as ToolTips to identify toolbar
   buttons, context-sensitive shortcut menus, and Tip Wizard to make
   capabilities more easily discoverable.

<LI>Consistent and better integrated to leverage your learning across
   programs and platforms. Menu structures, toolbars, shortcut menus and
   command keys are much more similar. Drag a chart from Microsoft Excel
   right into your Word document.

<LI>A platform for your custom solutions with Visual Basic for Applications
   in Microsoft Excel, WordBasic, and support for AppleScript(TM) in both
   Microsoft Excel and Word.

<LI>Optimized for Macintosh by adding support for AppleScript,
   PowerTalk, QuickDraw GX Printing and of course, the Power Macintosh
   native. Plus we've improved QuickTime support.
<P>
</UL><h3>Tips On New Features To Help You!</h3>
 
<P>
It's easy to just add more "bells and whistles," but Microsoft makes
a science of listening to you. In fact, more than 70% of wishes
made for the three main Office programs have been answered in Office
4.2. Here are some examples:
<P>
Microsoft Excel 5.0:

<UL><LI>In-cell editing and rich cell text formatting.

<LI>Automatic subtotals: Insert in a sorted list with a couple of mouse
   clicks.

<LI>Auditing tools: Microsoft Excel visually traces formulas showing
   dependencies.

<LI>Hands-on charting: Directly select, resize and format any part of a
   chart to get the look you want.

<LI>PivotTable dynamic views: Analyze numbers from multiple perspectives,
   such as sales data by region, product line, or salesperson.
<P>
</UL>Word 6.0:

<UL><LI>Revision marking: Track revisions made by multiple editors, and accept
   or reject each one.

<LI>Macro language:  Build your own solutions using WordBasic, a powerful
   language with over 800 macro functions to programatically expose all of
   the features within Word.

<LI>Fully editable Print Preview: Display dozens of fully editable
   "thumbnails" at once.

<LI>Full file compatibility with Word for Windows: Edit and share documents,
   and share custom solutions with no translations necessary.

<LI>Easy table editing: Have Word automatically format tables!
<P>
</UL>PowerPoint 4.0:

<UL><LI>AutoContent Wizard: Get past the blank screen by using a built-in
   presentation outline, such as "Recommending a Strategy" or "Selling a
   Product, Service or Idea".

<LI>Pick A Look Wizard: Easily pick templates, and customize slides and
   support materials.

<LI>AutoLayouts: Just point and click to insert a new slide that looks just
   like the one you want.

<LI>Hidden Slides: Come prepared to answer the tough questions with back up
   information.

<LI>Drag and Drop:  Reuse existing content in new presentations by simply
   dragging and dropping.
<P>
</UL><h2>CUSTOMER'S TIP!</h2>
 
<P>
"Microsoft Word 6.0 is an effective upgrade: It's consistent with the
other applications in Office, and allows you to get up to speed very
quickly. One of my favorite features is AutoFormat - it's outstanding
for complex documents!"
<P>
"The PivotTable in Microsoft Excel 5.0 allows me to draw relations
from large quantities of raw data and break down massive amounts of
data in a remarkable amount of time. The graphic capabilities are
very impressive and enable me to make decisions much more rapidly and
efficiently."
