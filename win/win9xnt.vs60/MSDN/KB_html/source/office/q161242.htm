<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program, the Add/Remove,
Reinstall, and Remove All options do not appear even though you previously
successfully installed Microsoft Office 97 on the computer. Instead, the
Setup program proceeds as if you never installed Microsoft Office 97 on the
computer.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may occur when all of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You successfully install Microsoft Office 97 on the computer.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You subsequently run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program in
   maintenance mode and click either Add/Remove or Reinstall.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>While the Setup program is copying files to the hard disk, you
   click Cancel and exit the Setup program before it is finished.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent this problem from occurring, do not click Cancel when the Setup
program is copying files to the hard disk.
<P>
To resolve this problem, run the Setup program and allow the Setup program
to copy all the required files to the hard disk. After Setup is complete,
you can run the Setup program in maintenance mode.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office 97 Setup program, it runs in one of two
modes.
<P>
<PRE>   Mode          Setup behavior
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Initial       Setup runs in this mode when Microsoft Office 97 is not
                 currently installed on the computer. In this mode, the
                 Add/Remove, Reinstall, and Remove All options do not
                 appear. Instead, you are prompted to choose a type of
                 installation and (optionally) select the components to
                 install. Setup then copies the files to the hard disk.

   Maintenance   Setup runs in this mode when Microsoft Office 97 is
                 currently installed on the computer. In this mode, the
                 Add/Remove (add and remove selected components), Reinstall
                 (reinstall Office using the same settings), and Remove All
                 (remove Office from the computer) options appear. If you
                 click Add/Remove or Reinstall, Setup copies the files
                 to the hard disk.

</PRE>NOTE: When you run the Setup program in maintenance mode, if you click
Add/Remove or Reinstall, the Setup program copies files to the hard disk.
While Setup copies the files, a dialog box appears and displays the Setup
program's progress. If you click Cancel in this dialog box, the Setup
program stops and fails to copy the files.
<P>
In addition, the setup table (.stf) file that contains the Microsoft Office
97 setup information (usually, Off97pro.stf or Off97std.stf) is changed so
that if you run the Setup program again, it runs in initial mode. The only
way to correct this problem is to run the Setup program and allow it to
copy all required files to your hard disk.
