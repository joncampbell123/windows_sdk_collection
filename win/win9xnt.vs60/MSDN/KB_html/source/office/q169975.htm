The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Access 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Because of the design of the programs included in Microsoft Office 97,
accessibility aids may not work with the programs listed at the beginning
of this article. The "More Information" section of this article contains
information about specific accessibility aids and how to obtain updated
versions of these programs.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Accessibility aids are used by some people with disabilities. They include
the following types of programs:

<UL><LI>Screen readers for people who are severely visually impaired or blind
<LI>Screen magnifiers for people with low vision
<LI>On-screen keyboards and speech-recognition (dictation) software for
   people with limited dexterity
<LI>Keyboard enhancement utilities for people who have difficulty with
   standard keyboard behavior
<P>
</UL>The programs included with Microsoft Office 97 include a new system of
menus and toolbars, collectively known as command bars. Because command
bars are provided by each program, rather than by the operating system,
earlier versions of accessibility aids may not work with these new command
bars. However, command bars implement a new form of accessibility called
Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA). MSAA greatly enhances the
accessibility of command bars when used with accessibility aids that
support MSAA.
<P>
The following sections provide information about specific accessibility
aids for which Microsoft has been able to obtain information. Please note
that this list is not comprehensive; information about other accessibility
aids will be added as it becomes available.
