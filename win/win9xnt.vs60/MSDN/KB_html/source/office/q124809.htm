or uninstall) a single program or part of a program.
<P>

Windows, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

               Component

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Note that you should restart your Macintosh while holding down the SHIFT
key to disable extensions before running Setup with either of the following
methods.
<P>
<P><h3>To Reinstall Office</h3>
 
<P>
If one of the Microsoft Office files becomes damaged after you have
installed Office, follow these steps to reinstall Office:

<OL><P><LI>In the Finder, rename the damaged files.

<P><LI>Run Microsoft Office Setup again from the Microsoft Office Install Disk
   1 or from the network server directory from which you originally
   installed the program.
<P>
   The Setup program detects that Microsoft Office has already been
   installed, and starts the Microsoft Office Setup installation
   maintenance program.

<P><LI>When the Microsoft Office Setup dialog box appears, click Reinstall.
<P>
   This procedure repeats your last installation. Setup detects the files
   that exist and replaces only the missing files. (Setup does not detect
   renamed files and replaces them.)
<P>
   Once the reinstallation is complete, the Microsoft Office Setup program
   will restart your Macintosh.
<P>
</OL><h3>To Add a Single Program</h3>
 
<P>
To add a program, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Run Microsoft Office Setup again from the Microsoft Office Install
   Disk 1 or from the network server directory from which you originally
   installed the program.

<P><LI>When the Microsoft Office Setup dialog box appears, click the
   Add/Remove button.

<P><LI>In the Components Not Yet Installed list, select the check box for the
   program that you want to add, and then click the Continue button.
<P>
   NOTE: If you only want to add part of a program, click the triangle
   next to the program name to display a list of the program
   options. Select the items that you want to add.

<P><LI>Click the Continue button.
<P>
   The Microsoft Office Setup program will prompt you for the disks that
   it needs in order to add the files for the selected programs.
<P>
</OL>Once Setup is complete for the selected program, Setup will restart your
Macintosh.
<P>
<P><h3>To Remove a Single Program</h3>
 
<P>
To remove a program, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Run Microsoft Office Setup again from the Microsoft Office Install
   Disk 1, or from the network server directory from which you originally
   installed the program.
<P>
   The Setup program detects that Microsoft Office has already been
   installed, and starts the Microsoft Office Setup installation
   maintenance program.

<P><LI>When the Microsoft Office Setup dialog box appears, click Add/Remove.
<P>
   A dialog box appears with a Components Not Yet Installed list, and
   an Installed Components list.

<P><LI>In the Installed Components list, click to select the check box for the
   program that you want to remove, and then click Continue.
<P>
   NOTE: If you only want to remove part of a program, click the
   triangle next to the program name to display a list of the
   program options. Click to clear any items that you do NOT want to
   remove.
<P>
</OL>The Microsoft Office Setup program removes the files for the
programs that you selected, and then restarts your Macintosh.
