<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Case 1: Microsoft Excel Chart Sheet</h3>
 
<P>
When you scale a Microsoft Excel 5.0 chart object that is embedded in a
Microsoft Word document, the chart plot area may be scaled while the chart
text, chart legend, and the object frame remain unscaled. These symptoms
occur if your chart is a separate chart sheet in Microsoft Excel (instead
of an embedded chart object in the Microsoft Excel worksheet).
<P>
Note: This only affects charts that you embed in Word; it does not apply to
linked charts.
<P>
<P><h3>Case 2: Chart Embedded in a Microsoft Excel Worksheet</h3>
 
<P>
When you scale a chart object that is an embedded chart (instead of a
separate chart sheet), the chart in the object is displayed off center, the
Microsoft Excel worksheet cells are visible, and the chart object frame
returns to its original size.
<P>
These symptoms do not occur if you choose the Paste Link button in the
Paste Special dialog box to create a linked object rather than an embedded
object in Word. However, when you link the chart, it resizes in Word
whenever you resize the original chart in Microsoft Excel.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Case 1 occurs because the EMBED field in the Word document contains the \s
switch, which returns an embedded object to its original size when you
update the field. Word adds the \s switch when you use the Paste Special
command on the Edit menu to embed a Microsoft Excel chart object. By
contrast, Word does not add the \s switch when you embed the chart using
the Object command on the Insert menu.
<P>
Case 2 occurs partly because of the \s EMBED field switch, and partly
because, with an embedded chart, you embed Microsoft Excel worksheet cells
as well as the embedded chart. This means the embedded object behaves more
like a Microsoft Excel 5.0 Worksheet object than a Chart object. For best
results in Word, you should embed a chart sheet rather than an embedded
chart whenever possible.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Embed a chart that is located on a chart sheet instead of an embedded
chart, and then size the chart in Microsoft Excel (before you embed it in
Word). In Word, use the following procedure to embed the chart:

<OL><P><LI>From the Insert menu, choose Object, and select the Create From File
   tab.

<P><LI>Select the Microsoft Excel workbook that contains the chart sheet you
   want to embed, and then choose OK.

<P><LI>If the chart you want to embed is not the active sheet in the workbook,
   double-click the object and select the sheet tab of the appropriate
   chart in Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>When the chart that you want to embed is displayed, scale the chart
   object as desired, and then click anywhere outside the chart to return
   to Word.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Use this method when you must use an embedded chart instead of a chart
sheet. For best results, use Method 1 whenever possible.
<P>
To scale an embedded Microsoft Excel Chart object in Microsoft Word for
Windows without distorting the chart object or displaying cells from a
worksheet, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Insert the chart object in the Word document, and then select the chart
   object.

<P><LI>Press SHIFT+F9 to display the field code instead of the object.
<P>
   The field code representing the chart object appears as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      {EMBED Excel.Chart.5 \s}
</PRE>
<P><LI>Edit the field code to appear as follows (delete " \s"):
<P>
<P><PRE>      {EMBED Excel.Chart.5}
</PRE>
<P><LI>With your cursor in the field code, press F9 to update the change to the
   field code.

<P><LI>With your cursor in the field code, press SHIFT+F9 to display the chart
   object.

<P><LI>Size the chart object.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
For more information about problems editing an embedded chart that is an
object in another OLE (object linking and embedding) 2.0 application such
as Word 6.0, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../excel/q108430.htm">Q108430</A></B>
   TITLE     : XL5: Chart Size Changes if Embedded Chart Edited in OLE
               Client

</PRE></OL>NOTE: For more information on the difference between an embedded chart and
a chart sheet, see page 261 in the "Microsoft Excel User's Guide."
<P>
In Word for Windows, the \s switch in an EMBED field returns an embedded
object to its original size when you update the field. When you embed a
Microsoft Excel chart object in a Word document, this switch is
automatically included in the EMBED field for that object. If you remove
the \s switch from the EMBED field, Word does not return the chart object
to its original size when you update the field.
<P>
Note: The \s switch does not apply to a LINK field, so these methods do not
affect a linked Microsoft Excel chart in Word.
