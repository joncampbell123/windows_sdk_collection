The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.3, 4.3-CD, 4.3c, 4.3c-CD
<LI>Microsoft Access, version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you perform a Workstation installation of Microsoft Office for
Windows version 4.3, when you run Microsoft Access, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Can't Update. Database or object is read-only.

</PRE>Additionally, a Microsoft Access directory is not created on your local
hard drive, and the working directory for the Microsoft Access icon is
located on the network drive from which you ran Setup.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Access version 2.0 has 7 files that must be run from a directory
with Read/Write privileges. These files include the Wizard files (files
with names beginning with "WZ and ending with ".MDA"), the UTILITY.MDA
file, and the SYSTEM.MDA file (which contains preferences, and so on).
<P>
When you perform a workstation installation of Microsoft Office, these
files are located on the network server from which you ran Setup. They are
not copied to your local hard drive. Because of this, you receive the error
message described above if you do not have Read/Write access to the
Microsoft Access directory on the server.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, give each network user his or her own copy of
the wizards by copying the library database files to each user's local hard
disk (or personal directory on the server) and modify the MSACC20.INI file.
To do this, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>At an MS-DOS command prompt, type the following commands to copy the
   library database files from the server to each user's local hard disk:
<P>
<P><PRE>      copy f:\access\workdir\wztable.mda c:\access
      copy f:\access\workdir\wzbldr.mda c:\access
      copy f:\access\workdir\wzlib.mda c:\access
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: These commands assume that Microsoft Access is installed in the
   ACCESS directory on network drive F and that each user has Microsoft
   Access installed in the ACCESS directory on drive C. If this is not the
   case, modify the commands to use the correct drives and paths for your
   installation.

<P><LI>Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to open the MSACC20.INI file in
   the Windows directory on each user's local hard disk. Modify the
   following lines
<P>
<P><PRE>      [Libraries]
      F:\ACCESS\WORKDIR\WZLIB.MDA=RW
      F:\ACCESS\WORKDIR\WZTABLE.MDA=RW
      F:\ACCESS\WORKDIR\WZBLDR.MDA=RW
      F:\ACCESS\WORKDIR\WZQUERY.MDA=RW
      F:\ACCESS\WORKDIR\WZFRMRPT.MDA=RW
</PRE><P>
   to read:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [Libraries]
      C:\ACCESS\WZLIB.MDA=RW
      C:\ACCESS\WZTABLE.MDA=RW
      C:\ACCESS\WZBLDR.MDA=RW
      F:\ACCESS\WORKDIR\WZQUERY.MDA=RW
      F:\ACCESS\WORKDIR\WZFRMRPT.MDA=RW
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save and then close the MSACC20.INI file.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
