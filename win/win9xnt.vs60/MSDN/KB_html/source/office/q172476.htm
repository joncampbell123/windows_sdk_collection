JULY 1997
<P>
c 1997 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
<P>
The Microsoft Office 97 Service Release 1 (SR-1) patch is
designed to upgrade your Office 97 installation in place by
updating only those files that have changed in SR-1. The

<P>
<P><h3>Installing The Service Release 1 Patch</h3>
 
<P>
The Office 97 SR-1 patch is a self-contained executable file
(SR1Off97.exe) consisting of only the changes made to Office
files in Office 97 SR-1. When you run the patch, the patch
executable finds the Office 97 files on your computer,
determines which components you currently have installed
from Office 97, writes the SR-1 changes to those files, and
then makes appropriate changes to your Windows Registry.
<P>
<P><h3>Service Release 1 System Requirements</h3>
 
<P>
The SR-1 patch requires the following service packs be
installed before running the patch.

<UL><LI>For computers running Microsoft Windows NT Workstation
   3.51 or Windows NT Server 3.51, install service pack 5.

<LI>For computers running Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0
   or Windows NT Server 4.0, install service pack 2 or
   later.

<LI>No service pack is required for computers running
   Microsoft Windows 95.
<P>
</UL>For more information on installing Windows NT Service Packs,
connect to the Microsoft Windows NT Server Technical Support
page at:
<P>
<B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/ntserversupport/content/servicepacks/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/ntserversupport/content/servicepacks/default.htm</A></B>
<P>
The SR-1 patch requires 32 MB of disk space to run (25 MB if
you run the installer executable SR1Off97.exe from CD or
floppy disk), and adds up to 8 MB of files to your hard
disk.
<P>
<PRE>   These files                             Use this disk space
   -----------------------------------------------------------

   installer executable (SR1Off97.exe)          7 MB
   expanded files                              15 MB
   temporary files used during patching        10 MB
   updated Office files remaining when
     patch is finished                          8 MB

</PRE>The expanded and temporary files are placed in a Windows
temporary folder and removed after the patch is complete.
The updated Office files remain on the disk after the
computer is rebooted.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing the SR-1 Patch On A User Computer</h3>
 
<P>
The SR-1 patch only upgrades computers that have Office 97
applications installed locally. If you are running Office 97
from a network server, you must use the SR-1 Enterprise
Update to upgrade your computer. To update your network
installation of Microsoft Office 97, you need to create a
new administrative installation of Microsoft Office using
the SR-1 Enterprise Update.
<P>
Before installing the SR-1 patch, make sure that you have
installed the required service packs for the operating
system that you are running. See, "Service Release 1 System
Requirements" earlier in this file.
<P>
For computers that have the Windows NT file system (NTFS),
make sure you have administrative privileges; otherwise, the
SR-1 patch will fail while trying to write to the Windows NT
Registry.
<P>
NOTE: If you need any Office components that you do not
currently have installed, install those components on your
computer before installing the SR-1 patch. For more
information, see "Running Office 97 Setup After the SR-1
Patch," later in this file.
<P>
To install the SR-1 patch on a client computer:

<OL><P><LI>Close any open Windows-based applications.

<P><LI>If you are installing the patch from the World Wide Web,
   connect to the Microsoft Office 97 Service Release Web site
   and download the patch executable (SR1Off97.exe) to your hard
   drive.
<P>
<P><PRE>      <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/officefreestuff/office/dlpages/sr1off97.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/OfficeFreeStuff/Office/DLPages/SR1Off97.htm</A></B>
</PRE><P>
   If you are installing the patch from a CD-ROM, insert the CD
   in the CD-ROM drive.
<P>
   If you are installing the patch from floppy disks, insert disk
   1 in drive A or B.

<P><LI>In Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows NT
   Workstation 4.0, click Run on the Start menu, and then type
   path\SR1Off97.exe with the appropriate command-line options,
   or double-click on the SR1Off97.exe file in Windows or Windows
   NT Explorer.
<P>
   In Windows NT Workstation 3.51, click Run on the Program
   Manager or File Manager File menu, and then type
   path\SR1Off97.exe with the appropriate command-line options,
   or double-click on the SR1Off97.exe file in File Manager.
<P>
   For example, if you download the SR1Off97.exe file to folder
   C:\Temp, type
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\Temp\SR1Off97.exe
</PRE><P>
   See "Using Command-Line Options" later in this Readme file for
   information about the various command-line options you can use
   with the patch utility.

<P><LI>Follow the instructions.

<P><LI>If prompted, reboot the computer to complete the process.
<P>
</OL>When the patch finishes, your computer is upgraded to
Office 97 SR-1.
<P>
Similar to Office 97 Setup, you can have users run the patch
themselves, or you can automate the process using the same
techniques described in Chapter 6, "Customizing Client
Installations," in the Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit. See
"For More Information" later in this Readme file for
information on obtaining the Resource Kit.
<P>
The patch executable supports the /Q command-line option,
which installs the patch without user intervention.
<P>
The 7-MB file SR1Off97.exe, which you download from the Web
or run from a CD or floppy disk, is an installer that
contains the patch executable and its associated files in a
compressed format. When you download this file from the Web
and run it, or when you double-click to run it from a CD or
floppy disk, it expands to approximately 15 MB of files on
your hard drive, including the patch executable itself,
Off97SR1.exe. When the patch executable runs, it needs an
additional 10 MB of temporary disk space to update your
Office files. When the patch completes and the computer is
rebooted, up to 8 MB of new and updated Office files remain
on the hard disk.
<P>
By default, the installer program copies the expanded files
into a temporary Windows folder that is deleted when the
patch utility finishes the upgrade process. You can specify
a different destination folder using the /T command-line
option. You can also use the /C command-line option to
direct the installer program to copy only the files to the
temporary folder, so you can run Off97sr1.exe separately.
<P>
<P><h3>Using Command-Line Options</h3>
 
<P>
To use command-line options with the patch installer:

<OL><P><LI>Download the patch installer program (SR1Off97.exe) from the
   Web to your hard drive without running it.
<P>
<P><PRE>    - or -
</PRE><P>
   Copy SR1Off97.exe from CD or floppy disk to your hard drive.
   (You can also run the executable directly from the disk.)

<P><LI>In Windows 95 or Windows NT Workstation 4.0, click Run on the
   Start menu, and then type path\SR1Off97.exe with the
   appropriate command-line options.
<P>
<P><PRE>    - or -
</PRE><P>
   In Windows NT Workstation 3.51, click Run on the Program
   Manager or File Manager File menu, and then type
   path\SR1Off97.exe with the appropriate command-line options.
<P>
   For example, if you have downloaded SR1Off97.exe to a folder
   named C:\Temp, you can run the installer with no user prompts
   by typing the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\Temp\SR1Off97.exe /Q
</PRE><P>
</OL>The installer recognizes the following command-line options:
<P>
<PRE>   Option       Description
   ----------------------------------------------------------

   /Q           Runs in quiet mode; no user prompts are given.
                The patch will not reboot the computer
                automatically; the user must reboot the
                computer manually before the changes will take
                effect.

   /T:path      Changes the default temporary folder to the
                specified path. The installer program uses the
                specified temporary folder for expanding
                files. Folder contents are not deleted when
                the patch executable finishes.

   /C           Extracts files to the folder specified by the
                /T option, but does not run the patch
                executable.

</PRE></OL><h3>SR-1 Patch Log File</h3>
 
<P>
The patch executable records a log of all the actions it
takes. The log file is named 97sr1_0.txt and is created in
the Office subfolder of the Microsoft Office folder (default
is \Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office). If the patch is
run more than once, additional log files are created with
the names 97sr1_1.txt, 97sr1_2.txt, and so forth.
<P>
<P><h3>Running Office 97 Setup After The Sr-1 Patch</h3>
 
<P>
If you need to run Office 97 Setup to add an Office
application (Microsoft Access, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint,
or Word) after running the patch, then you must run the
patch again to update the additional files.
<P>
If you need to run Office 97 Setup to add any individual
components (such as Equation Editor or the Word Address
Book) after running the patch, you cannot run the patch
again to update the additional files. Instead, you may need
to remove Office 97, install it with the additional
components, and then run the patch again. For more
information on adding Office 97 components after running the
SR-1 patch, connect to the Microsoft Technical Support
Knowledge Base at:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q166/6/71.asp">http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q166/6/71.asp</A></B>

</PRE>If you need to return a client computer to the original
Office 97 version, use Office 97 Setup to remove Office and
then install it again.
<P>
To reinstall Office 97 after the SR-1 patch:

<OL><P><LI>Close all Windows-based applications.

<P><LI>In Windows 95 or Windows NT Workstation 4.0, point to Settings
   on the Start menu, and then click Control Panel.
<P>
<P><PRE>    - or -
</PRE><P>
   In Windows NT Workstation 3.51, double-click the Control Panel
   icon in Program Manager.

<P><LI>Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

<P><LI>Double-click Microsoft Office 97, Standard Edition, or
   Microsoft Office 97, Professional Edition.
<P>
   This starts the Office 97 Setup program.

<P><LI>Click Remove All.
<P>
   Setup removes all Office 97 files, including SR-1
   modifications, but leaves any user files created using Office
   97 applications.

<P><LI>Run Setup from the original Office 97 network server, CD, or
   floppy disk to install Office 97. For more information, see
   "Installing Office from the Network" in Chapter 4, "Installing
   Microsoft Office," in the Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit.
<P>
</OL>This will remove all the modifications made to Office files
by the patch and return Office 97 applications to the
original version.
<P>
Some of the system files modified by the patch will remain
on the computer, but this does not affect the operation of
Office 97 or other applications. The following system files
are modified by the SR-1 patch and are not returned to their
original versions when Office 97 is removed and reinstalled.
Do not attempt to manually remove these files because they
are used by Office and other Windows applications.
