<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to use any of the Web features in the Microsoft Office
programs listed at the beginning of this article, and Microsoft Internet
Explorer is installed, you may receive an error message that is similar to
one of the following

<UL><LI>&lt;Program name&gt; caused an invalid page fault in module SHDOCVW.DLL at
   address 014f:71528dd.

<LI>&lt;Program name&gt; caused an invalid page fault in module GDI32.DLL at
   address 014f:bff349d9.

<LI>&lt;Program name&gt; caused an invalid page fault in module KERNEL32.DLL at
   address 014f:bff786a6.
<P>
</UL>where &lt;Program name&gt; is the name of the Microsoft Office program you are
using.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior may occur when one of the following is true:

<UL><LI>One or more cache files in the Temporary Internet Files folder may
   be damaged.

<LI>The History folder or the cache folders used by Internet Explorer are
   damaged.

<LI>The index files used to track the contents of the History or cache
   folders are damaged.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this behavior, use one of the following methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
Delete the Temporary Internet Files folder. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Programs, and then click MS-DOS Prompt.

<P><LI>Type the following line
<P>
<P><PRE>      deltree "c:\&lt;windows&gt;\Temporary Internet Files"
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;windows&gt; is the folder in which you installed Windows. Be sure to
   include the quotation marks. When you are prompted to confirm the
   deletion, press Y, and then press ENTER.

<P><LI>Type "exit" (without the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

<P><LI>Click Start, and then click Run.

<P><LI>In the Open box, type "regsvr32 cachevu.dll" (without the quotation
   marks), and then click OK. This step registers the deleted Temporary
   Internet Files folder again.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
Empty the History and cache folders used by Microsoft Internet Explorer. To
do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Internet Explorer, click Options on the View menu.

<P><LI>Click the Navigation tab, click Clear History under History, and then
   click Yes in the dialog box that appears.

<P><LI>Click the Advanced tab, click Settings under Temporary Internet Files,
   click Empty Folder, and then click Yes in the dialog box that appears.
<P>
   After you perform this step, check to see if the issue has been
   resolved. If it has not been resolved, continue to step 4.

<P><LI>Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel. In Control
   Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.

<P><LI>Click Internet Explorer 3.0 in the list of installed programs, and then
   click Add/Remove.

<P><LI>After you remove Internet Explorer 3.0 or 3.01, restart the computer.
   When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, press the F8 key, and
   then choose Command Prompt Only from the Startup menu.

<P><LI>Type the following commands, pressing ENTER after each command.
<P>
<P><PRE>      cd \windows
      smartdrv
      deltree "Temporary Internet Files"
