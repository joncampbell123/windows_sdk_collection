The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.2, 4.3
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Access, version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use a directory name that contains an extended character with one
of the Microsoft Office applications, one of the following symptoms may
occur:

<UL><LI>You may not be able to start or activate that application by using the
   Microsoft Office Manager (MOM) toolbar. When you start or activate an
   application contained in such a directory, you may receive an error
   message similar to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Cannot find 'EXCEL.EXE'. Please start the application another way.
      While the application is running, click on the toolbar button or
      choose the menu command again.
</PRE>
<LI>When you add an application to the Microsoft Office Manager, and you
   enter a working directory that contains an extended character, you
   receive the following error message
<P>
<P><PRE>      The path &lt;drive:\directory&gt; is invalid. Add anyway?
</PRE><P>
   If you choose OK to this error message, the application will be added to
   the MOM toolbar. However, another error message will occur when you run
   the application:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The working directory is invalid. Add anyway?
</PRE><P>
   If you choose OK to this error message, the working directory is added,
   but when you run the particular application, you receive the following
   error message
<P>
<P><PRE>      Working directory is invalid
</PRE><P>
   and the working directory is ignored.

<LI>When you run the Setup program for one of the applications listed above
   and enter a destination directory name that contains an extended
   character, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The specified directory:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      'C:\&lt;directory&gt;'
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      is invalid because it contains unrecognized special characters.
      Please type a different directory
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems occurs because the Microsoft Office Manager, and the
applications listed above, included with the English-language versions of
Microsoft Office, are not designed to handle directory names that contain
extended characters, such as an acute or a grave accent mark.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To prevent these error messages from occurring, do not include an extended
character in your directory names.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Office 4.0</h3>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office version 4.0 Setup program, you can enter
a destination directory name that contains an extended character for
Microsoft Word without receiving an error message.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Office 4.2 and 4.3</h3>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office version 4.2 or 4.3 Setup program, you can
enter a destination directory name that contains an extended character for
Microsoft Word and for Microsoft PowerPoint without receiving an error
message.
<P>
NOTE: The Microsoft Office Manager application in Microsoft Office does not
support being installed to a directory with a name that contains an
extended character.
