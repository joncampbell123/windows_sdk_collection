The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, versions 4.2, 4.2.1
<LI>Microsoft Excel for the Macintosh, versions 5.0, 5.0a
<LI>Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, versions 6.0, 6.0.1
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for the Macintosh, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive unexpected results if you do any of the following after
installing Microsoft Office or one of the Microsoft Office applications:

<UL><LI>Rename the folder into which you installed Microsoft Office or the
   Microsoft Office application

<LI>Delete or move any files or folders in the System Folder or the
   Microsoft folder that were installed by the Microsoft Office Setup
   program or the Microsoft Office application Setup program.

<LI>Delete or move any of the folders within the Microsoft Office folder or
   the Microsoft Office application folder.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You may receive unexpected results if you perform any of the above actions
because the Setup program records information about the location of these
files and folders. If you move, rename, or delete any of these files or
folders without using the Setup program, the application may behave
unexpectedly because it is not aware of the changes.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use any of the following methods:
<P>
<PRE>Method 1:   To change your Microsoft Office or Microsoft Office application
            installation, run Setup again in maintenance mode, choose the
            Add/Remove button, and then follow the instructions in Setup.

Method 2:   To start an application from a folder other than the folder to
            which it is installed, you can create an alias for the
            application by doing the following:

            a. From the Finder, select the application file that you want
               to start from another location.

            b. From the File menu, choose Make Alias.

            c. Drag the application alias to the folder from which you want
               to start the application.
