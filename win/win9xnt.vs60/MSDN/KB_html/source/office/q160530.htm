<P>
This article lists the network server and client software that is supported
by Microsoft Office 97 for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following network servers and clients were tested with Microsoft Office
97 Setup and the programs included with Microsoft Office 97:
<P>
<PRE>   Server                             Client
   -------------------------------------------------------------------

   Microsoft Windows NT Server        Client for Microsoft Networks

   Microsoft Windows 95 Workstation   Client for Microsoft Networks

   *Novell NetWare, 3.x and 4.x       32-bit NetWare client (see note)

   Banyan Vines 5.52 or later         32-bit Vines client

   Artisoft LANtastic 6.x or later    32-bit LANtastic client

   DEC Pathworks 5.0d or later        32-bit Pathworks client

   IBM LanServer 4.0                  32-bit LanServer client

</PRE>*Note that the client for NetWare Networks that is included with Microsoft
Windows 95 is a 32-bit NetWare client. Novell also ships a 32-bit NetWare
client. The two 32-bit clients from Novell that were tested were Netware
32b client for Microsoft Windows 95, version 2.11, and Netware client for
Microsoft Windows NT beta, version 4.0.
<P>
Note that although these networks have been tested, you may still encounter
problems when you install or use Microsoft Office 97 with any of these
networks. Information that addresses such issues will appear in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as we become aware of the issues.
