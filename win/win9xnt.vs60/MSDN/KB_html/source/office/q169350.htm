</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you run a Visual Basic for Applications macro when working with a
Microsoft Excel 97 section in a Microsoft Office 97 Binder, you may receive
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-time error '28':
   Out of stack space

</PRE>Or, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

</PRE>If you click Details, you receive error messages similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   EXCEL caused an invalid page fault in module KERNEL32.DLL at
   0137:bff9a5d0.

   BINDER caused an exception 6bfH in module KERNEL32.DLL at
   0137:bff9a3c0.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems may occur if the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>The Visual Basic macro you are running contains the FollowHyperlink
   method.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You are running the macro when the Visual Basic Editor is active.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do not run the Visual Basic macro in Microsoft
Office Binder 97 if the Visual Basic Editor is active. If you click the
Microsoft Office Binder 97 window, the problems do not occur.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>

provided 'as is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in

<P>
In Visual Basic for Applications, you can use the FollowHyperlink method to
display a Web page or a Microsoft Office document in the appropriate
program (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer). For example, the following
line of code starts the MSNBC Web site:
<P>
<PRE>   ThisWorkbook.FollowHyperlink ("<B><A href="http://msnbc.com">http://msnbc.com</A></B>")
