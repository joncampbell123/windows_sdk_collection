The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.2c, 4.3c
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office Setup, and you choose the Custom/Complete
Installation option to install all of the Microsoft Office components, the
Setup program does not request the last disk. This is true for both
administrative and local installations.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design of Microsoft Office. The Microsoft Office files
are contained in individual cabinet (*.CAB) files on each of the disks
except the last disk. The last disk contains the Microsoft PowerPoint
Viewer, an application that is available for you to copy and distribute so
that you can view a PowerPoint slide show on a computer that does not have
a full installation of PowerPoint. Because this application has its own
Setup program, and does not use the cabinet file structure that the
Microsoft Office Setup program uses, this disk is not used by the Microsoft
Office Setup program.
<P>
When you perform a complete installation of Microsoft Office, the
PowerPoint Viewer is installed. However, the Setup program copies the
PowerPoint Viewer files from one of the Microsoft Office disks that
contains a cabinet file, instead of the last disk that is not DMF
formatted. The disk that contains the cabinet file that contains the
Microsoft Viewer files depends on the format of the Setup disks that you
are using.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following is a list of the file (the last file in the disk set)
that the Microsoft Office Setup does not use even when you perform a
Complete installation based on the version of Microsoft Office and
the format of the Setup disks.
