<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you upgrade from Windows NT 3.1 to Windows NT 3.5, you may be unable
to print from Microsoft Excel or Word, and you may receive one or more of
the following error messages:
<P>
<PRE>   Windows cannot print due to a problem with the current printer setup.

   -or-

   Word cannot change printers. No printers are installed.

   -or-

   Word cannot print. There is no printer installed.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is caused by incorrect security permissions being written to a
section of the Registry from which some applications get printer data.
Because this section is set to Read Only, new printers are not written to
it and some applications will not be able to access the newly created
printers.
<P>
For more information about this problem, please see the following
article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../winnt/q122919.htm">Q122919</A></B>
   TITLE     : Some Applications Unable to Print After Stop/Restart Spooler

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, change Administrators to Full Control in both the
Devices and PrinterPorts keys, using the Registry Editor as follows:
<P>
NOTE: This problem will occur again if the Spooler service is stopped and
restarted. Use this procedure again if necessary.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

<OL><P><LI>Start Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

<P><LI>From the HKEY_CURRENT_USER subtree, go to the following subkey:
<P>
<P><PRE>      \SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
</PRE>
<P><LI>Select the Devices subkey, and from the menu, choose Security,
   Permissions.

<P><LI>Change Administrators to Full Control, and then choose OK.

<P><LI>Select the PrinterPorts subkey and from the menu, choose Security,
   Permissions.

<P><LI>Change Administrators to Full Control, and then choose OK.

<P><LI>Exit the Registry Editor.

<P><LI>In Print Manager, open the Properties Of A Created Printer dialog box,
   and choose OK.
<P>
   The Created printers will be rewritten to the Registry. Connected To
   Printers must be recreated.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
