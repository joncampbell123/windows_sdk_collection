The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you insert a Microsoft Excel workbook into a document in Microsoft
Word 97 or in a Binder in Microsoft Office Binder 97, you may receive the
following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Excel
   The workbook you are opening contains macros. Some macros may contain
   harmful viruses. If you are sure this workbook is from a trusted
   source, click Yes. If you are not sure and want to prevent any macros
   from running, click No.

</PRE>Note that you receive the same error message twice.
<P>
You may also receive the same error message once when you perform either of
the following actions:

<UL><LI>You switch to a Microsoft Excel workbook that is embedded in a
   Microsoft Word document.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You open an Office Binder that contains a Microsoft Excel workbook.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if any of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You insert a Microsoft Excel workbook that contains macros into either
   a Word document or an Office binder.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>In Word 97, you switch to an embedded workbook that contains macros.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>You open a Binder that contains a workbook that contains macros.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, use one of the following two methods:

<UL><LI>Remove all of the macros from the workbook before you insert it into a
   Word document or a Microsoft Office Binder.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Disable macro virus protection in Microsoft Excel 97. To do this, follow
   these steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>      1. On the Tools menu, click Options.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      2. Click the General tab.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      3. Click to clear the "Macro virus protection" check box, and then
<PRE></PRE>         click OK.

   NOTE: If you do this, you are not warned when you open a workbook that
   contains macros. This makes it possible for Microsoft Excel workbooks to
   become infected with macro viruses if you open a workbook that contains
   one. Use this option with caution.

</PRE></UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The programs included with Microsoft Office 97 that support the use of
Visual Basic for Applications macros also include macro virus protection.
If this feature is selected, you receive a warning message whenever you
open a file (such as a workbook or a document) that contains macros.
<P>
In some cases, you may receive a macro virus warning message twice when you
open a file by using any of the following methods:

<UL><LI>You open the file in the program that created it.

<LI>You insert the file into a document in another program.

<LI>You insert the file into a Microsoft Office Binder by clicking Add
   From File on the Section menu.
<P>
</UL>This behavior occurs because of the way in which the file is opened or
inserted by the program you are currently using.
