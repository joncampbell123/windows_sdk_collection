The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office 97 on a laptop computer or other computer
that uses power management, any of the following problems may occur:

<UL><LI>Even though it is set to do so, your computer may not be automatically
   suspended after a specified period of inactivity.
<P>
   This behavior may be problematic if your computer is powered by a
   battery.

<LI>The Find Fast indexes on your computer may not be updated.

<LI>After you first install Microsoft Office 97, restart the computer, and
   then run the computer by using battery power, the battery may quickly
   run low on power.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The first two problems in the "Symptoms" section occur because Microsoft
Find Fast does not always respond correctly to messages sent by the power
management system. As a result, Find Fast may prevent your computer from
initiating suspended mode, or the computer may suspend itself before Find
Fast finishes indexing files.
<P>
The third problem occurs because Microsoft Find Fast attempts to index all
of the files on the hard disk when you first install Microsoft Office 97 on
a computer. As a result, the entire hard disk must be scanned. This process
requires a substantial amount of power.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use any of the following methods to work around these problems.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1</h3>
 
<P>
If you do not require text searching or other features that use content
indexing, you can remove the Microsoft Find Fast shortcut from the StartUp
group. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Right-click Start. On the shortcut menu, click Open.

<P><LI>In the C:\&lt;Windows&gt;\Start Menu window (where &lt;Windows&gt; is the name of
   the folder in which you installed Microsoft Windows), double-click
   Programs. Then, double-click StartUp.

<P><LI>Click the Microsoft Find Fast shortcut. Then, delete it by pressing
   BACKSPACE or DELETE or by dragging it to the desktop or to another
   folder.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2</h3>
 
<P>
If your computer is not running on battery power, you can turn off the
automatic suspension feature. To do this, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
   Double-click Power.

<P><LI>In the Power tab, click to clear the "Allow Windows to manage power
   use on this computer" check box. Then, click OK.
<P>
   NOTE: You may be required to restart the computer.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 3</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to use Microsoft Find Fast most of the time but turn it off for
the session during which your computer is running on battery power, leave
the Microsoft Find Fast shortcut in the StartUp group. To turn off
Microsoft Find Fast, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.

<P><LI>Double-click Find Fast.

<P><LI>On the Index menu, click Close And Stop.
<P>
</OL>This method turns off Microsoft Find Fast until you restart your computer
or start Microsoft Find Fast again.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 4</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to use Microsoft Find Fast only some of the time, remove it
from the StartUp group by using the instructions in Method 1. Then, when
you want to index files, double-click the Microsoft Find Fast shortcut, and
then click Update Index on the Index menu.
<P>
To prevent battery power from running too low after you install Microsoft
Office 97, Microsoft recommends that you plug the computer into a wall
socket when you install Microsoft Office 97 and after you restart the
computer. The computer should remain plugged into the wall socket until
Microsoft Find Fast has finished indexing files.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
