<P>
<P><h3>Enabling the Real Mode CD-ROM Drive Drivers</h3>
 
<P>
When you enable the real mode CD-ROM drive drivers, you must use the
appropriate method. The method you use depends on whether the Config.sys
file is present on the computer. If no Config.sys file exists, determine
whether the Config.dos file is present on the computer.
<P>
If no Config.sys or Config.dos file is present, or if the file (Config.sys
or Config.dos) does not list a real mode driver, you must contact the CD-
ROM drive or computer vendor for help.
<P>
NOTE: The steps in this section work for a variety of configurations. In
some cases that involve third-party drivers, these steps may not work. If
these steps do not work, consult your CD-ROM drive documentation for
information about loading and using real mode CD-ROM drive drivers.
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Config.sys File Is Present</h3>
 
<P>
To enable the drivers when a Config.sys is present on the computer, do the
following:

<OL><P><LI>On the Start menu, click Run. In the Open box, type "sysedit" (without
   the quotation marks) and click OK.
<P>
   This step starts the System Configuration Editor.

<P><LI>Click the Config.sys window.
<P>
   This step displays the Config.sys window.

<P><LI>Locate the line that loads the real mode CD-ROM drive driver.
<P>
   NOTE: This line contains the following
<P>
<P><PRE>      device=
</PRE><P>
   -and-
<P>
<P><PRE>      /d:&lt;cd rom drive device id&gt;
</PRE>
<P><LI>If you cannot find a Config.sys window in the System Configuration
   Editor, go to the "Method 2: No Config.sys File Is Present" section.

<P><LI>Write down the drive identifier string after "/d:" in the Config.sys
   window. You will need this information later. An example of this
   identifier is MSCD001.

<P><LI>If the "device=" line is remarked (starts with "rem"), remove the word
   "rem."
<P>
   For example, if the line resembles the following
<P>
<P><PRE>      rem device=
</PRE><P>
   change it to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      device=
</PRE>
<P><LI>In the System Configuration Editor, click Exit on the File menu. Click
   Yes when you are prompted to save changes.
<P>
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: No Config.sys File Is Present</h3>
 
<P>
To enable the drivers when no Config.sys is present on the computer, do
the following:

<OL><P><LI>If you started the System Configuration Editor in the previous section,
    close it by clicking Exit on the File menu.

<P><LI>Open an MS-DOS window by clicking Start, pointing to Programs, and then
    clicking MS-DOS Prompt.

<P><LI>To change to the root directory of drive C, type "cd\" (without the
    quotation marks), and then press ENTER.
<P>

<P><LI>Type "dir *.dos" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER.
<P>
    Determine whether the Config.dos file is present. If this file exists,
    it is the original Config.sys file that Windows 95 renamed when you
    installed Windows 95. Note that it may contain the lines listed in step
    3 in the previous section.

<P><LI>If there is no Config.sys but there is a Config.dos file, copy the
    Config.dos file by typing the following at the MS-DOS prompt:
<P>
       copy config.dos config.bak
<P>
    When you are finished typing, press ENTER.

<P><LI>Rename Config.dos to Config.sys by typing the following at the MS-DOS
    prompt:
<P>
       ren config.dos config.sys
<P>
    When you are finished typing, press ENTER.

<P><LI>Edit the Config.sys file by typing the following at the MS-DOS
    prompt:
<P>
       edit config.sys
<P>
    When you are finished typing, press ENTER.
<P>
    The MS-DOS Editor is started and displays the Config.sys file.

<P><LI>Write down the drive identifier string after "/d:" in the Config.sys
    file. You will need this information later. An example of this
    identifier is MSCD001.

<P><LI>If the "device=" line is remarked (starts with "rem"), remove the word
    "rem."
<P>
    For example, if the line resembles the following
<P>
       rem device=
<P>
    change it to the following:
<P>
       device=

<P><LI>In the MS-DOS Editor, click Exit on the File menu. Click Yes
    when you are prompted to save changes.
<P>
</OL><h3>Restarting Microsoft Windows 95 Using Step-by-Step Confirmation</h3>
 
<P>
After you use one of the methods in the previous section to enable the real
mode drivers, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Restart the computer by clicking Shutdown on the Start menu, and then
   clicking Restart The Computer. When the Starting Windows 95 message
   appears, press F8. Then, choose option 5, Step-by-Step Confirmation.

<P><LI>Answer the questions that appear as follows.
<P>
<PRE>      Question                         Answer
      --------------------------------------------------------------------

      Load doublespace driver?         NO (unless the drive is compressed)
      Process System Registry?         YES
      Create a Startup Log File?       NO
      Process Startup Device Drivers?  YES

</PRE><P><LI>When you are prompted, choose NO for all prompts that appear except for
   Himem.sys, Ifshlp.sys, the real mode CD-ROM drive driver, and any
   necessary third-party drivers.
<P>
   If you are not sure if a driver is necessary, or if you do not know what
   the driver or prompt is, choose NO. Because this is an interactive
   process, no files are changed or lost. If you answer incorrectly,
   you can restart the computer.
<P>
   NOTE: Some third-party programs (for example, Sound Blaster) provide
   more than one file that pertain to the CD-ROM drive. These programs
   often include one file that provides the CD-ROM drive capabilities, one
   file that provides the sound capabilities, and a third file that
   provides the multimedia capabilities. You need only the CD-ROM drive
   driver. The other files provide additional capabilities but do not
   affect the ability to access and read the CD-ROM drive.

<P><LI>Answer the questions that appear as follows.
<P>
<PRE>      Question                                    Answer
      --------------------------------------------------

      Load the Windows graphical user interface?  NO
      WIN?                                        NO

</PRE><P><LI>To change to the root directory of drive C, type "cd\" (without the
   quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

<P><LI>Type the following
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\windows\command\mscdex /d: &lt;CD-ROM ID&gt; /L:
     &lt;CD-ROM drive letter&gt; /s
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;CD-ROM ID&gt; is the CD-ROM identifier string you wrote down and
   &lt;CD-ROM drive letter&gt; is your CD-ROM drive letter (usually D), and
   then press ENTER.
<P>
   For example, the command you type should resemble the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>       c:\windows\command\mscdex /d:mscd001 /L:d /s
</PRE><P>
</OL>Nonstandard Installation of Windows 95:
<P>
If Windows 95 is not installed in the Windows folder, you must determine
where the Mscdex file is located. To find the Mscdex file, switch to the
root directory using an MS-DOS prompt and type the following command:
<P>
<PRE>      dir mscdex*.* /s

</PRE></OL>After you locate the Mscdex file, change the current directory to the
location in which the Mscdex file is stored and type the mscdex command.
<P>
For example, assume that Windows 95 is installed in a folder called Win95.
You would type "cd\win95" (without the quotation marks), and then press
ENTER to change to the Win95 directory. The MS-DOS prompt becomes
c:\win95&gt;. At this prompt, type "mscdex/d:mscd001 /L:d /s" (without the
quotation marks), and then press ENTER.
<P>
<P><h3>Restarting Windows 95 in Safe Mode with CD-ROM Drive Support</h3>
 
<P>
After you follow the steps in the earlier sections, you can restart
Windows in Safe mode and retain CD-ROM drive support. To restart in Safe
mode, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>To start Windows 95 in Safe mode with CD-ROM support, type the following
   command at the MS-DOS prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      win /d:m
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: If you are attempting to perform an administrative installation
   (setup /a) of Microsoft Office to a network server and you need to start
   Windows in Safe mode with both CD-ROM drive and network support, type
   the following command instead:
<P>
<P><PRE>      win /d:n
</PRE>
<P><LI>Run the Microsoft Office Setup program. Click Start, and then click Run.
   In the Open box, type the following
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;CD-ROM drive letter&gt;\setup
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;CD-ROM drive letter&gt; is your CD-ROM drive letter (usually, this
   is drive D).
<P>
</OL>If you are unable to run Setup or successfully use your real mode CD-ROM
drive drivers, you can find more information in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base. For additional information, please see the following articles in the
