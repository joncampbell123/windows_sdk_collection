kbenv
<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Excel for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Word for Windows 95, version 7.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT, version 3.51
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry, including files in the \Winnt\System32\Config folder.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you click AutoCorrect on the Tools menu in an Office program, the
text AutoCorrect entries fail to appear in the AutoCorrect dialog box.
However, some AutoCorrect entries that are not text-based appear in
the AutoCorrect dialog box in Microsoft Word.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>Your computer is running Windows NT, version 3.51, and you log on as
   the Administrator of the computer.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You install Microsoft Office for Windows 95.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You log off the computer, and then log on to the computer as a member of
   the Users or Guests group as defined in the User Manager tool.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You start an Office program, and you click AutoCorrect on the Tools
   menu.
<P>
</UL>This problem occurs because, as a member of the Users or Guests group, you
do not have permission to write the AutoCorrect key in the registry. This
problem also occurs if you log on to the computer as a member of any group
except the Administrators group.
<P>
This problem does not occur if you use Windows 95 because the Windows 95
security model does not attach permissions to registry entries.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall Windows NT. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
before you edit the registry.
<P>
To work around this problem, use the registry editor to give the user
permissions to the AutoCorrect key in the registry before you log on to the
computer as a user. To do this, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Log on to the computer as the Administrator of the computer.

<P><LI>Double-click the Windows NT desktop to bring up the Task List dialog
    box.

<P><LI>In the New Task box, type "regedt32" (without the quotation marks), and
    press ENTER.

<P><LI>On the Window menu, click HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.

<P><LI>Open the following key:
<P>
       Software\Microsoft\Shared Tools\AutoCorrect

<P><LI>Double-click the AutoCorrect subkey to select it.

<P><LI>On the Security menu, click Permissions.

<P><LI>In the Names list, click Everyone.

<P><LI>In the Type Of Access list, click Full Control, and click OK.

<P><LI>In the Registry Key Permissions dialog box, select the Replace
    Permission on Existing Subkeys check box, and click OK.
<P>
</OL>When you log on to the computer as a user, you must remove the AutoCorrect
key in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER on Local Machine and remove the blank
AutoCorrect file (ACL). To do this, use the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Log on to the computer as the User of the computer.

<P><LI>Double-click the Windows NT desktop to bring up the Task List dialog
   box.

<P><LI>In the New Task box, type "regedt32" (without the quotation marks) and
   press ENTER.

<P><LI>On the Window menu, click HKEY_CURRENT_USER.

<P><LI>Open the following key:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Software\Microsoft\Microsoft Office\95\AutoCorrect
</PRE>
<P><LI>Delete this key.

<P><LI>On the Registry menu, click Exit.

<P><LI>Start File Manager and delete the AutoCorrect file in the directory
   where Windows NT is installed. The file name includes your login name
   and has an .acl extension, for example the file may have a name similar
   to User000.acl.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem
and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you install Office, the Setup program installs the AutoCorrect "base"
file, Msoffice.acl in the directory in which you installed Windows NT. In
addition, the location is written to the following location in the
registry:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Shared Tools\AutoCorrect key

</PRE></OL>When you start an Office program, the program searches the following key
for user AutoCorrect .acl file:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Microsoft Office\95\Autocorrect key

</PRE>If the user's .acl file does not exist, the program attempts to copy and
rename the "base" file to the user .acl file.
<P>
NOTE: If you install multiple versions of Microsoft Office, there may be
multiple user .acl files in the Windows directory.
