<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you upgrade to Office 97 or one of the Office 97 programs, you may
find that the behavior of the Setup program differs from earlier versions
of the Microsoft Office upgrade Setup program. This article discusses the
upgrade process and how it works.
<P>
NOTE: This article discusses the Microsoft Office 97 upgrade process.
However, the information presented in this article applies to the Setup
programs for the individual Microsoft Office 97 programs.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
During setup, after you enter your name and company and obtain your product
identification number, you will receive a dialog box prompting you to
accept C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office as the destination folder for all
of the Microsoft Office 97 program files. This is the default folder
whether you upgrade from an earlier version of Microsoft Office or install
Microsoft Office for the first time.
<P>
To change the folder to which Office is installed, click the Change Folder
button, and select a different folder. If the Setup program detects files
from an earlier version of Microsoft Office, Setup will ask if you would
like to remove the program files that belong to the earlier version.
Therefore, it is not necessary to change the folder to the earlier version
of Microsoft Office to remove the old files.
<P>
After you select the type of installation that you would like (for example
Custom, Typical, Run From Server, or Run From CD), you will receive the
following message if you are upgrading from Microsoft Office versions 4.x
or 95:
<P>
<PRE>   The Microsoft Office Upgrade Wizard has detected one or more Office
   4.x or 95 components on your computer. Removing these components is
   recommended and will not affect your existing data. Remove ALL old
   Office 4.x and 95 components now?

</PRE><h3>What Applications Will the Upgrade Wizard Remove?</h3>
 
<P>
The Upgrade Wizard determines which programs are currently installed,
creates a list of files and settings used by those programs, and then
removes them.
<P>
The table below illustrates which program files the Upgrade Wizard will
remove if you click Yes to remove old Office 4.x and 95 components.
<P>
If you're
using the Setup
<PRE>program for this             The Upgrade Wizard removes this

                    Access         Excel        PowerPoint       Word
                   2.x and 95    5.x and 95     4.x and 95     6.x and 95

</PRE>Microsoft Office 97

Microsoft Word 97                                                  x

Microsoft PowerPoint 97                              x


</PRE>When you use Setup for these programs and click Yes to remove the Office
4.x and 95 components, all of the components will be removed.
<P>
For example, when you run Setup for Microsoft Office 97 Professional, if
you select Custom installation, clear the option for PowerPoint components,
and then click Yes to remove the Office 4.x and 95 components, all of the
earlier Office components will be removed including the earlier version of
PowerPoint. In other words, the Upgrade Wizard does not determine which
components to remove based on the components you select during a Custom
installation of Microsoft Office 97.
<P>
<P><h3>Running Microsoft Office 97 with Microsoft Office 4.x or 95</h3>
 
<P>
We do not recommend that you run multiple versions of Microsoft Office
under the same installation of Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows
NT. However, if you want to keep some, but not all, of the earlier
Microsoft Office components, use either of the following methods:
<P>
<P><h3>Method 1: Run Setup</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Run Setup for the earlier version of Microsoft Office.

<P><LI>Click the Add/Remove button in Setup.

<P><LI>Click to clear the check box for the component that you want to remove
   and click Continue.

<P><LI>Click OK to remove the components that you've selected.

<P><LI>When Setup for the earlier version of Office is done, run Setup for
   Microsoft Office 97. If the Upgrade Wizard prompts you to remove the
   Office 4.x and 95 components, click No.
<P>
</OL><h3>Method 2: Use the Upgrade Wizard</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Run the Microsoft Office Upgrade Wizard (Offcln97.exe). The Upgrade
   Wizard is located in the ValuPack\OffClean folder of the Microsoft
   Office 97 CD-ROM.

<P><LI>Select the "Remove old Office components of your choice" option.

<P><LI>In the Upgrade Wizard, select those Office 4.x or 95 components that
   you want to remove.

<P><LI>After the Upgrade Wizard removes the selected Microsoft Office 4.x and
   95 components, run Setup for Microsoft Office 97. During setup, if the
   Upgrade Wizard prompts you to remove the Office 4.x and 95 components,
   click No.
<P>
</OL>When you install Microsoft Office 97, menu items on the Start menu that
belong to Microsoft Office 95 programs are overwritten with menu items that
belong to Microsoft Office 97 programs. You must recreate the Start menu
items for the earlier programs.
