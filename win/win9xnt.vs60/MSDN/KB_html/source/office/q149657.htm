</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Office for Windows 95 and Microsoft Office 97 contain Binder
wizards. A Binder wizard is basically a Binder template that contains
macros to help you use the Binder sections. A Binder wizard file has the
extension .obz. The icon for a Binder wizard file differs slightly from
that of a Binder template (.obt file extension) or of a Binder document
(.obd file extension). The Binder wizard icon has a magician's wand with
small stars around it to signify it is a wizard file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You create a Binder wizard template just like you create a Binder template,
except that you include one or more sections with macros. These macros can
either be Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word macros. However, in order to
write these macros, you must work on the sections that contain the macro
code outside of the binder. This is because you cannot work on macros
within a binder.
<P>

Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : OFF: "Auto" Macros Don't Run When You Activate Binder
               Section

</PRE>Once you have added all of the sections to your Binder, do the following to
make it a Binder Wizard:

<OL><P><LI>On the File menu, click Save Binder As.

<P><LI>In the Save Binder As dialog box, click the destination folder for
   the Binder wizard template file.
<P>
   In Microsoft Office for Windows 95, the best location is the
   \MSOffice\Templates\Binders folder, as this folder appears in the New
   dialog box.
<P>
   In Microsoft Office 97, the best location is the
   \Program Files\Microsoft Office\Templates\Binders folder.

<P><LI>In the Save As Type list, click Binder Templates (*.obt,*.obz).

<P><LI>Enter a file name with a .obz extension. This ensures that the
   file gets the correct Binder wizard icon.

<P><LI>Click Save.
<P>
</OL>To create a new binder based on your Binder wizard template file, click New
Binder on the File menu, or click Start a New Document on the Office
Shortcut Bar. When the New dialog box appears, click the Binders tab, and
then double-click the icon for your file.
<P>
Microsoft Office for Windows 95 also ships with a sample Binder Wizard
file, "Client Billing.obz", which is located in the
MSOffice\Templates\Binders folder. It is a Binder setup that allows you to
create documents including invoices, cover letters, timecards, materials
cards, attachments, and fax cover sheets that each have the same
professionally designed format. (This file is not included with Microsoft
Office 97.)
