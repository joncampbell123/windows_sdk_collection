Pack without having Microsoft Access version 7.0 on your system.

<P><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Setup program for Microsoft Office Small Business
Pack for Windows 95, if Microsoft Access for Windows 95, version 7.0,
is not installed on your computer, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup could not find Microsoft Access installed on your system.
   Please install Microsoft Access before installing this application.

</PRE>The Small Business Pack Setup program requires that Microsoft Access
7.0 be installed on your computer because the database files included
with Small Business Pack can only be used with Microsoft Access 7.0.
<P>
The modified Sbp.stf setup file included with this Application Note
allows you to install Small Business Pack without having Microsoft
Access 7.0 installed on your computer.
<P>
<P><h2>USING THE MODIFIED SBP.STF FILE</h2>
 
<P>
To use the Sbp.stf file, copy it to your hard disk, run the Setup
program for Small Business Pack, and use the /T switch to specify that
Setup should use the modified .stf file.
<P>
<P><h3>To copy the modified .stf file to your hard disk</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>If you received a disk with this Application Note, insert the
   Wc1270 disk in the appropriate floppy disk drive.
<P>
   If you downloaded this Application Note from an online service,
   skip to the "To use the modified .stf to install Small Business
   Pack" section of this document. This procedure assumes that you
   have already downloaded and extracted the compressed file.

<P><LI>Copy the Sbp.stf file to an empty folder on your hard disk.
<P>
</OL><h3>To use the modified .stf to install Small Business Pack</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Insert Disk 1 of the Microsoft Office Small Business Pack disks in
   the appropriate floppy disk drive.

<P><LI>On the Start menu, click Run, and type the following in the Open
   box
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;source&gt;:\Setup /t &lt;location&gt;\sbp.stf
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;source&gt; is the letter of the drive that contains Disk 1 of
   Microsoft Office Small Business Pack and &lt;location&gt; is the path to
   the modified Sbp.stf file. For example, if Disk 1 is in drive A,
   and C:\Temp is the path to the folder that contains the Sbp.stf
   file, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      a:\setup /t c:\temp\sbp.stf
</PRE><P>
  NOTE: If the path for the source or the location contains long file
  names, you must enclose the entire path in quotation marks.
<P>
</OL>The Setup program will install Small Business Pack without error.
<P>
<P><h2>WHAT TO DO IF YOU INSTALL MICROSOFT ACCESS 7.0 AFTER YOU USE THIS FILE</h2>
 
<P>
If you install Microsoft Access 7.0 and would like to install the
Microsoft Access databases that come with the Microsoft Small Business
Pack, use the following steps to remove and then reinstall the
Microsoft Small Business Pack:

<OL><P><LI>Run Small Business Pack Setup.

<P><LI>Click the Remove All button to remove Microsoft Small Business Pack
   from your hard disk.

<P><LI>Run Setup again from the Small Business Pack disks (when you run
   Setup this way, you will access the original Setup.stf file).
<P>
</OL>All of the Small Business Pack components, including the Microsoft
Access 7.0 components, will be installed.
