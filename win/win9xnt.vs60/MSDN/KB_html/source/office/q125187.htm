The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for the Power Macintosh, version 4.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run Microsoft Office for the Power Macintosh Setup in
maintenance mode, and you choose to remove components, some of the
components that you choose to remove are not removed from your hard disk
drive.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs when you install the Microsoft Office for the Power
Macintosh upgrade without first removing the Microsoft Office for the
Macintosh files.
<P>
When you install Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, a counter is
incremented for each component that you choose to install. If you install
Microsoft Office for the Power Macintosh, without removing the Microsoft
Office for the Macintosh files first, the counter for each component that
you install is incremented again. When you run the Microsoft Office Setup
program in maintenance mode, and you choose to remove a component, the
component is only removed if the counter for that component is one. If the
counter for that component is greater than one, the counter decrements by
one, and the component is not removed.
<P>
This means that if you install the Microsoft Office for the Power Macintosh
Upgrade package, without removing the Microsoft Office for the Macintosh
files first, when you run the Microsoft Office Setup program again in
maintenance mode, and you choose to remove a component, that component may
not be removed.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUNDS</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid these problems, do the following to install Microsoft Office for
the Power Macintosh when Microsoft Office for the Macintosh is installed on
your computer:

<OL><P><LI>Run the Microsoft Office Setup program in maintenance mode. Choose the
   Remove All button.

<P><LI>Insert the Microsoft Office for the Power Macintosh Installation Disk 1
   in your floppy disk drive. Run Setup from Installation Disk 1.

<P><LI>Choose the installation type that you want to use. Continue with the
   Setup program.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Not all of the Microsoft Office for the Power Macintosh disks will be
requested during Setup. The Microsoft Office for the Power Macintosh
upgrade package ships with eleven disks: Install Disk 1, and Install Disks
30-40. The upgrade package compliments the 68K version of Microsoft Office
version 4.2, which was shipped with 29 disks.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The above information about installing Microsoft Office for the Power
Macintosh upgrade if Microsoft Office for the Macintosh is installed on
your computer is documented in the "Readme Before Installing" file on the
Microsoft Office for the Power Macintosh Install Disk 1. However, this
information is not contained in the Cover letter that is shipped in the
Microsoft Office for the Power Macintosh upgrade package.
