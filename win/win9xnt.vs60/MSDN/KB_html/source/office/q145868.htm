The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Office 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Word 97 for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0

</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you set up Microsoft Office on a computer running Windows NT version
3.51 or 4.0, the Setup program fails to recognize that Lotus cc:Mail is
installed, and it also fails to prompt you to use Lotus cc:Mail with
Office. After you set up Microsoft Office, the Send command is missing from
the File menu in the Office programs listed above.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when the following conditions are met:

<UL><LI>You set up Lotus cc:Mail before you install Office.
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You are using Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 or 4.0.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: If you are using Microsoft Windows 95, Office Setup recognizes
cc:Mail version 2.21.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem occurs when you use
Microsoft Office and Lotus cc:mail. We are researching this problem and
will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Behavior of the Send Command After You Upgrade</h3>
 
<P>
If you upgrade an earlier version of an Office program, the Send command
may still appear on the File menu. However, the command does not work
properly under Windows NT 3.51 or 4.0.
<P>
If you click the Send command, one of the following messages may appear:

<UL><LI>Mail Is Not Installed On This System
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Mail Could Not Connect to Your Mail Server
<P>
</UL><h3>MAPI and VIM Client Support</h3>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Office programs are designed to work with a 32-bit messaging
application programming interface (MAPI) client, such as Microsoft
Exchange, on both Windows 95 and Windows NT. Office 7.0 does not support a
16-bit MAPI client on Window 95 or Windows NT. Support for 16-bit Vendor
Independent Messaging (VIM) clients, such as Lotus cc:Mail, depend on the
operating system that you are using.
<P>
Windows NT:
<P>
Office programs do not support 16-bit VIM programs on a computer running
Windows NT.
<P>
Windows 95:
<P>
Office programs do support 16-bit (VIM) programs on a computer running
Windows 95.
<P>
Office supports VIM 1.0 on a computer running Windows 95. VIM 1.0 is not
supported on a computer running Windows NT 3.51 or 4.0. VIM 1.0 allows you
to use the Send and Add/Edit Routing Slip commands on the File menu in
Office to send or route Office documents with e-mail programs that support
VIM 1.0 such as Lotus cc:Mail.
<P>
NOTE: If you are using Lotus Notes Mail and Microsoft Office version 7.0,
you may receive an error when trying to log into Lotus Notes. To resolve
this issue, remove Microsoft Office version 7.0 from your computer and
install either Microsoft Office version 7.0b or Microsoft Office 97.
