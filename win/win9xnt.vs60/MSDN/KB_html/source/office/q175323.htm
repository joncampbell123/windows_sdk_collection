The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office version 97 Professional Edition for Windows
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.
<P>
If you install Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition on a Windows NT
Workstation, and then log on to the same computer as a different user and
install Office 97 again, the installation maintenance screen appears. When
you click Reinstall, the Setup program copies files; however after you
receive the message that Setup is updating your system, you receive the
following error:
<P>
<PRE>   Accwiz.dll was unable to register itself in the system registry.

</PRE>When you click OK, you receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Microsoft Office 97 Setup was not completed successfully.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when both of the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>You have installed Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition on
   a computer running Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 or 4.0 after logging on as
   a user who is a member of the Users group, but who is not a member of
   the Administrators group.

<LI>You are reinstalling Microsoft Office 97 on the same computer after
   logging on as a different user who is a member of the Users group, but
   who is not a member of the Administrators group.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you want more than one user to run Office 97 Professional on a Windows
NT 4.0 Workstation computer, a member of the Administrators group should
install it first. This allows different users to run Office programs
without having to run Setup.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Office 97
Professional Edition. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start User Manager on a computer running Microsoft Windows NT
   Workstation.

<P><LI>On the User menu, click New User.

<P><LI>In the New User dialog box, type "User1" (without the quotation marks)
   in the Username box. If the User Must Change Password At Next Logon
   check box is selected, click to clear it.

<P><LI>Make sure that User1 is a member of the Users group but is not a member
   of the Administrators group. Then click OK.

<P><LI>Repeat steps 3 and 4 to create the second user called User2.

<P><LI>Log on as User1 and run Setup to install Microsoft Office 97
   Professional Edition.

<P><LI>Log on as User2 and run Setup again.

<P><LI>When the installation maintenance screen appears, click Reinstall. Note
   that the Setup program copies files; however, after you receive the
   message that Setup is updating your system, you receive the error
   described in the Symptoms section.
