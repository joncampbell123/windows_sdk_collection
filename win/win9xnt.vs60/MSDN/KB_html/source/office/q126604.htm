<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Microsoft Office Setup program located on a network server
drive, you may receive the following error message
<P>
<PRE>   The Setup file shown below is already open in another application.
   You'll need to close it before running setup again.

   &lt;folder&gt;:Install Disk 1:Setup Folder:MS File"

</PRE>where &lt;folder&gt; is the folder on the network that contains the Microsoft
Office Setup program that you are running.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs if another user is running the Microsoft Office Setup
program on the network server computer at the same time. If you perform an
administrative installation of Office to a network server drive (mode 1 so
that users can install Office FROM the network server), and you then run
Setup at that network server, the Setup file on the network server drive is
locked by the network server computer, because this computer is the "owner"
of the shared folder and has write privileges to the shared folder.
<P>
While Setup is being run on the network server computer, you receive the
error message listed above when you run Setup from another workstation,
even if you have only See Files and See Folders privileges to the shared
folder.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid this behavior, do not run Setup on the network server
computer, or make sure that no other user will be running Setup from
their workstation while you are running Setup on the network server
computer.
