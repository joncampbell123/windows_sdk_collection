The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, version 4.2
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you install Microsoft Office for the Macintosh, and you then upgrade
your system to System 7.5, if you run the Safe Install Utility that is
shipped on the Before You Install disk, the utility flags the Microsoft
Office Manager (MOM) as an application that is incompatible, and asks to
move it to the "May Not Work With System 7.5?" folder.
<P>
Additionally, if you choose to move MOM to this folder, MOM does not
appear on the menu bar after you install System 7.5.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because the Microsoft Office Manager is not
included in the list of applications that the System 7.5 Safe Install
Utility uses to check compatible applications. Any application that
is not in this list is flagged as incompatible when you run the Safe
Install Utility.
<P>
If you choose to move MOM to the "May Not Work With System 7.5?"
folder, MOM does not appear on the menu bar when you restart your
computer because the Microsoft Office Manager file must be located in
the System Folder: Control Panel folder to run automatically.
<P>
Note that MOM is compatible with System 7.5; you can run MOM and any other
Microsoft Office version 4.2 application under System 7.5.
