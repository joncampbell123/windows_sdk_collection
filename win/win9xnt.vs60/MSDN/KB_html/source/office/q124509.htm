<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.2, 4.3
<LI>Microsoft Office for Windows 95, version 7.0
   (under Microsoft Windows NT only)
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the Batch/Quiet mode (/Q) installation to set up Microsoft
Office, you can indicate what Program Manager group you want Microsoft
Office 4.2 and 4.3 to be installed to. To do this, you must edit a copy of
the setup table file (SETUP.STF).
<P>
NOTE: This only applies to Microsoft Office for Windows 95 under Microsoft
Windows NT with the standard user interface.
<P>
WARNING: This modification may not be supported by Microsoft Product
Support Services (PSS). PSS will support some modifications to a BACKUP
copy of the SETUP.STF file. Note also that while PSS may help customers
modify specific lines of an STF, we will not rewrite the entire file in
order to achieve a desired configuration. As a general rule, support is
limited to options that can normally be changed by a user during a standard
installation of the application.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To make the appropriate changes to the STF file, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Make a copy of the SETUP.STF file in the administrative setup of
   Microsoft Office, then open the copy in Microsoft Excel.

<P><LI>Select cell A1 and choose Replace from the Edit menu in Microsoft Excel
   versions 5.0 or 7.0. (If you are using Microsoft Excel version 4.0,
</OL>choose
<PRE>   Replace from the Formula menu.)

</PRE></OL>NOTE: Microsoft Excel 4.0 should not be used to make modifications to the
SETUP.STF file for Microsoft Office for Windows 95.

<OL><P><LI>For Microsoft Office for Windows 95 in the "Find What" box, type
   &lt;Microsoft Office&gt; (include both angle brackets &lt; &gt;). In the "Replace
   With" box, type the group name you want Microsoft Office and its
   applications installed to. Enclose this name in angle brackets:
   &lt;Group Name&gt;. After you enter the group name in the appropriate
   manner, choose  Replace All.
<P>
   For Microsoft Office 4.x, enter "Microsoft Office" (include the
   quotation marks). In the "Replace With" box, type the group name you
   want Microsoft Office and its applications installed to. Enclose
   this name in quotation marks. After you enter the group name in the
   appropriate manner, choose  Replace All.
<P>
   IMPORTANT: The group name you type in the "Replace With" box MUST be
   enclosed in quotation marks for Microsoft Office 4.x (for example,
   "Office 4.3") or angle brackets for Microsoft Office 7.0 (for example,
   &lt;Office 7.0&gt;). If those additional characters are omitted, Setup
   fails to complete successfully.
<P>
   Microsoft Excel changes each occurrence of "Microsoft Office" or
   &lt;Microsoft Office&gt; in the copy of SETUP.STF. If you are using Microsoft
   Office 4.x, please note that the Microsoft Office Manager (MOM) icon is
   labeled "Microsoft Office", and is renamed when you perform the global
   search and replace. This does not apply to Microsoft Office 7.0.

<P><LI>To change the label for the icon back to "Microsoft Office", do the
   following:
<P>
   a. In the copy of SETUP.STF, select column A (press F5, and in the
<P><PRE>      Reference box in the Goto dialog box, type "A:A" [without the
      quotation marks] and choose OK).
</PRE><P>
   b. With the column selected, click Find on the Edit menu (in
<P><PRE>      Microsoft Excel 4.0, click Find on the Formula menu).
</PRE><P>
   c. In the Find What box, type the appropriate number from the table
<P><PRE>      below) for the version of Office that you are using, and then click
      the Find Next button:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         Version of Office   Type this number
         -----------------   ----------------

              4.3                 4993
              4.2                 5190

      Microsoft Excel finds a line in the STF resembling the following:

          Mom ProgMan  AddProgmanItem "Office 4.3", "Office 4.3",
         "%s\msoffice.exe", ""


      The second argument in this line is the icon label (that is, the
      second occurrence of "Office 4.3", in this case).

   d. Change the icon label argument from "Office 4.3" to "Microsoft
      Office" as in the following example:

         Mom ProgMan AddProgmanItem  "Office 4.3", "Microsoft Office",
         "%s\msoffice.exe", ""

      Note that in the STF this entry appears on one single line.

</PRE><P><LI>Save the file as a tab-delimited text file.
<P>
</OL>To use the edited STF file, click Run on the File menu in Program manager,
and type the following in the Command Line box
<P>
<PRE>   SETUP /T &lt;path to modified STF&gt; /Q

</PRE></OL>where &lt;path to modified STF is the path to the STF that you edited.
