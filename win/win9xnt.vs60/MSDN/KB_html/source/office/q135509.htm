<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you drag a Microsoft Office file into the Windows Briefcase, if you
make changes to both the original copy of the file, and the copy of the
file in the Briefcase, you can only replace either copy with the other;
you cannot merge the changes made to both copies.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Briefcase is a tool in Windows that you can use to synchronize files on
different computers. You can drag a file into Briefcase, copy the
Briefcase to another computer, make changes either to the file inside the
Briefcase or to the original file, and use Briefcase to update the file
that has not been changed. When you update a file in Briefcase, you can
either replace the file inside the Briefcase, or the original file, or
skip the update.
<P>
However, if changes have been made to both the original file, and the
file inside the Briefcase, you cannot choose to merge the changes, or
accept the changes to both the files. You can only replace one file with
the other, or skip the update so that the changes in both files remain.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior when you drag your Office file to the
Briefcase, do one of the following:
<P>
<P><h3>If one file has changed</h3>
 
<P>
Make changes to one file at a time. For example, when you make a change
to the original file, update the file using the Briefcase before making a
change to the copy inside the Briefcase.
<P>
<P><h3>If both files have changed</h3>
 
<P>
When both the original file and the file inside the Briefcase have
changed, you must open both files individually to compare the
differences. In Microsoft Word, you can use the Compare Versions option
to compare the two different copies and accept the changes that you want
to keep.
<P>
