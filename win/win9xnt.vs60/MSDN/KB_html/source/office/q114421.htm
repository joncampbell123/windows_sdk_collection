<P>
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Office for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.2, 4.3
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible to run Microsoft Office on a nondedicated network server
(where you performed a network installation of Microsoft Office) if both of
the following are true:

<UL><LI>The nondedicated server is running Microsoft Windows version 3.1, or
   Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You install Microsoft Office to a directory other than the network
   installation directory on the nondedicated server.
<P>
</UL>Note that it may also be necessary to change the attributes of the post-
network installation Microsoft Office files on the nondedicated network
server to "Read-Only."
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Some networking software has the feature of allowing a network server to
also function as a workstation. This type of workstation/network server is
usually called a "nondedicated network server" and the type of network is
called a "peer-to-peer" network. This networking feature is built in to
Microsoft Windows for Workgroups. Network users at the nondedicated server
may also need to run applications that are shared on their computers for
others.
<P>
Assuming that an administrative installation of Microsoft Office was
successfully completed on the nondedicated server, do the following to set
up Microsoft Office so that you can run the program on the nondedicated
server:

<OL><P><LI>To avoid accidentally changing the post-network installation Office
   files at the nondedicated server, it is recommended that you change the
   file attributes of these files so that they cannot be deleted or
   modified. This also applies to all files in subdirectories of the
   post-network installation. Check your network software documentation
   for information on how to do this.
<P>
   If you are using Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, you can do this in
   File Manager by selecting the files to change, and choosing the
   Properties command from the File menu or by using the "ATTRIB" command
   at the MS-DOS prompt. See your MS-DOS or Microsoft Windows for
   Workgroups documentation for more details.

<P><LI>From the nondedicated server, run File Manager. Select the local
   drive and directory where the network/administrative installation
   was performed.

<P><LI>Double-click the SETUP.EXE file.

<P><LI>When the Microsoft Office Setup program suggests a destination
   directory for each of the Microsoft Office applications (Microsoft
   Office Manager, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Word, and Microsoft
   Excel) it is essential to specify directories other than where the
   administrative installation of Microsoft Office is located. Using new
   directories is the best option (that is, "C:\MYOFF",
   "C:\MYOFF\POWERPNT", "C:\MYOFF\WORD", "C:\MYOFF\EXCEL").
<P>
</OL>This procedure copies files locally to the new directories to allow the
user at the nondedicated server to run Microsoft Office without affecting
other users that are running a network installation of Microsoft Office
from the server.
<P>
NOTE: To perform a network installation (Setup /A) to the nondedicated
server, the best method is to run the Setup program from a remote
workstation that is connected to the nondedicated server. This method is
recommended because you cannot connect from one computer to a network drive
that is on the same computer.
<P>
You can perform a network installation of Microsoft Office (SETUP /A in
Step 3 above) FROM the nondedicated server TO the same server; however,
when you do this type of installation, you will encounter the following
issues:

<OL><P><LI>The net connection information is not available on a server that is
   running Windows for Workgroups because you cannot connect to a network
   drive that exists on your own computer.

<P><LI>The shared applications (MSAPPS), such as Microsoft Graph and Microsoft
   Draw will be copied to the local drive on the nondedicated server.

<P><LI>When you run the Setup program, you will have to fill in the
   confirmation dialog box for the network information based on what a
   "normal" workstation user will see.

<P><LI>The performance in the nondedicated server is "different" from all the
   other workstations that are running a workstation installation of
   Microsoft Office, and will not take advantage of universal naming
   convention (UNC) paths.
