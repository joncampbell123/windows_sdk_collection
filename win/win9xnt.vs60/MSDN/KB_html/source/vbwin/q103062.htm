The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for
<PRE>  Windows, versions 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can move controls at run time by using manual dragging with the Drag
method. Automatic dragging (DragMode = 1) does not work well for
repositioning controls at run time.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The key points to remember when using drag and drop to move controls at run
time are:

<UL><LI>In the MouseDown event, save the X and Y parameters. This position is
   relative to the upper left corner of the control to drag. Note that
   the MouseDown event only occurs when DragMode is set to Manual (0).

<LI>In the DragDrop event, move the control to the position of the mouse
   pointer adjusted by the position saved in MouseDown.
<P>
</UL><h3>Example Program</h3>
 
<P>
The following example program demonstrates how to reposition a picture box
at run time. Place the pieces of the program in the appropriate event
procedures.
<P>
Dim Save_X As Single
Dim Save_Y As Single
<P>
<PRE>' Enter the following Sub as one, single line:
Sub Picture1_MouseDown (Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, X As
   Single, Y As Single)
   Save_X = X       ' save mouse position (relative to this control)
   Save_Y = Y
   Picture1.Drag 1  ' begin dragging
End Sub

' Enter the following Sub as one, single line:
Sub Picture1_MouseUp (Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, X As
   Single, Y As Single)
   Picture1.Drag 2  ' end dragging, do DragDrop event
End Sub

Sub Form_DragDrop (Source As Control, X As Single, Y As Single)
   ' Move the control to the position of the mouse pointer.
   ' Adjust it by the distance the mouse pointer to the upper
   ' left corner of the control.
   Source.Move X - Save_X, Y - Save_Y
End Sub

Sub Picture1_DragDrop (Source As Control, X As Single, Y As Single)
   ' This handles the case when the control is dropped on itself
   ' as would happen if it was only moved a small amount.
   ' This is similar to Form_DragDrop except that the X and Y
   ' parameters are relative to this control, not the form.
   Source.Move Picture1.Left + X - Save_X, Picture1.Top + Y - Save_Y
End Sub
