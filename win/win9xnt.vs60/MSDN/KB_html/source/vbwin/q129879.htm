<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article demonstrates how to use the new capabilities of Visual Basic
Data Access Objects (DAO) 3.0 to manipulate relationships through Visual
Basic code. The step-by-step example uses DAO to read all relations from a
specified database and then attempts to append identical relations into the
current database. The appended relations that succeed become the imported
relations.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When attempts to append relations fail, it is often because either the
table names or fields names of that relation do not exist in the current
database. The appended relations that succeed will be the only relations
imported.
<P>
The following example shows how to use relation objects in the DAO. To run
this example, you must have access to a Microsoft Access database with
relations established on it. The NWIND.MDB database that ships with
Microsoft Access is used as an example. In this example, the function
imports the appropriate relations between the NWIND.MDB tables into a copy
of NWIND.MDB called NWIND2.MDB.
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Use the File Manager to make a new copy of the NWIND.MDB database in the
   \ACCESS\SAMPAPPS\ directory. Name the copy NWIND2.MDB and place it in
   the same directory.

<P><LI>Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add two command buttons (Command1 and Command2) to Form1.

<P><LI>Add the following code to the appropriate events:
<P>
<PRE>   Private Sub Command1_Click()
      '-------------------------------------------------------------------
      ' PURPOSE: Clear all relations from destination table.
      ' This is used to later demonstrate importing relations.
      '-------------------------------------------------------------------
      Dim ThisDb As Database
      Dim i As Integer

      Set ThisDb = DBEngine.Workspaces(0)_
         .OpenDatabase("C:\access\sampapps\nwind.mdb")

      ' Loop through all existing relations in that database:

      For i = ThisDb.Relations.Count - 1 To 0 Step -1
         Debug.Print i, ThisDb.Relations(i).Name
         ' Clear all relations to later demonstrate importing them:
         ThisDb.Relations.Delete ThisDb.Relations(i).Name
      Next
      Debug.Print "#Relations on "; ThisDb.Name; " = ";_
      ThisDB.Relations.Count
   End Sub

   Private Sub Command2_Click()
      Call ImportRelations("C:\access\sampapps\nwind2.mdb")
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub ImportRelations(DBName As String)
      '-------------------------------------------------------------------
      ' PURPOSE: Import relations where tablenames and fieldnames match.
      ' ACCEPTS: name of the database to import from as string.
      ' RETURNS: Number of relations imported as integer.
      '--------------------------------------------------------------------

      Cr$ = Chr$(13)
      RCount = 0

      Set ThisDb = DBEngine.Workspaces(0)_
         .OpenDatabase("C:\access\sampapps\nwind.mdb")

</PRE><P><LI>Start the program by choosing Start from the Run menu or by pressing the
