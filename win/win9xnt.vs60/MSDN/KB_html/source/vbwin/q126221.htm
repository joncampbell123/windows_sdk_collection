The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Visual Basic Control Development Kit (CDK) for
<PRE>  Microsoft Visual Basic Programming system for Windows, version 1.0
</PRE>- Microsoft Professional Toolkit for Microsoft Visual Basic,
<PRE>  version 1.0
</PRE>- Professional Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows,
<PRE>  versions 2.0 and 3.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A custom Event containing an underscore character (_) as part of the
Event's name will not fire, and it produces duplicate code in the Microsoft
Visual Basic Development Environment.
<P>
Also, if code is placed in the custom event that has an underscore in its
name, a duplicate of the event code will appear in the general section of
the IDE.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
If an underscore is present in an event's name, the return value from a
call to VBFireEvent will be Zero, but the custom event will not be
triggered in Visual Basic. This is because the underscore prevents Visual
Basic from finding the name of the event in the event list.
<P>
The reason for the duplicate code is that Visual Basic is unable to match
the code with the event for that control due to the underscore in the event
name.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Do not use the underscore character as part of the name of a custom event.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a VBX control that has an underscore character in its event name.

<P><LI>Load the VBX into a Visual Basic project.

<P><LI>Bring up a code window the form containing the control in question.

<P><LI>Choose [general] from the [Object:] drop down list.

<P><LI>Select the [Proc:] drop down list.

<P><LI>As you scroll the listbox, you will see duplicates of the functions and'
   code you thought were associated with the control event.
