<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you encounter a problem with a Visual Basic program and have to call
Microsoft Technical Support for assistance, your call time will be
minimized if you can provide a minimal program to reproduce the problem to
the support engineer. This article has some tips on how to reduce your
Visual Basic program to a minimum so you can accurately describe the
problem to a support engineer. The support engineer is looking for a way to
duplicate the problem using the least amount of objects and code.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following is the basic strategy of creating a minimal Visual Basic
program to isolate the problem so a support engineer can find a solution
quickly.

<OL><P><LI>Make a back up copy of your program.
</OL>2. Follow each step shown in the next section. After completing a step,
<PRE>   check to see if the problem still exists.
</PRE></OL>3. Copy the minimal program to a new project and check to see if the
<PRE>   problem still exists.

</PRE>Although there are several steps presented, you may not have to do all of
them to isolate your problem. However, you may need to modify your code to
get the program to compile properly to reproduce the problem.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reduce your Program to a Minimum</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Remove all forms, code modules, and class modules not used to re-create
   the problem.

<P><LI>Remove all VBX and OCX controls not used to re-create the problem.
   Visual Basic prevents any control used by the program from being
   removed.

<P><LI>Remove all unexecuted code from the remaining forms.

<P><LI>At this point you may be able to remove additional VBX and OCX controls
   that are not used by the remaining forms.

<P><LI>Remove pieces of code from the remaining procedures that do not appear
   to be related to the problem.
<P>
</OL>Repeat this process until you have the smallest possible program. Copy this
program to a new project. Try to remove pieces from the original project.
For example, if the problem is related to database access, use another
database to reproduce the problem, such as BIBLIO.MDB shipping with Visual
Basic.
<P>
An example of a minimal program used to reproduce a problem resulted when a
user called Microsoft Technical Support to troubleshoot an application
error that occurred when the program was closed. The minimum program
contained one form, one line of code, and no controls.
