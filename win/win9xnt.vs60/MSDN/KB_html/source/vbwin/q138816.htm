The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Standard, Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft
   Visual Basic, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After entering the path to the project file in Setup Wizard and selecting
next, you receive this error:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;An invalid pathname with two drive specifiers&gt; File not found.
   An error occurred while trying to build the project .exe or .dll

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error occurs when, before running the Setup Wizard, you choose to make
an .exe file in a directory one or more levels higher in the directory tree
than the directory where your project files are located.
<P>
For example, if your .vbp file is in C:\Myprogs\Prog1 and you choose to
make the .exe file in C:\, C:\Myprogs, or C:\Myprogs\Prog2, you may
encounter this problem.
<P>
The Setup Wizard always tries to recompile your project, but it fails while
making the attempt. The Setup Wizard will correctly handle the case where
the .exe is made in a subdirectory of the directory where the .vbp file is
located.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use either of the following two methods to resolve the problem:

<UL><LI>Before running the Setup Wizard, from within Visual Basic, make the .exe
   file in the directory containing the .vbp file -- or in a subdirectory.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Using a text editor like Notepad, modify the Path32 line in your .vbp
   file to point to your .exe file relative to the directory where your
   .vbp file is located. For example, if the .exe file is in C:\Temp and
   the project file is in C:\Vb, change the Path32 line so that it has an
   entry of ..\Temp. The problem with this solution is that the change is
   only temporary. The next time you save the project from Visual Basic
   4.0, Visual Basic will force this line to be absolute again, overwriting
   your change.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start a new project in Visual Basic.

<P><LI>Using the File Manager or Explorer, create a new temporary subdirectory
   on the root directory (for example, C:\Newtemp).

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Make EXE. Change the path for where the new .exe
   file will reside from the default of C:\Vb to the new temporary
   directory you just created. Click OK to make the new .exe file. It will
   reside in the temporary directory you created.

<P><LI>On the File menu, click Save Project, and save the default Form1.frm
   and Project1.vbp files in the C:\Vb directory.

<P><LI>Exit Visual Basic, and start the Setup Wizard.

<P><LI>When prompted for a path to the project file, give the Setup Wizard
   C:\Vb\Project1.vbp, and click Next. The Setup Wizard will minimize, and
   Visual Basic will start, but then Visual Basic will exit without
   compiling your project. At that point, the Setup Wizard will display the
   error saying that it couldn't find the file.
