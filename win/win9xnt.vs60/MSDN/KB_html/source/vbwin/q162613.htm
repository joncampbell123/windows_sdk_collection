<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Standard, Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual
   Basic, 32-bit only, for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
One of the new features of the Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 user interface
is the taskbar status area. This article demonstrates how to use Visual
Basic to add, modify, and delete status or notification indicators in the
taskbar status area.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The taskbar status area is located to the right of the Start button,
and provides you with status or notification indicators about your
programs. Icons with ToolTips are typically used as indicators in the
taskbar status area. The following are some examples of how to use the
taskbar status area:

<UL><LI>You can adjust the consumption level of your laptop's batteries by
   clicking a vertical graph in the taskbar status area and adjusting it
   in the window that appears. The graph indicates the amount of power
   left in your laptop computer's batteries.

<LI>You can track your favorite stock by creating an icon that changes
   when your stock changes price. Click the icon to display a chart of
   the stock.

<LI>You can adjust the volume control on a multimedia device by clicking
   the icon and displaying more controls.
<P>
</UL>To manipulate an icon in the taskbar status area, use the Windows API
function Shell_NotifyIcon in the Shell32.dll file. This function allows you
to add, modify, delete, set a ToolTip string, and send a callback message
to execute mouse events. Visual Basic does not directly accept callback
messages or functions. However, there are three ways to work around this
limitation:

<OL><P><LI>The Hard Way: Create a control that accepts callbacks. Refer to the
   Microsoft Systems Journal article cited in the References section of
   this article for a way to create a control that accepts callbacks. To
   create this control, you need Visual C++.

<P><LI>The Easy Way: Use a third-party control that intercepts messages, such
   as the Message Blaster control.

<P><LI>The Simple Way: Use a Visual Basic intrinsic control to serve as a
   Window that reacts to the callback message. This article contains a
   sample program that uses this method. With this method, you want to use
   an event in a control that is rarely used. The event will be exclusively
   used to process the callback message.
<P>
</OL>The next section explains the Shell_NotifyIcon function and the
requirements to use this function.
<P>
<P><h3>Shell_NotifyIcon Function</h3>
 
<P>
You use the Shell_NotifyIcon function to send a message to a system to add,
modify, or delete an icon from the taskbar status area. The function
returns True if the message is sent successfully or False if the function
is unsuccessful. The arguments of the functions are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   dwMessage: A message to execute an action. This parameter can be one of
   the following values:

      NIM_ADD: Adds an icon to the status area.
      NIM_DELETE: Deletes an icon from the status area.
      NIM_MODIFY: Modifies an icon in the status area.

   The values of these messages can be found in the header file,
   Shellapi.h.

   pnid: A pointer to a NOTIFYICONDATA structure. To pass this argument to
   the function, create a user-defined data type called NOTIFYICONDATA
   (shown later in this section) and pass this data type by value.

</PRE></OL>The NOTIFYICONDATA structure contains the following elements:
<P>
<PRE>   cbSize: Passes the size of the NOTIFYICONDATA data type.
      Data Type: Long.
      Value: Use the Len function with the variable declared as this data
      type as the argument.

   hWnd: Handle of the window used to receive the notification message.
      Data Type: Long.
      Value: The hWnd property of the control used to receive this message.

   uId: Identifier of the icon in the status area.
      Data Type: Long.
      Value: Any value within the limits of the Long data type. The sample
      program uses vbNull.

   uFlags: Array of flags that indicate which of the other members contain
   valid data.
      Data Type: Long.
      Value: Any combination of the following constants to indicate that
      the member of this structure is valid and will be used:

         NIF_ICON: Passing this flag indicates that the value for the
         hIcon will be the icon that appears in the taskbar status area.

         NIF_MESSAGE: Passing this flag indicates that the uCallBackMessage
         value will be used as the callback message.

         NIF_TIP: Passing this flag indicates that the value of szTip will
         be used as the ToolTip for the icon in the taskbar status area.

   uCallBackMessage: Identifier of the notification message sent to the
   window that is used to receive the messages.
      Data Type: Long.
      Value: The message used to identify that a mouse event has occurred
      within the rectangular boundaries of the icon in the taskbar status
      area.

   hIcon: Handle of the icon that is displayed in the taskbar status area.
      Data Type: Long.
      Value: The image that will be used as an icon in the taskbar status
      area. This can be the icon property of a control, an image from an
      image control, or any icon image.

   szTip: String to be used as the ToolTip text.
      Data Type: Fixed-length string 64 bytes long.
      Value: Any null-terminated string under 64 bytes.

</PRE>The next section explains how to use this function in a sample program to
manipulate icons in the taskbar status area.
<P>
<P><h3>The Sample Program</h3>
 
<P>
The sample program consists of a form containing two command buttons and
the common dialog box control. When you click Add Icon, you set the values
of the NOTIFYICONDATA data type. In this data type, you set the following
values:
<P>
<PRE>   cbSize: The length of the variable that uses the Len function.

   hWnd: The handle of the window used to receive the callback messages. In
   the sample program, the form is used as the window to receive the
   messages.

   uId: The icon identifier. Although you can use any number, the sample
   program uses the vbNull constants.

   uFlags: Array flags indicate what members of this structure are valid.
   The sample program uses all the flags for maximum versatility.

   uCallBackMessage: The message that is sent when mouse activity occurs on
   the icon in the taskbar status tray. The mouse message that is sent maps
   to a mouse event in the control specified in the hWnd value. You should
   use a mouse message that can handle the messages exclusively. For
   example, the sample program uses the WM_MOUSEMOVE message because this
   message maps to the MouseMove event of the form. Rarely used in its
   intended form, the MouseMove event is a suitable event for this purpose.

   hIcon: The icon that is to be displayed in the taskbar status area. The
   sample program uses the form icon.

   szTip: The ToolTip string. The string must be terminated with a null
   character so the vbNullChar constant is concatenated to the string.

</PRE>After setting the data, you then call the Shell_NotifyIcon function and
pass the NOTIFYICONDATA along with a message to add the icon to the taskbar
status area.
<P>
When you pass the mouse pointer over the icon in the taskbar status area,
the form receives the message WM_MOUSEMOVE. This message maps to the form's
MouseMove event. The X argument is the product of one of the mouse
constants that indicates the mouse input (such as a left-click,
right-click, single-click, or double-click) and the TwipsPerPixelX property
of the screen. The mouse input is produced by dividing the X argument with
this property. The mouse input is then used in a Select Case statement to
execute a series of instructions.
<P>
For example, when you double-click the icon, the common dialog box appears
and allows you to select a different icon. The hIcon value of the
NOTIFYICONDATA data type is changed to the new icon. The Shell_NotifyIcon
function is called with the new data type and a message to modify the icon
in the taskbar status area.
<P>
If you right-click the icon, you execute the InputBox function that changes
the ToolTip text. The new string is null terminated with the vbNullChar
constant and the szTip value is changed to the new string. The
Shell_NotifyIcon function is called with the new NOTIFYICONDATA data and a
message to modify the icon.
<P>
When you click Delete Icon or exit the application, the Shell_NotifyIcon
function is called with a message to delete the icon.
