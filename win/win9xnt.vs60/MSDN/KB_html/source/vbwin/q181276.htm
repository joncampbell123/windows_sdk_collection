</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
From Visual Basic 5.0, you cannot consistently produce extended ASCII
WingDings on DBCS (Double-Byte Character Set) versions of Windows 95 or
Windows NT 4.0. DBCS versions of Windows include Chinese, Japanese, and
Korean.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Extended ASCII WingDings are those the have ASCII values 128 through 255.
These WingDings cannot be displayed from the DBCS code pages because lead
byte ranges for the double byte character sets can start at 129. A lead
byte is the first half of the two byte representation used to describe
characters in the double byte character sets.
<P>
Character sets are sometimes called charsets. Charsets refer to the same
collections of characters defined by Windows code pages but their
identification numbers can be expressed in a single byte. A code page is
used to associate a numerical value to each character used in the language.
For example, to illustrate the relationship between code pages and
charsets, the code page for Chinese is 950 and the charset that corresponds
to this code page has a value of 136 (see CHINESEBIG5_CHARSET in step 3
below). By changing the charset using the CreateFontIndirect API, you can
display these WingDings using the TextOutA API.
<P>
There are other fonts whose extended ASCII characters can be displayed
using this method.
<P>
The sample below displays all WingDings from 32 to 255 on DBCS Windows 95
and NT 4.0. It uses the CreateFontIndirect and TextOutA APIs. The method
below can also be used to display extended ASCII characters for other
fonts. To change the font in this sample, set lf.lfFaceName to the name of
the font. It might also be necessary to modify lf.lfCharSet. Possible
values for lf.lfCharset are listed as constants in the code below.
