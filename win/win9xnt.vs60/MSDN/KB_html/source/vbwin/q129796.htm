<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Executing the Shell() function in a Visual Basic for Windows program starts
another executable program asynchronously and returns control to the Visual
Basic application. This shelled program continues to run independent of
your application until the user closes it.
<P>
However, if your Visual Basic application needs to wait for the shelled
process to terminate, you could use the Windows API to poll the status of
the application, but this is not a very efficient process. This article
shows by example how to use a better process.
<P>
There is a completely different process that would be used to accomplish
the same thing from a 16-bit application. For additional information on the
16-bit implementation, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
<P>

   TITLE     : HOWTO: Determine When a Shelled Process Has Terminated

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Win32 API has integrated functionality that enables your application to
wait until a shelled process has completed. To use these functions, you
need to have a handle to the shelled process. To accomplish this, you need
to use the CreateProcess() function to begin your shelled program instead
of the Shell() function.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating the Shelled Process</h3>
 
<P>
In a 32-bit application, you need to create an addressable process. To do
this, use the CreateProcess() function to start your shelled application.
The CreateProcess() function gives your program the process handle of the
shelled process via one of its passed parameters.
<P>
<P><h3>Waiting for the Shelled Process to Terminate</h3>
 
<P>
Having used CreateProcess() to get a process handle, you can pass that
handle to the WaitForSingleObject() function. This causes your Visual
Basic application to suspend execution until the shelled process
terminates.
<P>
Below are the steps necessary to build a Visual Basic for Windows program
that uses the CreateProcess() function to execute the Windows Notepad
(NOTEPAD.EXE) application. This code shows by example how to use the
Windows API CreateProcess() and WaitForSingleObject() functions to wait
until a shelled process terminates before resuming execution.
<P>
The syntax of the CreateProcess() function is extremely complicated, so in
the example code, it is encapsulated into a function called ExecCmd().
ExecCmd() takes one parameter, the command line of the application to
execute.
<P>

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following code the Form_Click() event procedure of Form1:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Form_Click ()
         ExecCmd "notepad.exe"
         MsgBox "Process Finished"

<P><LI>Using the mouse, click the Form1 window. At this point the Notepad
   application is shelled.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The MsgBox statement following the ExecCmd() subroutine is not
executed because the WaitForSingleObject() function prevents it. The
message box does not appear until Notepad is closed when the user chooses
Exit from Notepad's File menu (ALT, F, X).
