<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Compatibility setting allows you to determine the Visual Basic
project's compatibility to older versions of the ActiveX Components
generated from the project.
<P>
The ActiveX Components you create contain a default interface (for example,
CName_D where CName is the ClassName for the ActiveX Component) that
contains all of the methods and properties you have created. If your Class
raises events, you also have an additional interface called
IConnectionPointContainer. When you build an ActiveX Control or Server,
these Interfaces are given a unique identifier. If you modify your control
or server, these interfaces may change. Any applications using an older
version of your component may fail at this point. To ensure that your new
and old interfaces will work with all applications, you need to set the
appropriate Compatibility setting.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can set the Project's Compatibility in the Project\Properties dialog
box, under the Component tab.
<P>
Visual Basic 5.0 has three different compatibility settings for Projects:

<OL><P><LI>No compatibility

<P><LI>Project compatibility

<P><LI>Binary compatibility
<P>
</OL><h3>No Compatibility</h3>
 
<P>
With this setting, no compatibility is enforced. Visual Basic creates new
Interface IDs and Class IDs every time you build or compile your project.
Each version built can only be used with applications created to work with
that specific build of the component.
<P>
<P><h3>Project Compatibility</h3>
 
<P>
With this setting, you can make your project compatible to a specific
component project. While new type library information is generated, the
type library identifier is maintained so that test projects can still refer
to the component project. This setting is for maintaining compatibility
during testing. Therefore, once the component is released, it behaves the
same as the No Compatibility setting.
<P>
<P><h3>Binary Compatibility</h3>
 
<P>
When you compile your project, Visual Basic only creates new Class and
Interface IDs when necessary. It preserves the class and interface IDs
from the previous version(s) so that programs compiled using an earlier
version will continue to work. If you are making a change that will result
in an incompatible version, Visual Basic will warn you. If you want to
maintain compatibility with older, released versions of an ActiveX
component, this is the setting you need to use.
