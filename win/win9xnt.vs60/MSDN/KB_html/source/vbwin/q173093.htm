The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation, Learning, Professional, and
   Enterprise Editions for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When moving a Visual Basic 5.0 project from one folder to another, you may
see corruption to references that include a path longer than approximately
40 characters (such as DAO 3.5) in the project's .vbp file. On the same
drive, this problem can occur when one of the folders is at least one level
lower in the directory tree structure than the other. This problem does not
occur when saving the project to a different folder within the IDE.
<P>
This corruption may also occur when checking a VBP file out of Visual
Source Safe, if the file was previously saved and then checked in from a
different machine, even if the directory structure used to store the
project on the other machine is identical to that used on your machine.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Avoid moving .vbp files, or save them through the IDE to their new location
using File | Save As. Attempting to edit and correct the corrupt .vbp file
in Notepad does not work because the file becomes corrupt again the next
time it is saved.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this
bug and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Corruption of the .vbp file may occur when the project is moved to a
different directory.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create two new directories as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      C:\aaaTestThisBug
      C:\aaaFirstLevel\SecondLevel
</PRE><P>
   One of the directories needs to be two or more levels down.

<P><LI>Start a new Visual Basic Standard EXE project, Project1.

<P><LI>Go to Project | References and add at least one reference whose path
   is longer than approximately 40 characters (The reference to
   Microsoft DAO 3.5 Object Library is a good one).

<P><LI>Save Project1 to C:\aaaTestThisBug and exit Visual Basic. Using Windows
   Explorer, move the .vbp, .vbw, and .frm files associated with this
   project to C:\aaaFirstLevel\SecondLevel.

<P><LI>Open the .vbp file in Notepad and note that the all of the paths for
   the references are still correct.

<P><LI>Close Notepad.

<P><LI>Open Project1 with Visual Basic.

<P><LI>Save and Close Project1. Answer "yes" when prompted to save changes.

<P><LI>Examine the .vbp file in Notepad. Note that any reference that
   includes a path longer than approximately 40 characters is likely to
   be corrupted.
<P>
</OL><h3>Examples of sections from good and bad .vbp files</h3>
 
<P>
DAO 3.5 reference from a good file:
<P>
Reference=*\G{00025E01-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}#4.0#0#..\Program
Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\DAO\DAO350.DLL#Microsoft DAO 3.5 Object
Library
<P>
DAO 3.5 reference from a bad file:
<P>
Reference=*\G{00025E01-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}#4.0#0#..\..\..\Program
Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\DC:\Program Fi#Microsoft DAO 3.5 Object
Library
