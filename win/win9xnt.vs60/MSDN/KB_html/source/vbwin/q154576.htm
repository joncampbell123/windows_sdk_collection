<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Event logging in Windows provides a standard, centralized way for Windows
and any other applications to record important software and hardware
events. It also supplies a standard user interface for viewing the logs and
a programming interface for examining the logs.
<P>
Using the Win32 API Visual Basic, you can write events into the Event Log
and report important events from your own code into the System Log. Below
is a sample showing how to do this. The API functions must be used if an
application is written with Visual Basic 4.0.
<P>
NOTE: Visual Basic 5.0 has built-in functionality for event-logging so the
API functions are unnecessary.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Visual Basic 5.0</h3>
 
<P>
Visual Basic 5.0 exposes three methods and properties of the App object by
which event-logging can be enabled:
<P>
<PRE>    LogMode Property
    LogPath Property
    LogEvent Method

</PRE>The LogMode property returns a value that determines how logging (through
the LogEvent method) will be carried out. (Read-only at runtime).
<P>
The LogPath property returns the path and filename of the file used to
capture output from the LogEvent method. (Read-only at runtime).
<P>
The LogEvent method writes an event into the application's log target. On
Windows NT platforms, the method writes to the NT Event log. On Windows 95
platforms, the method writes to the file specified in the LogPath property;
by default, if no file is specified, events will be written to a file named
vbevents.
<P>
<P><h3>Visual Basic 4.0 (32-bit)</h3>
 
<P>
The following example shows how to send three different types of events.
These steps are for applications written with Visual Basic 4.0 only.
<P>

</PRE><P><LI>Press the F5 key to start the project.
<P>
</OL>You will need to start the NT Applet, EVENTVWR.EXE, to view the events
entered with the code. Because your events are coming from an Application,
you will need to select the "Application" option from the Log Menu and then
press the F5 key to refresh the view. Your events should be there under the
name of Project1.
