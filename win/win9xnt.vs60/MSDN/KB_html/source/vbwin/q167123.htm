The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation, Learning, Professional,
   and Enterprise Editions for Windows, version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Office Developer Edition 97
<LI>Microsoft Visual Studio 97
<LI>Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Your application may experience a crash if it was created using
COMCTL32.OCX version 5.00.3422 or 5.00.3601 and your system has been
upgraded to COMCTL32.OCX version 5.00.3714. Version 5.00.3601 shipped in
the Microsoft Office Developer's Edition 97 and version 5.00.3422 shipped
in Beta-1 of the Visual Basic Control Creation Edition.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Some changes in version 5.00.3714 caused the V-Table of COMCTL32.OCX to
change. With the V-Table changed, it is possible that an application will
call a method or property and crash because the function signature does not
match. Version 5.00.3714 ships with Visual Basic 5.0 Learning,
Professional, and Enterprise Editions.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem has been fixed in version 5.00.3828 of COMCTL32.OCX. This
version is binary-compatible with the 5.00.3422 version of
COMCTL32.OCX and the 5.00.3714 and 5.00.3601 versions of COMCTL32.OCX.
<P>
There is no need to re-build applications built with version 5.00.3422 and
5.00.3601; to get them running correctly, you simply need to install
version 5.00.3828. However, if you are going to re-deploy your application,
you may want to rebuild your setup program so that it distributes version
5.00.3828.
<P>
To obtain the latest version of COMCTL32.OCX Visual Basic 5.0, Visual C++
5.0, and Visual Studio 97, owners should install the Visual Studio 97
Service Pack 1.
<P>
For additional information about the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 1,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Visual Studio 97.

</PRE>Version 5.00.3828 of COMCTL32.OCX also shipped with the final release of
the Visual Basic 5.0 Control Creation Edition.
<P>
