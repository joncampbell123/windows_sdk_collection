The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Standard, Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft
   Visual Basic, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Visual Basic 4.0 installation procedure creates the file VB4SETUP.LST
based on the options the user selects. The VB4SETUP.LST file is used during
installation, and, at a later time, for adding and removing components.
Certain hardware and software problems and incompatibilities cause bad data
to be written to this file. The Visual Basic 4.0 setup program fails if it
cannot read the file, and displays the error message:
<P>
<PRE>   VB4SETUP.LST contains NULL characters

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is often caused by a faulty or incompatible CD-ROM driver,
drive, network, or network card. The data written to the temporary
VB4SETUP.STF file is corrupted. The EXTRACT.EXE utility, used to extract
the program files from the compressed *.CAB files, requires that all
components are 100 percent compatible and functioning properly.
<P>
Early ATAPI CD-ROM drivers, network and network component problems, and
some SCSI drivers and components are shown to cause this error.
<P>
In most cases, copying the contents of the root and \SETUP directories of
the Visual Basic 4.0 CD-ROM to a local hard drive and installing the
program from that drive solves the problem. However, obtaining the updated
components from the component vendor is recommended whenever possible.
<P>
You can obtain the latest CD-ROM or SCSI drivers from the CD-ROM drive or
SCSI controller vendor. If you are installing from a network, contact the
network administrator or vendor about possible network problems and
hardware or software updates.
