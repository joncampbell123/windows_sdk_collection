The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Professional Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows,
<PRE>  versions 2.0 and 3.0
</PRE>- Microsoft Professional Toolkit for Microsoft Visual Basic programming
<PRE>  system for Windows, version 1.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If the Height property of a graph made with the Graph custom control is set
to less than approximately 1.75 inches (depending on monitor size and type)
in versions 1.0 and 2.0 or less than approximately .75 inches in version
3.0, the text contained in the BottomTitle will disappear from the graph.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior occurs because the Graph custom control chooses the text font
automatically based on control size. When the smallest size text font is
exhausted, it blanks out the BottomTitle text.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic or from the File menu, choose New Project (ALT,
   F, N) if Visual Basic is already running. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Add File. In the Files box, select the
   GRAPH.VBX custom control file. The Graph tool appears in the
   toolbox.

<P><LI>Place a Graph control on Form1.

<P><LI>Size the Graph control to about 3 inches by 3 inches.

<P><LI>Change the Graph BottomTitle property to "This is a test." Notice
   that the title, "This is a test," is displayed at the bottom of
   the chart.

<P><LI>Notice that as you size the form to be shorter, the typeface scales
   down automatically. Eventually it will disappear off the graph.
   This occurs when the Height property is less than approximately
   1.75 inches (depending on monitor size and type), regardless of the
   form's ScaleMode setting.
