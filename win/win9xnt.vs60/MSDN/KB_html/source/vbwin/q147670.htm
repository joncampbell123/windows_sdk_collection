The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Standard, Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual
   Basic, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Setup Wizard can be used to easily generate setup programs for Visual
Basic applications. This article explains how to modify a data file that
the Setup Wizard uses so that the Setup Wizard will treat any custom or
third-party OCXs in the same manner it treats the controls that ship with
Visual Basic 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Setup Wizard utilizes a file called SWDEPEND.INI to determine what, if
any, additional action is necessary upon installation of each file. It is
also used to determine the dependent files that each included file may need
to run properly. The SWDEPEND.INI file is generated the first time the
Setup Wizard is run and is located in the Windows directory. All OCXs that
ship with Visual Basic have an entry in the SWDEPEND.INI file that
specifies what sort of registration should take place after the control is
installed and what, if any, additional files that should be installed with
the control. For example, the following entry exists for the 32-bit DBGrid
control:
<P>
<PRE>   [DBGRID32.OCX]
   Register=$(DLLSelfRegister)
   Dest=$(WinSysPath)
   Uses1=OCX Runtime Support
   Uses2=GRDKRN32.DLL
   Uses3=

</PRE>The Register line specifies that the file is auto-registering by means of
an exported DLLSelfRegister function. Setup Wizard will call this function
to register the control after the file has been copied. The Dest line
supplies the location that the file should be copied to, in this case to
the Windows system directory. All remaining UsesX lines list the additional
files that should be copied to the target system where the program is
installed.
<P>
To automatically enable the Setup Wizard to support a custom OCX, all that
is necessary is to add a section for the given OCX to the SWDEPEND.INI
file. Following the above example, this section would look something like:
<P>
<PRE>   [MYBIGOCX.OCX]
   Register=$(DLLSelfRegister)
   Dest=$(WinSysPath)
   Uses1=OCX Runtime Support
   Uses2=

</PRE>After this addition, the Setup Wizard should generate a setup program that
will automatically register the custom OCX after installation.
<P>
Note that the 'OCX Runtime Support' entry includes MFC40.DLL. It does not,
however, include either MFC30.DLL or OC30.DLL. If the OCX was built with
MFC 3.0, both of these files should be specified in UsesX lines in the
entry for the OCX.
