The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Standard, Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual
   Basic, version 4.0, for Windows
<LI>Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications version 1.0 (found in
   Microsoft Excel 5.0 and 7.0, and Microsoft Project 4.0 and 7.0)
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The MAPI DLLs that come with Microsoft Windows, Windows NT, and Windows 95
include a set of BMapi calls that were designed for use with Microsoft
Visual Basic versions 1.0 through 3.0. Due to changes in the way Visual
Basic for Applications (and Visual Basic 4.0) byte aligns its user-defined
types, these function calls no longer work. Any attempts to use these calls
results in a General Protection Fault (GPF) or a Bad DLL Calling Convention
error message. The workaround is to use Vbamapi.dll or Vbamap32.dll. These
helper DLLs perform the same actions as the old BMapi calls, but they are
designed to work with Visual Basic for Applications and Visual Basic 4.0.
Anyone who wants to make direct MAPI calls from Visual Basic will be
required to use these (or similar) helper DLLs.
