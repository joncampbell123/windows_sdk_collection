The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Professional Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows, version 2.0
- Microsoft Professional Toolkit for Microsoft Visual Basic programming
<PRE>  system for Windows, version 1.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When the 3-D Panel custom control is disabled by setting the Enabled
property to False(0), the controls on the 3-D Panel (if any) are
disabled but the caption displayed for the 3-D Panel control is not
dimmed.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the products listed above.
This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual Basic version 3.0 for
Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Like the standard Frame and Picture controls in Visual Basic, the 3-D
Panel can also be used to group other controls together. When these
containers or parent controls are disabled by setting the Enabled
property to False(0), the controls they contain, or the child controls,
are also disabled. In addition, the caption on the frame is dimmed.
However, the caption of the 3-D Panel custom control is not dimmed, even
though the child controls on it are disabled.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic, or choose New Project from the File menu (ALT F, N)
   if Visual Basic is already running. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Add File, and select the THREED.VBX
   custom control file. The 3-D Panel tool will appear in the Toolbox.

<P><LI>Place a panel control (Panel3D1) on the form.

<P><LI>Draw a command button (Command1) within the boundaries of the panel
   control. Make sure the caption of the panel control is still visible.

<P><LI>Draw another command button (Command2) on the form outside the panel
   control, and change its Caption property to Disable panel. This button
   will be used to disable/enable the panel, which will in turn
   disable/enable the Command1 button on the panel control.

<P><LI>Add the following code to the Command1_Click event procedure:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Command1_Click ()
      MsgBox "You clicked the button!"
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following code to the Command2_Click event procedure:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Command2_Click()
      Panel3D1.Enabled = Not Panel3D1.Enabled 'Enable/Disable panel
         If Panel3D1.Enabled Then
            Command2..Caption = "Disable panel"
         Else
            Command2.Caption = "Enable panel"
      End If
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Press the F5 key to run the program.
<P>
</OL>With the panel disabled, the Command1 button will produce the message box
when clicked. If you click the Command2 button, the Command1 button is
disabled as expected. The panel control is disabled but its caption is not
dimmed.
