<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Professional and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic,
   16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains sample code that illustrates how to call Windows
Clipboard API to copy a disk metafile to the Windows Clipboard using
the 16-bit and 32-bit versions of Visual Basic 4.0. The code in the article
can also be used to work around a bug in the SetData method of the Visual
Basic Clipboard object. The workaround replaces the SetData method you use
when you copy a disk metafile to clipboard.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following statement loads a metafile from a disk and copies it to the
Windows Clipboard:
<P>
<PRE>   'DiskMetaFileName is the path to a WMF file on the disk.
   Clipboard.SetData LoadPicture(DiskMetaFileName), vbCFMetafile

</PRE>The metafile is successfully copied to the Clipboard. However, the metafile
size in the y dimension suggested in the disk metafile is ignored, and is
set to match the suggested size in the x dimension. You can reproduce the
bug by using the following code fragment with an Image control (Image1) on
the form:
<P>
<PRE>   Clipboard.Clear                        ' Clear Clipboard.
   Clipboard.SetData LoadPicture(DiskMetaFileName), vbCFMetafile
   Image1.Stretch = False   'Resize the control to fit the graphics
   Image1.Picture = Clipboard.GetData(vbCFMetafile) 'Copy from Clipboard
   Debug.Print Image1.Width, Image1.Height

</PRE>NOTE: Image1.Width is always the same as Image1.Height.
<P>
The sample code in this article provides a subroutine, SetMetaToClp, that
works around the bug by directly calling Windows API.
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic 4.0. If it is already running, choose New Project
   from the File menu. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add two CommandButtons, Command1 and Command2, to Form1.

<P><LI>Add one Image control, Image1, to Form1.

<P><LI>Clear all the code for Form1, and then paste the following code to the
   code window of Form1:
<P>
<PRE>'Please change the path so that it points to a valid metafile.
</PRE></OL>Private Const strFileName = "d:\vb4\metafile\arrows\Smallarw.wmf"
<P>
<PRE>Private Sub Command1_Click()
    Clipboard.Clear                ' Clear Clipboard.
    Clipboard.SetData LoadPicture(strFileName), vbCFMetafile
    Image1.Stretch = False
    Image1.Picture = Clipboard.GetData(vbCFMetafile) 'Copy from Clipboard
    Debug.Print Image1.Width, Image1.Height
'Image1.Width is always the same as Image1.Height. Bug!
End Sub

Private Sub Command2_Click()
    Clipboard.Clear                       ' Clear Clipboard.
    SetMetaToClp strFileName
    Image1.Stretch = False
    Image1.Picture = Clipboard.GetData(vbCFMetafile) 'Copy from Clipboard
    Debug.Print Image1.Width, Image1.Height
'Image1.Width and Image1.Height now display the metafile size suggested
'in the disk metafile
End Sub

   code to Module1:
