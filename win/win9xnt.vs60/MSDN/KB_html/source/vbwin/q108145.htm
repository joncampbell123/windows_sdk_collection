<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The VISDATA.MAK file installed in the VB3\SAMPLES\VISDATA directory
loads extensive examples of data access. The VISDATA sample program uses
every data access function in Visual Basic. You can refer to the VISDATA
source code for examples of how to use each data access function.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following description of the VISDATA sample program is taken from
the VB3\SAMPLES\SAMPLES.TXT file:

<P><h2>6:  ODBC</h2>
 
<P>
Program example using ODBC and the VT (Virtual Table) object layer.
<P>
NOTE:  To access ODBC data sources with this sample you must
<PRE>       first install ODBC using the ODBC setup program provided
       with Visual Basic Professional Edition.

</PRE>BRIEF DESCRIPTION:
<P>
This sample program illustrates various programming techniques
used to access data through the VT layer built into Visual Basic
Professional. It behaves like a general purpose database utility
capable of the following functions:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Table Creation
   2. Table Modification (adding and deleting fields and indexes)
   3. Data Browsing/Modifying one record at a time using a
      dynaset or a table
   4. Data Browsing via the Grid control (non-updatable)
   5. Data Browsing/Modifying via the new Data Control
   6. Data Export to Tab Delimited text file
   7. Direct SQL statement execution for any SQL supported
      functions such  as Insert, Update, Delete, Drop, Create,
      and Dump
   8. AdHoc Query tool that helps users unfamiliar with SQL
      create complex queries with where clauses, joins, order
      by and group by expressions while limiting output to
      selected columns
   9. Transaction Processing
  10. Copying table structures and data to same or different
      server
  11. Support of Microsoft Access, dBASE 3, dBASE 4, FoxPro 2.0,
      Paradox 3.x, Btrieve, SQL and Oracle data, both DDL and DML

</PRE>The code contains comments to help explain the use of the various
methods in the data access layer. Code and forms may be copied from
this application to other applications with minimal modification.
<P>
ODBC BACKGROUND:
<P>
ODBC  (Open DataBase Connectivity) is a standard adopted by
multiple vendors designed to enable users to connect to any data
source with a single application. This is achieved through a
layered approach including:
<P>
<PRE>   1. Programming Layer -- embedded functions in the development
      tool, which in this case is Visual Basic Professional Edition.
   2. Driver Manager -- the basic ODBC library that routes calls
      to the appropriate driver.
   3. Data Driver -- the library of functions that acts upon a
      specific database backend such as SQL Server, Xbase,
      Excel, etc. (note that SQL Server is the first of many
      drivers to become available for ODBC)

</PRE>These layers work together to enable data access from any source
for which an ODBC driver exists. The sample application will work,
without modification, on any new, level-one ODBC driver that becomes
available. With multiple drivers, connections may be made to
different data sources from the same application at the same time
enabling seamless data access from disparate data sources.

</PRE>TO RUN:
<P>
After starting the Visual Basic environment (VB.EXE), you can
load files in this sample program by choosing Open Project from
the File menu and selecting the VISDATA.MAK file in the
SAMPLES\VISDATA directory.
<P>
If you want to open a local database, you need to choose
the type of database and a file open common dialog will be
provided with the file type set to the requested data file type.
<P>
If you choose ODBC from the File/Open menu, the next dialog you
will see is the Open DataBase form. Because you probably have no
servers entered, you will need to enter a name for an existing
SQL server on your network. If you already know the user ID and
password, you can add them as well. The Database name is optional.
Once you have entered this data, choose Okay. Now, you should be
able to log on to the server. You may get some more dialogs in
the process. Answer any questions you can and ask the SQL
administrator for help if you run into problems or don't know some
of the parameters.
<P>
Once a database is open, double-click a table name to open the table
in the selected mode (Single Record or Table View). Use the Query
Builder to create dynasets with selected data from one or more tables
at a time. If you choose Use Data Control or Use Grid, a dynaset
will be created. However, the following objects will be created under
the following circumstances when you choose No Data Control:
<P>
<PRE>Data Type       Feature Chosen    Object Type Created
</PRE> 
<PRE>MS Access       Table Open        Table
MS Access       Query Open        Dynaset
MS Access       Execute SQL       Dynaset
ISAM            Table Open        Table
ISAM            Execute SQL       Dynaset
ODBC            Any               Dynaset

</PRE>The table is always updatable and the dynaset will be updatable in
most cases except on ODBC with no unique index, certain multiple
table joins, and other SQL select statements such as count(*) or
max().
