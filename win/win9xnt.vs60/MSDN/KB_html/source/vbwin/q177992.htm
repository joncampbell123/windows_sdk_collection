<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article demonstrates how to intercept input from the keyboard before
it reaches your Visual Basic application. Most keyboard input can be
readily intercepted by a Visual Basic application by using the KeyDown
event of the form or control. The technique shown here allows you how to
handle otherwise unavailable key combinations such as the TAB key or access
key combinations.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can create a keyboard hook that intercepts all keyboard input directed
to a given thread. To create this hook, you must replace the default
KeyboardProc() function with a KeyboardProc() of your own. The AddressOf()
construct introduced in Visual Basic 5.0 makes this possible. Within your
KeyboardProc(), you must either pass along the keyboard input you receive
or delete it. You cannot change the contents of the message you receive.
<P>
Why would you want to do this? One purpose of the keyboard hook could be to
enforce data validation before the current control loses focus. Another
purpose is to work around the difference in event sequence when using an
access (or hot key) as opposed to a TAB character or mouse click.
For additional information on this problem, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : PRB: Access Key Causes Different Event Order than Mouse
               Click

</PRE>The next section illustrates how to create a sample application that works
around this behavior by intercepting the access key, setting the focus, and
then causing a mouse-click event to occur. Please note that this does not
resolve all issues with the key order problems. For example, calling
Message boxes from an event affects the event order as well.
<P>
WARNING: Failure to unhook the keyboard hook before exiting your
application will result in errors, Invalid Page Faults, and data loss. This
is caused by the system pointing to the your KeyboardProc() function, which
no longer exists because it has not been notified of the change. Always
unhook the keyboard upon exiting the application. This is especially
important while debugging a program that uses this technique within the
Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0 Development Environment. Clicking the End button
or selecting End from the Run menu without unhooking will cause an Invalid
Page Fault and close Microsoft Visual Basic without giving you a chance to
save your code.

Steps to Create Sample Project
 

<OL><P><LI>Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

<P><LI>Add a TextBox and a CommandButton to Form1. Set the TabIndex of the
   TextBox to 0.

<P><LI>Add a module to the project. From the Project menu, click Add Module.

<P><LI>Copy the following code to the Code window of Module1:

         KeyboardProc = CallNextHookEx(hHook, nCode, wParam, lParam)
      End Function

</PRE><P><LI>Copy the following code to the Code window of the Form1 form:

         Debug.Print "Text1_LostFocus"
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Press the F5 key to run the program.
<P>
   The text box should have the focus. Click the CommandButton and note
   the sequence of events that occur as show in the debug window:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Text1_LostFocus
      Command1_GotFocus
      Command1_Click
</PRE><P>
   Set the focus to the text box and press the ALT+C keys and note that the
   same events occur.
<P>
</OL><h3>Notes</h3>
 
<P>
Hooks do not always behave the same way in the IDE as they do in an EXE.
Make certain that you test your solution in an EXE before you move on to
other parts of your project.
<P>
It is possible to intercept all of the keyboard input on a system, but not
using "pure" Visual Basic. The hook must be placed in a standard DLL; while
Visual Basic 5.0 can create OLE DLLs, it cannot create standard DLLs.
