The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation, Learning, Professional,
   and Enterprise Editions for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When compiling, running, or showing a form with too many controls on it,
the IDE may crash with an error similar to one of the following on
Windows 95:
<P>
<PRE>   "This program has caused an illegal operation and will be shut down. If
   the problem persists, contact the program vendor. VB5 caused an invalid
   page fault in module VB5.EXE"

   -or-

   "This program has caused an illegal operation and will be shut down. If
   the problem persists, contact the program vendor. VB5 caused an invalid
   page fault in module VBA5.DLL"

</PRE>Under Windows NT 4.0, an error similar to one of the following may be
encountered:
<P>
<PRE>   "Application Error: The instruction at "0x00417DAA" referenced memory at
   "0x021E41FA". The memory could not be "read". Unhandled exception in
   VB5.EXE 0xC0000005: Access Violation"

   -or-

   "Application Error: The instruction at "0x0FAD85F8" referenced memory at
   "0x01EE0112". The memory could not be "read." Unhandled exception in
   VBA5.DLL 0xC0000005: Access Violation"

</PRE>The memory addresses above are just examples. The addresses encountered may
vary.
<P>
It is also possible for this bug to simply cause the error:
<P>
<PRE>   “Error encountered during load”

</PRE>when opening a project that contains Forms with too many controls. This
will be most likely encountered when converting a Visual Basic 4.0
application.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When a project with a form containing too many controls is loaded into
Visual Basic 5.0, you may encounter incorrect name space mapping of
controls. This includes controls that are elements of control arrays. The
incorrect mappings may lead to the above-noted problems in the IDE.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this bug, follow the steps below:

<OL><P><LI>Remove any forms that have too many controls from the project.

<P><LI>With the project loaded, re-add the forms to the project using the
   "Project\Add File" menu. When you re-add the file in this way, Visual
   Basic correctly handles the naming of the controls.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: The forms will have to be added individually every time the project
is loaded. Trying to load the entire project will result in error.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio
97 Service Pack 2.
