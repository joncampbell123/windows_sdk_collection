The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Standard, Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft
   Visual Basic, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If the SSTab control is used to host OCXs, then the OCX controls remain in
the tab order regardless of whether their host tab is the current tab. When
the user tabs to these controls, it appears that no control has the focus.
This behavior does not occur with intrinsic controls.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Disable the TabStop property of all controls hosted by the SSTab control
that do not appear on the current tab. See the More Information Section
below for steps to work around the problem.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The SSTab control maps hosted controls off the left edge of the form, when
they are not on the current tab, and maps them back onto the form when
necessary. You can use this behavior to help determine whether a control is
able to obtain the focus. If the control's Left property is negative, then
the control should not be able to get the focus.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce and Work Around Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start a project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add a SSTab control to Form1. If the SSTab control does not appear in
   the toolbox, perform the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - From the Tools menu, choose Custom Controls and check the "Sheridan
      Tabbed Dialog Control" component. If the component is not listed,
      click the browse button and locate TABCTL16.OCX or TABCTL32.OCX.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add a MaskEdBox control to Tab1 of SSTab1. If the MaskEdBox control
   does not appear in the toolbox, perform the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - From the Tools menu, choose Custom Controls and check the "Microsoft
      Masked Edit control" component. If the component is not listed, click
      the browse button and locate MSMASK16.OCX or MSMASK32.OCX.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Choose Start from the Run menu, or press the F5 key to start.

<P><LI>Press the TAB key to tab onto the hidden MaskedEdBox control and note
   that the focus rectangle disappears. Now, enter some characters and
   click on Tab1. You will see that the MaskEdBox control contains the
   characters you typed.
<P>
</OL>To work around the problem, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Choose End from the Run menu, or click the Stop button on the toolbar
   to stop the program.

<P><LI>Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1:
<P>
<PRE>   Private Sub Form_Load()
     SSTab1_Click 0
   End Sub

   Private Sub SSTab1_Click(PreviousTab As Integer)
     Dim c As Control
     For Each c In Controls
       If TypeOf c.Container Is SSTab Then
         'Not all controls have the TabStop property
         On Error Resume Next
         c.TabStop = c.Left &gt; 0
         On Error GoTo 0
       End If
     Next
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Choose Start from the Run menu, or press the F5 key to start.
<P>
</OL>All the controls that are not displayed in the SSTab controls current tab
will now have their TabStop property set to FALSE, making them unable to
receive the focus using the Tab key.
<P>
Note that the above workaround assumes that the controls are children of
the SSTab control and not the children of container controls contained by
the SSTab (such as PictureBoxes).
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
