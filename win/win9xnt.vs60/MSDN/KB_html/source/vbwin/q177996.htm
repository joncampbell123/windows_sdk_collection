The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Learning, Professional, and Enterprise Editions
   for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If an event is raised from a UserControl while a modal form is active, the
event is not executed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The event is not executed if the UserControl is compiled into an OCX and
referenced from a project that is run in the IDE.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two workarounds to this problem:
<P>
- Use the compiled ActiveX component (OCX) only with compiled client
<PRE>  programs (EXE). In other words, both Visual Basic projects are compiled.

  -or-

</PRE>- Use both the ActiveX component and the client project in the IDE in a
<PRE>  project group. In other words, both Visual Basic projects are in design
  mode.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following section shows you how to create a sample project that
demonstrates this problem. To reproduce this behavior, you first need to
create a compiled ActiveX control with a custom event. Then you make a
reference to this control from another project and run that project in the
IDE.
<P>
<P><h3>Create the ActiveX Control</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start a new ActiveX control project in Visual Basic. UserControl1 is
   created by default.

<P><LI>Add a new form to the project. Add a CommandButton to Form1.

<P><LI>Copy the following code to the Code window of UserControl1:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Option Explicit
      Public WithEvents MyCommand As CommandButton
      Event TestEvent()
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Private Sub Command1_Click()
<PRE></PRE>         Set MyCommand = Form1.Command1
         Form1.Show vbModal
      End Sub

      Private Sub MyCommand_Click()
         RaiseEvent TestEvent
      End Sub

      Private Sub UserControl_Click()
         Set MyCommand = Form1.Command1
         Form1.Caption = "UserControl Form"
         Form1.Show vbModal
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Compile UserControl1 into an OCX file. Close all open windows associated
   with UserControl1.
<P>
</OL><h3>Create the Sample Project</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

<P><LI>Make a reference to the ActiveX control you created in the previous
   section by completing the following steps:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - From the Project menu, click Components. The Components dialog box
      is displayed.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Click Browse to open a dialog box that allows you to select the
      ActiveX component created in the previous section.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - Click OK to close the dialog boxes.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add the ActiveX control to the Form1 form. Adjust the ActiveX control
   size to take up most of the form.

<P><LI>Copy the following code to the Code window of Form1:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Option Explicit
      Private Sub UserControl11_TestEvent()
<PRE></PRE>         MsgBox "In the User control test event"
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Press the F5 key to run the project and click on Form1. The UserControl
   Form appears. Click Command1 and note that the message box indicating
   the custom event has executed does not appear.

<P><LI>Make the project into an EXE and run the EXE. Click Form1. The
<P><PRE>    UserControl Form appears. Click Command1 and note that the message box
    indicating the custom event has executed does appear.
