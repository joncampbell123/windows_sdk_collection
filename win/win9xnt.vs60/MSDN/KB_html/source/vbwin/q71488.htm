<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Creating rubber bands within Visual Basic can be done using the
DrawMode property. Rubber bands are lines that stretch as you move the
mouse cursor from a specified point to a new location. This can be
very useful in graphics programs and when defining sections of the
screen for clipping routines.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The theory of drawing a rubber-band box is as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Draw a line from the initial point to the location of the mouse
   cursor using:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [form].DrawMode = 6. {INVERT}
</PRE>
<P><LI>Move the mouse cursor.

<P><LI>Save the DrawMode.

<P><LI>Set the [form].DrawMode to 6. {INVERT}

<P><LI>Draw the same line that was drawn in step 1. This will restore the
   image underneath the line.

<P><LI>Set the [form].DrawMode back to the initial DrawMode saved in step 3.

<P><LI>Repeat the cycle again.
<P>
</OL>DrawMode equal to INVERT allows the line to be created using the
inverse of the background color. This allows the line to be always
displayed on all colors.
<P>
The sample below will demonstrate the rubber-band line and the
rubber-band box. Clicking the command buttons will allow the user
to select between rubber-band line or a rubber-band box. The user will
also be able to select a solid line or a dashed line.
<P>
Create and set the following controls and properties:
<P>
<PRE>   Control Name   Caption      Picture
   ------------------------------------------------
   Form1          Form1        c:\windows\chess.bmp
   Command1       RubberBand
   Command2       RubberBox
   Command3       Dotted
   Command4       Solid

</PRE></OL>In the general section of your code, define the following constants:
<P>
<PRE>Const INVERSE = 6       '*Characteristic of DrawMode property(XOR).
Const SOLID = 0         '*Characteristic of DrawStyle property.
Const DOT = 2           '*Characteristic of DrawStyle property.
</PRE>Const TRUE = -1
Const FALSE = 0
Dim DrawBox As Integer  '*Boolean-whether drawing Box or Line
Dim OldX, OldY, StartX, StartY As Single  '* Mouse locations
<P>
In the appropriate procedures, add the following code:
<P>
<PRE>Sub Form_MouseDown (Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, X As
                                       Single, Y As Single)
   '* Store the initial start of the line to draw.
   StartX = X
   StartY = Y

   '* Make the last location equal the starting location
   OldX = StartX
   OldY = StartY
End Sub

Sub Form_MouseMove (Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, X As
                      Single, Y As Single)
   '* If the button is depressed then...
   If Button Then
      '* Erase the previous line.
      Call DrawLine(StartX, StartY, OldX, OldY)

      '* Draw the new line.
      Call DrawLine(StartX, StartY, X, Y)

      '* Save the coordinates for the next call.
      OldX = X
      OldY = Y
   End If
End Sub

Sub DrawLine (X1, Y1, X2, Y2 As Single)
   '* Save the current mode so that you can reset it on
   '* exit from this sub routine. Not needed in the sample
   '* but would need it if you are not sure what the
   '* DrawMode was on entry to this procedure.
   SavedMode% = DrawMode

   '* Set to XOR
   DrawMode = INVERSE

   '*Draw a box or line
   If DrawBox Then
      Line (X1, Y1)-(X2, Y2), , B
   Else
      Line (X1, Y1)-(X2, Y2)
   End If

   '* Reset the DrawMode
   DrawMode = SavedMode%
End Sub

Sub Form_MouseUp (Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, X As Single,
                  Y As Single)
   '* Stop drawing lines/boxes.
   StartEvent = FALSE
End Sub

Sub Command2_Click ()
   '* Boolean value to determine whether to draw a line or box.
   DrawBox = TRUE
End Sub

Sub Command1_Click ()
   '* Boolean value to determine whether to draw a line or box.
   DrawBox = FALSE
End Sub

Sub Command3_Click ()
   '* Create a dotted line
   Form1.DrawStyle = DOT
End Sub

Sub Command4_Click ()
   '* Create a solid line.
   Form1.DrawStyle = SOLID
End Sub
