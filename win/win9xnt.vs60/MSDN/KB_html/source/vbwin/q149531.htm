The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Professional and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic,
   16-bit only, for Windows version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you have any .OCX, .VBX, or .DLL that was created by the Control
Developer's Kit (CDK) loaded in memory when you exit Windows 3.1, Windows
will hang trying to call the WEP in the .OCX.
<P>
Visual Basic 3.0 or 4.0 (16-bit) application contains a control created by
the CDK (for example, CIRC3). When the application is still running, and
you exit Windows 3.1, the system hangs.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The cause of this hanging is that the CDK-provided WEP calls into other
.DLLs. During Windows shutdown, those .DLLs may have already been unloaded.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the 16-bit version of the
Control Development Kit.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The solution is for the control to implement a custom WEP and only call the
CDK's WEP when Windows isn't shutting down. In the case where Windows is
shutting down, the control's custom WEP shouldn't do anything.
<P>
The following code may be used as a control's custom WEP procedure. Place
these statements in the main .CPP file of the control. For example,
CIRC3.CPP.
<P>
<PRE>   extern "C" int CALLBACK WEP(int);

   extern "C" int CALLBACK CTLWEP(int nExitType)
   {
      if (nExitType == WEP_SYSTEM_EXIT)
         return 0;

      return WEP(nExitType);
   }

</PRE>In the 16-bit .DEF file (for example, CIRC3.DEF), change the following line
<P>
<PRE>   WEP                 @1  RESIDENTNAME

to:

   WEP=CTLWEP          @1  RESIDENTNAME

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This is a problem with how the CDK has implemented their WEP. For end
users, this will happen if they try to exit Windows with an application
that has a CDK .OCX, .VBX, or .DLL loaded.
