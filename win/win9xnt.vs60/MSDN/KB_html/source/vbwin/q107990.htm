<P><h2>1:  MAPI Sample</h2>
 
<P>
Program example using the MSMAPI.VBX controls, MapiMessages and
MapiSession controls.
<P>
NOTE:  To run this sample, you need a MAPI-compliant messaging
<PRE>       system such as the one contained in Microsoft Windows for
       Workgroups.

</PRE>BRIEF DESCRIPTION:
This sample program illustrates the use of the MAPI controls by
sending and receiving electronic mail.
<P>
BACKGROUND:
The MapiSession control establishes a MAPI session and signs off
from a MAPI session. The MapiMessages control allows you to
perform a variety of messaging systems functions after a messaging
session has been established. These functions include accessing,
downloading, and sending messages, displaying the details and
address book dialog boxes, accessing data attachments, resolving
recipient names during addressing, and performing compose, reply,
reply-all, forward, and deleting actions on messages.
<P>
FILES:
<PRE>   MAILLST.FRM.......Form for displaying the list of mail messages.
   MAILLST.FRX.......The binary portion of the mail messages form.
   MAILOPTF.FRM......Form for setting options.
   MAILSUP.BAS.......Module of support routines for the example.
   MSGVIEW.FRM.......Form in which a viewed message is displayed.
   MSGVIEW.FRX.......The binary portion of the viewed messages form.
   NEWMSG.FRM........Form for creating a new message.
   VBMAIL.FRM........The main form.
   VBMAIL.FRX........The binary portion of the main form.
   VBMAIL.MAK........The MAKE file for the project.

</PRE>TO RUN:
After starting the Visual Basic environment (VB.EXE), you can load
files in this sample program by choosing Open Project from the File
menu and selecting the VBMAIL.MAK file.
<P>
 
<P><h2>2:  Multimedia Sample</h2>
 
<P>
This sample program illustrates the use of some of the device types
supported by the Media Control Interface (MCI). The four device
types used in this program are:
<P>
<PRE>Device Type     Description
</PRE> 
<PRE>MMMovie         Plays Multimedia movie files (*.MMM).
CDAudio         Plays audio discs from the CD-ROM drive.
Sequencer       Plays MIDI sequencer sound files (*.MID).
WaveAudio       Plays digitized waveform sound files (*.WAV).

</PRE>HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
In order to access a CD-ROM drive or a sound card, the hardware,
along with any supporting device drivers, should be installed
and configured for the machine. The following table lists
the hardware required for the MCI device types used in this
program:
<P>
<PRE>Device Type     Hardware
</PRE> 
<PRE>MMMovie         No extra hardware. *See software requirements.
CDAudio         CD-ROM drive.
Sequencer       Sound card (e.g., Sound Blaster Pro)
WaveAudio       Sound card.

</PRE>SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:
In order to run the MCI application, Microsoft Windows with
Multimedia Extensions 1.0, or Windows with Multimedia must be
installed. The Multimedia Extensions include device drivers for
the different types of MCI devices.
<P>
To access a specific MCI device type, the corresponding MCI device
driver must be installed. The following table lists the device
drivers required for the MCI device types used in this program:
<P>
<PRE>Device Type     Device Driver
</PRE> 
<PRE>MMMovie         MCIMMP.DRV    *See note below.
CDAudio         MCICDA.DRV
Sequencer       MCISEQ.DRV
WaveAudio       MCIWAVE.DRV

</PRE>The [mci] section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains a list of the
installed MCI device types. This is what your file would look
like if all 4 of the above device types were installed:
<P>
[mci]
CDAudio=mcicda.drv
WaveAudio=mciwave.drv
Sequencer=mciseq.drv
MMMovie=mcimmp.drv
<P>
BACKGROUND:
The MCI control provides a high-level interface for using
multimedia devices. Using the property settings of a control, you
can determine the settings and the actions of a device.
<P>
The MCI control is also smart enough to know what actions are
relevant for the current state of a device. For example, if you
click a "Pause" button while playing a movie, the "Play" button
is automatically re-enabled.
<P>
MMMovie NOTE:
If you are unable to run an animation movie (*.MMM file), make
sure the MCIMMP.DRV and MMP.DLL files are installed on your
machine. To install the animation driver from Windows 3.1, run
the "Drivers" applet from the Control Panel, insert Disk 1 of the
Professional Edition. Select "Unlisted Driver," and accept "A:\"
as the directory. You will then be ready to use the animation
features of the MCI control.

methods in the data access layer. Code and forms may be copied from
this application to other applications with minimal modification.
<P>
ODBC BACKGROUND:
ODBC  (Open Database Connectivity) is a standard adopted by
multiple vendors designed to enable users to connect to any data
source with a single application. This is achieved through a
layered approach including:

<OL><P><LI>Programming Layer-embedded functions in the development
    tool which in this case is Visual Basic Professional.
 2. Driver Manager-the basic ODBC library that routes calls
    to the appropriate driver.
 3. Data Driver - the library of functions that acts upon a
    specific database backend such as SQL Server, Xbase,
    Excel, etc. (note that SQL Server is the first of many
    drivers to become available for ODBC)
<P>
</OL>These layers work together to enable data access from any source
for which an ODBC driver exists. The sample application will work,
without modification, on any new level one ODBC driver that becomes
available. With multiple drivers, connections may be made to
different data sources from the same application at the same time
enabling seamless data access from disparate data sources.
<P>
FILES:
<PRE>   ABOUTBOX.FRM......Standard "About box" for the application.
   ABOUTBOX.FRX......Icon for the "About Box".

</PRE></OL>TO RUN:
After starting the Visual Basic environment (VB.EXE), you can
load files in this sample program by choosing Open Project from
the File menu and selecting the VISDATA.MAK file in the
SAMPLES\VISDATA directory.
<P>
To open a local database, choose the type of database and a file
open common dialog will be provided with the file type set to the
requested data file type.
<P>
If you choose ODBC from the File/Open menu, the next dialog you
will see is the Open Database form. Because you probably have no
servers entered, you will need to enter a name for an existing
SQL server on your network. If you already know the user ID and
password, you can add them as well. The Database name is optional.
Once you have entered this data, select 'Okay' and you should be
able to log on to the server. You may get some more dialogs in
the process. Answer any questions you can and ask the SQL
administrator for help if you run into problems or don't know some
of the parameters.
<P>
Once a database is open, double-click a table name to open the table
in the selected mode (Single Record or Table View). Use the Query
Builder to create dynasets with selected data from one or more tables
at a time. If "Use Data Control" or "Use Grid" is chosen, a dynaset
will be created. However, the following objects will be created only
under the following circumstances when the "No Data Control" option is
selected:
<P>
<PRE>Data Type            Feature Chosen    Object Type Created
</PRE>

ODBC                 Any               Dynaset

</PRE>The table is always updatable and the dynaset will be updatable in
most cases except on ODBC with no unique index, certain multiple
table joins, and other SQL select statements such as count(*),
max(), and so on.
<P>
