<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you run the MCITEST sample program included with the Microsoft
Visual Basic Professional Edition programming system version 2.0
for Windows; or the Professional Toolkit for Microsoft Visual Basic
programming system version 1.0 for Windows, and receive the following
error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The device is not open or is not known

</PRE>it is possible that you have not installed the multimedia movie player
driver that is on Disk 1 of the Professional Edition, or Professional
Toolkit. These drivers are not automatically installed because of their
large sizes. If you need these files, you must install them using the
Windows Control Panel.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The drivers needed to run the animation portion of the MCITEST are
MCIMMP.DRV and MMP.DLL. These files are archived on Disk 1 of the
Visual Basic for Windows Professional Edition or Professional Toolkit. To
install these drivers, you must use the Windows 3.1 Control Panel. If you
have Multimedia Extensions for Windows 3.0, you must rename the following
files on Disk 1 before installing using the Control Panel:
<P>
<PRE>   MCIMMP.DR_  to    MCIMMP.DRV
   MMP.DL_     to    MMP.DLL

</PRE>To install the drivers, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Run Control Panel from the Windows Program Manager either by clicking
   on the icon or by choosing Run from the File menu.

<P><LI>In the Control Panel, double-click the Drivers icon.

<P><LI>In the Drivers dialog box, choose the Add button.

<P><LI>In the Add dialog box, select Unlisted or Updated Driver and choose
   the OK button.

<P><LI>In the Install Driver dialog box, specify the drive containing Disk
   1 of the Visual Basic for Windows Professional Edition or Professional
   Toolkit, and choose the OK button.

<P><LI>In the Add Unlisted or Updated Driver dialog box, select the
   "[MCI] Multimedia Movie Player" driver and choose the OK button.
<P>
</OL>The driver is now installed. You should now be able to run the
animation portion of the MCITEST program.
