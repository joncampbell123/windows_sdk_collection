<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Visual Basic programming system for Windows, version 3.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Performing an Edit Replace All on a long line of code in the Visual Basic
Environment may generate this error message:
<P>
<PRE>   One or more replacements too long and not made.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Visual Basic for Windows environment limits the length of individual
lines of code to 1023 characters. No line longer than this may be input.
However, if you choose Edit Replace from the Visual Basic menu with the
Replace All button selected, the environment erroneously limits the total
line length to 254 characters.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To create a line longer than 254 characters, do it in separate lines and
then concatenate the lines together by deleting the carriage return between
the lines. A better solution would be to break up the single long line
into multiple shorter lines. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../vbwin/q94696.htm">Q94696</A></B>
<PRE>TITLE     : How to Break Long Statements into Multiple Lines

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem has been corrected in Visual Basic
version 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add the following code to the Form_Load event:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Form_Load ()
      Dim S As String
      ' Enter the following four lines as one, single line:
      S = "This is a test.This is a test.This is a test.This is a test.
      This is a test.This is a test.This is a test.This is a test.
      This is a test.This is a test.This is a test.This is a test.
      This is a test.This is a test.This is a test.This is a test.This xx"
      ' The previous string's quoted text is 247 characters in length.
      ' The total line length is 254 characters.
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Choose replace-all from the edit menu, and choose to change 'xx' to
<PRE>   'xxx' to generate the following error message:

      One or more replacements too long and not made.

   The help text on this error message indicates that the replace
   operation has reached a 1023 character maximum:

   "A replace operation has attempted to create a line of code longer
   than the 1023-character maximum allowed. Those replacements where the
   resulting line is less than 1023 characters were completed."

   This is not true. The line length has not exceeded 1023 characters.
