- Professional Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows, version 3.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you want to use ODBC API functions instead of VBSQL data object
variables for data access in Visual Basic, consider the following issues:

<UL><LI>On average, the data access speed of the VBSQL API functions versus ODBC
   API functions is about equal. ODBC does some calls slightly faster, and
   VBSQL (DBLIB) does some other calls faster.

<LI>The VBSQL API may be slightly easier to use than the ODBC API, but is
   not as generic as the ODBC API.

<LI>If portability to C is important to you, the API calls for VBSQL are
   identical to the C calls -- except with C you need to bind each variable
   with each column, which can be tedious. The error handlers with VBSQL
   resemble the C language in that VBSQL implements real call-back
   handlers, but this is not an option with the ODBC API.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The VBSQL.VBX custom control file comes from the Microsoft SQL Server
Programmer's Toolkit for Visual Basic.
<P>
The following guide offers further information on VBSQL:

<PRE>   "Hitchhiker's Guide to VBSQL: The developer's roadmap to the Visual
   Basic Library for SQL Server," by Bill Vaughn.

   ISBN # 0-9640242-0-9
   Available in London, England, at "The PC Bookshop Ltd."

   In the rest of the world, purchase the book by sending $45 in U.S. funds

   accepted.

   The Third Edition covers accessing the SQL Server (Microsoft and Sybase)
   through VBSQL (DBLIB) and data access object variables in Visual Basic
   version 3.0. This is a definitive work on accessing the SQL Server from
   Visual Basic.

</PRE><h3>Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)</h3>
 
<P>
The greatest impact of Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is on
organizations where information is stored on a variety of dissimilar
computers and databases. Under the ODBC scheme, a driver written for a
specific database program, such as ORACLE, Ingres, or IBMs DB2, acts as the
intermediary between the application and the database.
<P>
By using ODBC calls and the appropriate driver(s), the same application,
be it a spreadsheet or an accounting package, can easily extract and
manipulate information stored in a variety of databases.
<P>
ODBC-compliant applications include Microsoft Excel version 5.0 and Word
version 6.0.
