The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Professional and Enterprise Editions for Windows,
   version 5.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit and 32-bit, for
   Windows, version 4.0

   Windows, version 3.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Visual Basic does not have any built-in functions that tell if a file
exists or not. This article demonstrates how to find out if a file exists
or not by using a Visual Basic program.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two different methods you can use to determine if a file exists:

<UL><LI>Use the DIR/DIR$ command to determine if a file exists. This
   method is shown in the example below. The example performs a DIR
   on the filename and checks the return value. If the return value
   is "" (nothing), then the file doesn't exist.

<LI>Use the OPEN statement to open a file for input and an error trap.
   This method can run into problems when dealing with SHARE in Windows.
   If the file does not exist, a trappable error occurs. The only
   problem with this method is if the file that is being opened with
   the OPEN statement is in use, you will generate a sharing violation,
   which is a system level error that is not trappable from Visual Basic.
<P>
</UL><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 
<P>
This example show how to check for the existence of a file by using the
DIR$ function.

<OL><P><LI>Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add a CommandButton (Command1) to Form1.

<P><LI>Place the following code in the Command1_Click Event:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Command1_Click()
         Dim TheFile as String
         Dim Results as String
   
         TheFile = "C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT"
         Results = Dir$(TheFile)
   
         If Results  = "" Then
            MsgBox "File Doesn't Exist!"
         Else
            MsgBox "File does Exist!"
         End If
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Run the program, and click the Command1 button.

<P><LI>Stop the program and make the TheFile variable point to a file that
   doesn't exist.

<P><LI>Run the program again, and click the Command1 button.
<P>
</OL><h3>Error in Visual Basic Help File Code</h3>
 
<P>
Please note that there is an error in the sample that is provided with
the Visual Basic 3.0 Help file (NOTE: This only applies to Visual Basic
3.0, the samples provided with Visual Basic 4.0 and 5.0 are correct).
The first line of the following If block is incorrect:
<P>
<PRE>      If GetAttr(Path + DirName) And ATTR_DIRECTORY = ATTR_DIRECTORY Then
         If (Count Mod 10) = 0 Then
            ReDim Preserve D(Count + 10)  ' Resize the array.
         End If
         Count = Count + 1  ' Increment counter.
         D(Count) = DirName
      End If

</PRE></OL>Here's the correct version (only difference is the first line):
<P>
<PRE>      If GetAttr(path + DirName) = ATTR_DIRECTORY Then
         If (Count Mod 10) = 0 Then
            ReDim Preserve D(Count + 10) ' Resize the array.
         End If
         Count = Count + 1 ' Increment counter.
         D(Count) = DirName
      End If
