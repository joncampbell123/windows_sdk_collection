<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article explains each section in the Visual Basic Initialization file
(VB.INI) distributed with the Professional Edition. You'll find the VB.INI
file in your \WINDOWS directory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The VB.INI file is amended when you make a change by using the environment
options menu of Visual Basic, or you quit or start Visual Basic. The VB.INI
file is not documented in the manual; the various parts are deciphered and
described below. Each line is described in the comments shown below it.
<P>
The following codes keep track of the various positions of the design
environment windows. The format of each is left, top, width, height and the
display state:
<P>
<PRE>   1,5,9  Normal with focus
   2      Minimized with focus (default)
   3      Maximized with focus
   4,8    Normal without focus
   6,7    Minimized without focus
