The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for
<PRE>  Windows, versions 2.0 and 3.0
</PRE>- Microsoft Visual Basic programming system for Windows, version 1.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you have more than one frame (or group) of option buttons, Visual
Basic correctly marks one button as active (with a dot) in the first
group of option buttons, but initially fails to place a dot anywhere
in additional groups (or frames) of option buttons. You must manually
click an option button in the additional group for the dot to appear
in that group.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
If you want a particular option button selected (containing the dot)
in a group or frame, set that button's Value property in the Form_Load
event Procedure. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   Option3.Value = -1

</PRE>This will place a dot in the Option3 button in addition to the dot in
the Option1 button when you run the program again.
<P>
Note that you cannot place a dot in both the Option1 button and
the Option2 button if they are both placed in the same frame. By putting
a group of options in one frame, you are specifying that the user may
choose only one of the grouped options.
<P>
Note also that buttons on a form outside any frame behave as a group.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic with a new project.

<P><LI>Draw two frames on the form, with one frame being half the size of
   the form and the other frame being the other half of the form.

<P><LI>Place two option buttons in each of the frames by selecting the
   Option Button tool from the Toolbox and pointing, clicking, and
   dragging the option buttons onto the frames.

<P><LI>Run the program by pressing the F5 key. Note that there is only one
   option button containing a dot.
