<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The RichTextBox control allows you to create RTF documents from within your
Visual Basic program. However, when you want to insert a TAB character in
the RichTextBox control, the focus is instead moved to the next control in
the tab order specified by the TabIndex property. This article explains how
you can insert the TAB character into the RichTextBox control itself.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h2>SETTING A CONTROL'S TAB ORDER</h2>
 
<P>
At run time, a user must press CTRL+TAB to insert a TAB character in a
RichTextBox control. However, most people are accustomed to just simply
pressing the TAB key. Whenever the TAB key is pressed from within a
RichTextBox control, the focus is immediately set to the next control on
the form. The TabIndex property of a control determines which control, then
receives the focus.
<P>
When designing a form in Visual Basic, you add controls such as command
buttons and text boxes to perform functions within your application. Each
time you add a new control to a form, Visual Basic assigns a new value to
that control. This value is saved in the control's TabIndex property.
During run time, a user can press the TAB key to move the focus from one
control to another. The focus is moved to the control that has the next
highest TabIndex value.
<P>
You can change the value of a control's TabIndex property either during
design time or at run time. However, the control must have a TabStop
property associated with it. The TabStop property determines whether a user
can press the TAB key to set the focus to that specific control.
<P>
In the demonstration program below, we change the TabStop property of all
controls on the form to False. While the RichTextBox control has the focus,
the TAB key is prevented from setting the focus to another control. This is
because the TabStop property is set to False. Therefore, the TAB control
character is correctly inserted into the text of the RichTextBox control.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Create the Demonstration Program</h3>
 
<P>
The demonstration program below shows how to insert a TAB control character
in the RichTextBox control provided in Visual Basic 4.0.

<OL><P><LI>Create a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add a RichTextBox control to Form1.

<P><LI>Add the following code to the GotFocus event for RichTextBox1.
<P>
<PRE>   Private Sub RichTextBox1_GotFocus()
       On Error Resume Next
       For Each Control In Controls
           Control.TabStop = False
       Next Control
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Add a Command Button control to Form1.
<P>
</OL>Execute the demonstration program by pressing the F5 function key. The
focus is set to the RichTextBox control. Type some text into the
RichTextBox control. Whenever desired, you can press the TAB key to insert
that control character into the text you are typing. Notice that pressing
TAB does not move the focus to the Command Button control--you must click
the mouse pointer on the command button itself to move the focus to it. In
other words, while the focus is set to the RichTextBox control, you can
press the TAB key and that character is inserted into the RichTextBox
control.
