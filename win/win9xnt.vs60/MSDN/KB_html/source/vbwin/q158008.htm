<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article illustrates some techniques using the MSComm32.OCX control for
receiving and transmitting binary data on double-byte character set (DBCS)
Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Communications control, MSCOMM32.OCX, provides serial communications
for your application by allowing the transmission and reception of data
through a serial port where only a string of characters to the transmit
buffer is permitted. This feature limits you to transmitting only text-
based files.
<P>
The binary data must be converted one byte at a time to a character and
then transmitted. When received, the data must be converted from a
character back into binary data one byte at a time. See the REFERENCES
section below for more information.
<P>
On double-byte character set Windows, such as Korean, Japanese, and Chinese
Windows, binary data will be corrupted if one of the binary values matches
a DBCS lead character. The MSComm control will interpret this byte and the
following byte as one double-byte character and return only one byte for
the equivalent ASCII character. To resolve this problem, which is specific
to DBCS Windows, you can implement certain encoding algorithms that can
convert binary data into text data and vice versa. This article
demonstrates how to convert one byte binary data into ASCII size of three
characters to preserve the lead character. On the receiving end, these
three ASCII characters are converted back into one-byte binary data.
For example:
<P>
<PRE>   ASC('a') = 97  ' 97

</PRE>would be transmitted as three characters:
<P>
<PRE>   '0''9''7'

</PRE>NOTE: The sample code is reading the input file as binary. It is not
necessary to convert each character to ASCII value.
<P>
If you use a modem instead of RS-232 cable, you need to add some codes to
establish the modem connection. For example:

<UL><LI>MSComm1.Output = 'ATDT 999-9999' for Transmitter

<LI>and -

<LI>MSComm1.Output = 'AT' for Receiver
<P>
</UL>Once the connection is established, everything should work the same way.

</PRE><P><LI>Make sure that the Properties of MSComm1 are changed as follows:
<P>

</PRE><P>
</OL>The Transmitter and Receiver codes should be compiled separately and placed
on two separate machines where one machine is the designated transmitter
and the other one is the receiver.
<P>
The event-driven technique generates an OnComm event when there are
characters waiting in the input buffer. Also, the CommEvent property will
contain a numeric 2. For the OnComm event to be triggered, you must set the
Rthreshold property to a value other than its default of zero. The most
common setting for the RThreshold property is 1, meaning that the OnComm
event is triggered if a minimum of one character is waiting in the input
buffer. In this article, the numeric 3 is being used as a value of
RThreshold property because 3 characters at a time are being sent.
