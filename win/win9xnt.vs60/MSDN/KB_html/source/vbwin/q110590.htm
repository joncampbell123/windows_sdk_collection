<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article lists some of the common error messages that you get when you
try to connect to a Paradox version 4.x database in Visual Basic 3.0 with
the Microsoft Jet 2.0/Visual Basic 3.0 Compatibility Layer. This article
also lists many of the errors' causes.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following is a list of some of the common error messages you may
encounter when working with the Paradox version 4.x database from Microsoft
Visual Basic version 3.0:
<P>
<P><h3>Couldn't find net path or user name</h3>
 
<P>
When you try to connect to a Paradox version 4.x database, you may receive
the error message, "Couldn't find net path or user name." This error
message usually indicates that one or more Paradox initialization settings
is missing or incorrect. All initialization files for the database engine
should have the correct entries for the [Paradox ISAM] section. This
includes the VB.INI, MSACC20.INI, and any application initialization files
that are using the Jet 2.0 database engine. The initialization files must
have a [Paradox ISAM] section similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   [Paradox ISAM]
   ParadoxUserName=joe
   ParadoxNetPath=N:\SYSTEM
   ParadoxNetStyle=4.x
   CollatingSequence=Ascii

</PRE>The ParadoxUserName must be set to the name of the user accessing the
Paradox database.
<P>
ParadoxNetPath must be a valid path to the file PDOXUSRS.NET. The
PDOXUSRS.NET file is used to manage multiuser access to Paradox databases.
It is very important that all applications in a multiuser situation have
the same path to the PDOXUSRS.NET file. This includes applications using
the Jet 2.0 database engine, applications using a Paradox ODBC driver, and
any other programs that may be accessing Paradox databases.
<P>
ParadoxNetStyle must be set to 4.x in the initialization files of any
program using the Access 2.0 database engine to read Paradox version 4.x
databases, if the PDOXUSRS.NET file style is 4.x. Otherwise, the
ParadoxNetStyle should be set to 3.x.
<P>
If the ParadoxUserName, ParadoxNetPath, or ParadoxNetStyle entry is not
present in the initialization file, you will receive the error message,
"Couldn't find net Path or user name."
<P>
<P><h3>Couldn't open PDOXUSRS.NET</h3>
 
<P>
When you try to connect to a Paradox version 4.x database, you may also
receive the error message, "Couldn't open PARADOX.NET." This error message
can indicate that the path specified in one of your initialization files is
incorrect. If this happens, verify that all applications accessing the
Paradox version 4.x database have the same path to the PDOXUSRS.NET file
and that the path is correct. In particular, check the ParadoxNetPath entry
in the VB.INI (application initialization) file.
<P>
<P><h3>Reserved error (-5030); there is no message for this error</h3>
 
<P>
It is also possible for you to receive the error message, "Reserved error (-
5030); there is no message for this error" when you try to connect to a
Paradox version 4.x database in Visual Basic. This error message can
indicate that the ParadoxNetStyle entry is incorrect. Typically, the
ParadoxNetStyle is set to 3.x when it should be set to 4.x. If this
happens, verify that ParadoxNetStyle entries for applications using the
Access 2.0 database engine are set to 4.x.
<P>
<P><h3>Reserved error (-5029); there is no message for this error</h3>
 
<P>
Another possible error message is "Reserved error (-5029); there is no
message for this error." This error message can indicate that multiple
users are trying to open a Paradox database with correct but different
ParadoxNetPath entries. For example, if one user has a ParadoxNetPath of
X:\PDN and another user has a net path of Z:\PDN, the error message occurs
if both X: and Z: point to the same location on the network where the
PDOXUSRS.NET file is located. To fix the problem, both users have to write
the exact same ParadoxNetPath (in this case, either X:\PDN or Z:\PDN).
<P>
<P><h3>Couldn't find installable ISAM</h3>
 
<P>
The error message, "Couldn't find installable ISAM" occurs if your connect
string does not correctly specify "Paradox 4.x" as the ISAM database or if
you do not have a corresponding entry in the [Installable ISAM] section of
your INI file.
<P>
Please see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article for complete
information on setting up an INI file and using the [Installable ISAM]
section:

   TITLE     : Possible Reasons for Couldn't Find Installable ISAM Error

</PRE>NOTE: For Paradox version 4.x databases, you must use the updated
PDX200.DLL file provided with the Compatibility Layer rather then the
PDX110.DLL file mentioned in article <B><A href="../vbwin/q107672.htm">Q107672</A></B>.
