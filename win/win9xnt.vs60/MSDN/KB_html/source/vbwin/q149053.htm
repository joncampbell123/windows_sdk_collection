SUMMARY
 
<P>
This article describes how to certify your Visual Basic for Windows
application with the Microsoft Windows Logo Program.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft Windows Logo Program</h3>
 
<P>
The Windows Compatible Logo denotes your product's compatibility with
Microsoft Windows. In addition, licensing the Windows Compatible Logo
indicates that your product has been developed specifically to take
advantage of the Windows operating system.
<P>
For software products to qualify, the product must be written to the
Windows API, include a Windows-based automated installation program, be
tested on Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, and
Microsoft Windows NT operating systems, and pass the Windows Compatibility
Survey. To request a kit to license this the Windows Logo, fax your company
name and address to:
<P>
- (425) 936-7329 (Attn: Windows Logo Department)
<P>
For hardware products to qualify, the product must require a Windows
driver, include a Windows-based automated installation, and pass testing by
the Microsoft Compatibility Labs (MCL). For more information on MCL, see
the next section.
