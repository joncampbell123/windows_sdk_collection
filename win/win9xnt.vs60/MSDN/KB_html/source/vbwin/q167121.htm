   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services


</PRE>To install the new version of COMCTL32.OCX, download COMCTLZP.EXE. This is
a self-extracting zip file that will extract two files when executed. The
first file is README.TXT which contains instructions very similar to this
article. The second file is COMCTL32.EXE. This file is a setup program that
will install COMCTL32.OCX and supporting files on Windows 95, Windows NT
4.0, and Windows NT 3.51 with Service Pack 5.
<P>
Before executing COMCTL32.EXE, you must have the following versions of the
Automation system files on your system:
<P>
<PRE>   Filename       Version
   ------------   --------------------
   OLEAUT32.DLL   2.20.4054 or greater
     COMCAT.DLL   4.71      or greater
   OLEPRO32.DLL   5.00.4055 or greater
   ASYCFILT.DLL   2.20.4056 or greater
    STDOLE2.TLB   2.20.4054 or greater

</PRE>If you do not have these files, you must first download and install them as
documented in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../vstudio/q164529.htm">Q164529</A></B>
   TITLE     : FILE: Updated Automation System Files

</PRE>If you have Office 97, Visual Basic 5.0, Visual Studio 97, Internet
Explorer 3.0, or Visual C++ 5.0, you should already have these Automation
system files.
<P>
Once you are sure you have the correct Automation system files on your
computer, you can install COMCTL32.OCX by executing COMCTL32.EXE. This will
install the following files:
<P>
<PRE>   Filename       Version     Description
   ------------   ---------   ------------------------------------
   COMCTL32.OCX   5.00.3828   Updated ActiveX control
   COMCTL32.DEP   5.00.3828   Dependency info for Visual Basic 5.0 Setup
                              Wizard
   MSSTKPRP.DLL   5.00.3714   Design-Time Stock Property Pages

</PRE>The setup program does not install a license to use COMCTL32.OCX for
development. You must already have a license installed on your system by
one of the products listed in the applies to section above in order to
COMCTL32.OCX for development.
<P>
Version 5.00.3828 of COMCTL32.OCX fixes two specific problems in version
5.00.3714 of the control. For more information, please see the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../vbwin/q167122.htm">Q167122</A></B>
   TITLE     : FIX: FindItem Method of ListView Incorrectly Returns an
               Error

   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../vbwin/q167123.htm">Q167123</A></B>
   TITLE     : FIX: COMCTL32.OCX is Binary Incompatible with Previous
               Version

</PRE>The Visual Basic 4.0 Setup Kit was not designed to distribute version
5.00.3828 of COMCTL32.OCX. For COMCTL32.OCX to be deployed correctly the
Automation System Files must be deployed also. One quick way to do this is
to simply provide your users with OADIST.EXE and ask them to install it
first before installing your Visual Basic 4.0 Setup Wizard created setup.
Visual Basic 4.0 developers may also want to update the SWDEPEND.INI
entries for COMCTL32.OCX to remove any unnecessary dependencies for the new
control. This prevents the Visual Basic 4.0 Setup Wizard from distributing
unnecessary files.
