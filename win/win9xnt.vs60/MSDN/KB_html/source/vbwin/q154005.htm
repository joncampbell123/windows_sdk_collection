<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to use the Visual Basic function called KILL to
enable a user to delete a file from disk. Under Windows 95, there is an
additional feature of deleting files into the Recycle bin, giving a user
the ability to reclaim deleted files. The KILL function doesn't offer this
to the Visual Basic Programmer, but the SHFileOperation Win32 API does.
Below is a code sample showing how to use the API in Visual Basic.
