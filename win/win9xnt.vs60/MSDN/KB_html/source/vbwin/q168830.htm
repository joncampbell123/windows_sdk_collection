<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When using an object that has multiple interfaces, you may be faced with
assigning it to multiple variables of different object types to get at
relevant interfaces. This is made more difficult by having to keep track of
the different variables and clean them up properly. This article gives code
for a simple function to allow casting an object to a different interface
without the need to create additional object variables or keep track of
them.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The sample code below illustrates a common problem when utilizing objects
that have multiple interfaces:
<P>
<PRE>   Dim Shape As IShape, C As ICircle, S As ISquare
   Set C = New ICircle
   Set Shape = C
   Shape.SetXY 100, 100
   C.Radius = 50
   Shape.Draw Me
   Set C = Nothing
   Set S = New ISquare
   Set Shape = S            ' Critical line
   Shape.SetXY 300, 200
   S.Side = 50
   Shape.Draw Me
   Set Shape = Nothing
   Set S = Nothing

</PRE>If you forget to set the Shape object to S on the "Critical line," you will
still be manipulating the Circle object in subsequent code. In addition,
it's difficult to tell you are using the Shape object to get at additional
interfaces or what object it's currently set to.
<P>
To clear up this problem, create global functions in your application to
cast the variables to their alternate interfaces. The example above
requires only one function to cast to the IShape interface:
<P>
<PRE>   Function IShape(oShape As IShape) As IShape
     Set IShape = oShape
   End Function

</PRE>You can then reference this function to perform the casting:
<P>
<PRE>   IShape(C).SetXY 100, 100
   C.Radius = 50
   IShape(C).Draw Me

</PRE>Or more efficiently:
<P>
<PRE>   With IShape(C)
     .SetXY 100, 100
     C.Radius = 50
     .Draw Me
   End With

</PRE>You no longer have to define, set, or otherwise keep track of additional
variables for casting purposes. Giving the function the same name as the
interface helps with program clarity.
