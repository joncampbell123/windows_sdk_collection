The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Standard, Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft
   Visual Basic, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A Visual Basic program runs properly on the development computer. The
executable file, along with the associated control (.OCX) and .DLL files,
are copied to another computer. Attempting to run the program on the other
computer results in the error 424 with the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   "You do not have an appropriate license to use functionality"

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 

<UL><LI>The controls or DLLs used by the program were not registered in the
   system registry of the other computer.

<LI>Some controls used by the program require dependency files that need to
   be installed and registered in the other computer.

<LI>Some files, such as those for JET, are required to be in specific
   directories.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use the Setup Wizard in Visual Basic to create an installation program that
copies all the required files to the correct locations and makes the proper
registry modifications. To install the program into another computer, use
the installation program and the compressed files developed using Setup
Wizard to properly install the program.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Visual Basic version 4.0 uses substantially more OLE components than
version 3.0. These components have dependency files and require system
registry modifications. Even if another setup program is used, Setup Wizard
should be run on your application to allow the Wizard to determine all the
necessary files needed by your program.
<P>
To reduce the number of required program files, remove unneeded controls
from the project in the Custom Controls dialog box by following the steps
below:

<OL><P><LI>From the Tools menu, click Custom Controls, or press CTRL+T to display
   the Custom Controls dialog box.

<P><LI>In the Custom Controls dialog box, clear the checkboxes of the unneeded
   controls. Click OK to close this dialog box.

<P><LI>From the Tools menu, click References to display the References dialog
   box. Clear the checkboxes of the unneeded controls. Click OK to close
   this dialog box.
<P></OL>
