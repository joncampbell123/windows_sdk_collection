<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you try to print rotated text using the Printer object from Visual Basic
5.0 with Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2 using the technique described in
the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article, the text fails to rotate:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../vbwin/q154515.htm">Q154515</A></B>
   TITLE     : HOWTO: Print Rotated Text Using Win32 API

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There is a problem in Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2 for Visual Basic 5.0
where any Font selected for the Printer.hDC is ignored by the Printer
object.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, print with API functions entirely without
using the Printer object.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft Visual Studio 97
Service Pack 2 (SP2.) We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The technique described in Knowledge Base article <B><A href="../vbwin/q154515.htm">Q154515</A></B>, prints to a
PictureBox control but will also work using the Printer object. Printing to
a PictureBox still works in SP2 but fails using the Printer object. The
following code example will work from Visual Basic 4.0 or Visual Basic 5.0,
with or without a Service Pack. Because this code creates a Device Context
(DC) for your printer and you can only print to one DC at a time, it has
the limitation that you cannot use the Printer object at the same time. So,
you must end this document before returning to using the Printer object.
