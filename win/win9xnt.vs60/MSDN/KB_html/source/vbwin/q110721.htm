The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for
<PRE>  Windows, version 3.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You cannot distribute the CRW.EXE file to other users. CRW.EXE is the
Crystal report-designer environment for making custom reports.
<P>
To distribute custom reports that you made using CRW.EXE, add a Crystal
Custom Control to your program. You can attach your custom report to the
Crystal Custom Control by using the ReportFileName property. Visual Basic
can compile that program into an executable .EXE file. If you want to
distribute that program to other people who do not have Visual Basic
version 3.0 installed, you need to include additional files listed in the
More Information section below.
<P>
For an example showing how to use the Crystal Custom Control, run the
CRVBXSAM.MAK sample project located in the Report directory in Visual
Basic.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can run the Crystal Reports design environment in any of the following
ways:

<UL><LI>From the Window menu in Visual Basic, choose Report Designer.

<LI>In the Visual Basic 3.0 program group in Windows Program Manager,
   double-click the "Crystal Reports for Visual Basic" icon.

<LI>In File Manager in Windows, double-click the CRW.EXE file located in
   the Report directory in your Visual Basic directory.

<LI>You can use the Shell function to invoke the Crystal Reports design
   environment from an executable program written in Visual Basic. For
   example:
<P>
<P><PRE>      x = Shell("CRW.EXE")
</PRE><P>
</UL>Microsoft does not allow you to distribute the Crystal Reports design
environment (CRW.EXE) with your application. To access Crystal Reports from
executable program written in Visual Basic, add a Crystal Custom Control to
your program. You can make executable .EXE program files from programs that
contain a Crystal Custom Control. If you want to distribute, sell, or test
that .EXE file on another computer that does not have Visual Basic version
3.0 for Windows installed, you need to distribute the following files with
that .EXE file:
<P>
<PRE>   CRYSTAL.VBX       Crystal Custom Control file
   CRPE.DLL          Interface to the print engine.
   COMMDLG.DLL       Printer and file selection dialog box routines.
   CRXLATE.DLL       Only needed if your program uses ToWords() function.

 * PDIRJET.DLL       Crystal engine DLL.
 * PDBJET.DLL        Crystal engine DLL.
 * MSAJT110.DLL      Microsoft Access engine DLL.
 * MSAES110.DLL      Microsoft Access engine DLL.
** MSABC110.DLL      Microsoft Access engine DLL.
** CTL3D.DLL         Microsoft Access engine DLL.
   VB.INI            Visual Basic initialization file.

</PRE>NOTES:
<P>
<PRE> * Files marked with one or two asterisks should be added to the list on

   page 582 in the "Visual Basic Version 3.0: Programmer's Guide."

</PRE>** Files marked with two asterisks need to be added to the list in
<PRE>   Appendix A of the "Crystal Reports for Visual Basic User's Manual."

</PRE>Visual Basic's run-time dynamic link library must also be distributed with
any executable Visual Basic program:
<P>
<PRE>   VBRUN300.DLL

</PRE>If you are making reports with ODBC, ODBC SQL Server, ODBC Oracle, Paradox,
dBASE, or Btrieve, you will need to distribute additional database-specific
files. See the REFERENCES section below.
