<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Registry is used by Windows 95 to determine what application programs
and hardware items are installed in the computer system. This article
explains how to retrieve the name of the default printer from the Registry
from within a Visual Basic application program.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Manipulating the Registry in Visual Basic</h3>
 
<P>
The Windows 95 Registry is a database of information containing
configuration details about the hardware and software installed in your
computer system. Under Windows 3.1, this information is maintained through
initialization (INI) files.
<P>
The Registry is comprised of keys. Each key may contain a specific value or
other subkeys, which in turn may contain values or other subkeys. You can
examine or modify the contents of the registration database by using the
Win32 Registry API functions in a Visual Basic program or by using the
Registry Editor (REGEDIT).
<P>
The demonstration program below shows how to use the Win32 Registry API
functions to retrieve the default printer's name from the Registry.

<OL><P><LI>The first step to retrieve the printer name is to call the RegOpenKeyEx
   function. This function opens the specified key in the registration
   database. In our case, we want to open the key that is associated with
   the printer. This key is stored in the Registry as:
<P>
   System
<P><PRE>      Current Control Set
<PRE></PRE>         Control
            Print
               Printers
                  Default

   All of the above items are keys and subkeys. We are interested in the
   Printers subkey.

   We also need to tell the RegOpenKeyEx function that we want to work with
   the Default subkey. After calling this function, a value is returned
   that is set to zero if the function was successful.

</PRE><P><LI>The next step is to retrieve the actual value stored for the key we are
   interrogating. Because we want to retrieve the name that is assigned to
   the default printer, we want to call the RegQueryValueEx function. We
   must tell this function that we want to retrieve the value that was
   given to the Default subkey.

<P><LI>The last step is mandatory. You must call the RegCloseKey function to
   release the handle of the key you have been accessing in the
   Registration database. This terminates access to the registration
   database and frees the handle for future use by the computer system.
<P>
</OL><h3>How to Create the Demonstration Program</h3>
 
<P>
The demonstration program below shows how to retrieve the name of the
default printer from the Windows 95 Registry.

<OL><P><LI>Create a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add the following constant and Declare statements to the General
   Declarations section of Form1.
<P>
<P><PRE>      Private Declare Function RegOpenKeyEx Lib "advapi32" Alias _
      "RegOpenKeyExA" (ByVal hKey As Long, ByVal lpSubKey As String, _
      ByVal dwReserved As Long, ByVal samDesired As Long, phkResult _
      As Long) As Long
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Private Declare Function RegQueryValueEx Lib "advapi32" Alias _
      "RegQueryValueExA" (ByVal hKey As Long, ByVal lpValueName$, ByVal _
      lpdwReserved As Long, lpdwType As Long, lpData As Any, lpcbData As _
      Long) As Long
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Private Declare Function RegCloseKey Lib "advapi32" (ByVal hKey As _
      Long) As Long
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Const HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG As Long = &amp;H80000005
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add a Text Box control to Form1.

<P><LI>Add a Command Button control to Form1.

<P><LI>Add the following code to the Click event for Command1.
<P>
<P><PRE>      Private Sub Command1_Click()
<PRE></PRE>          Dim PName As String
          PName = GetCurrPrinter()
          Text1.Text = PName
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Create a new procedure called GetCurrPrinter. Add the following code to
   this procedure.
<P>
<P><PRE>      Function GetCurrPrinter() As String
<PRE></PRE>          GetCurrPrinter = RegGetString$(HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG, _
      "System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Printers", "Default")
      End Function

</PRE><P><LI>Create a new procedure called RegGetString. Add the following code to
   this procedure.
<P>
<P><PRE>    Function RegGetString$(hInKey As Long, ByVal subkey$, ByVal valname$)
<PRE></PRE>        Dim RetVal$, hSubKey As Long, dwType As Long, SZ As Long
        Dim R As Long

        RetVal$ = ""
        Const KEY_ALL_ACCESS As Long = &amp;HF0063
        Const ERROR_SUCCESS As Long = 0
        Const REG_SZ As Long = 1

        R = RegOpenKeyEx(hInKey, subkey$, 0, KEY_ALL_ACCESS, hSubKey)
        If R &lt;&gt; ERROR_SUCCESS Then GoTo Quit_Now

        SZ = 256: v$ = String$(SZ, 0)
        R = RegQueryValueEx(hSubKey, valname$, 0, dwType, ByVal v$, SZ)
        If R = ERROR_SUCCESS And dwType = REG_SZ Then
            RetVal$ = Left$(v$, SZ)
        Else
            RetVal$ = "--Not String--"
        End If
        If hInKey = 0 Then R = RegCloseKey(hSubKey)
    Quit_Now:
        RegGetString$ = RetVal$
    End Function

</PRE></OL>Execute the demonstration program by pressing the F5 function key. When you
click the Command Button control, the name of your default printer is
displayed in the Text Box control.
