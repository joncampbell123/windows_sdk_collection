The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Professional Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows,
<PRE>  version 3.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Visual Basic MCI Control doesn't allow volume control of a Windows
sound file. The volume can be controlled through the Multimedia API by
using the waveOutSetVolume function. You can also use the function
waveOutGetVolume() to read the current volume settings.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The waveOutSetVolume() function sets the volume of a waveform output
device. With this function, you can control the right- and left-channel
volume settings independently.
<P>
<P><h3>Declaration Syntax</h3>
 
<P>
Use one the following Declare statements to declare the waveOutGetVolume()
Windows API function in your Visual Basic program:
<P>
<PRE>'Enter each Declare statement as one, single line:
Declare Function waveOutSetVolume Lib "MMSYSTEM.DLL"
   (ByVal wDeviceID as Integer, ByVal dwVolume as Long) as Integer
Declare Function waveOutGetVolume Lib "MMSYSTEM.DLL"
   (ByVal wDeviceID as Integer, dwVolume as Long) as Integer

</PRE>As an alternative, you can declare the waveOutSetVolume function by passing
the dwVolume parameter as two separate integers, one for the left-channel
setting and one for the right-channel setting. Pass the high-order word
first and then the low-order word.
<P>
<PRE>'Enter the following Declare statement as one, single line:
Declare Function waveOutSetVolume Lib "MMSYSTEM.DLL"
   (ByVal wDeviceID as Integer, ByVal dwVolumeRight as Integer
   ByVal dwVolumeLeft as Integer) as Integer

</PRE><h3>Parameters Explained</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>wDeviceID   This parameter identifies the waveform-output device. If
            you were to play one wave file, you would set this
            parameter to 0. If  you were to play multiple wave files, you
            would set this parameter to 1 for the second, 2 for the third,
            and so on.

dwVolume    For the waveOutSetVloume function, this parameter specifies
            the new volume setting. For the waveOutGetVolume
            function, it specifies a far pointer to a location that will be
            filled with the current volume setting.

            The low-order word contains the left-channel volume setting,
            and the high-order word contains the right-channel volume
            setting.

            A value of &amp;HFFFF represents full volume, and a value of
            &amp;H0000 represents no volume.

            If a device does not support both left and right volume
            control, the low-order word of dwVolume specifies the volume
            level, and the high-order word is ignored.

</PRE><h3>Return Value</h3>
 
<P>
?? returns zero if the function is successful.  Otherwise, it returns an
error number.  Possible return values are:

<UL><LI>MMSYSERR_INVALIHANDLE = 5      Specific device handle is invalid
<LI>MMSYSERR_NOTSUPPORTED = 8      Function isn't supported
<LI>MMSYSERR_NODRIVER     = 6      The driver was not installed
<P>
</UL>NOTE: Not all devices support volume changes or volume control on both the
left and right channels. Most devices do not support the full 16 bits of
volume-level control and will not use the high-order bits.
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 
<P>
This example demonstrates how to use the waveOutSetVolume(),
waveOutGetVolume(), and sndPlaySound Multimedia API functions to
increase or decrease the sound in either the left or right channels:

<OL><P><LI>Start a new project in Visual Basic; Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add the following controls to Form1 and set their properties as
   indicated:

                     Caption     Left Down

   Command Button    Name        RightUp

   Label             Name        RightVol


</PRE><P><LI>Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1:
<P>
<PRE>   ' Enter each of the following Declare statements as one, single line:
   Declare Function sndPlaySound Lib "MMSYSTEM.DLL"
      (ByVal lpszSoundName As String, ByVal wFlags As Integer) As Integer
   Declare Function waveoutSetVolume Lib "mmsystem.dll"
      (ByVal wDeviceID As Integer, ByVal dwVolumeRight As Integer,
      ByVal dwVolumeLeft As Integer) As Integer
   Declare Function waveOutGetVolume Lib "MMSYSTEM.DLL"
      (ByVal wDeviceID As Integer, lpdwvolume As Long) As Integer

   Const SND_ASYNC = &amp;H1
   Const SND_NODEFAULT = &amp;H2

   Dim CurrentVolLeft As Long
   Dim CurrentVolRight As Long

</PRE><P><LI>Add the sample code shown below to the appropriate Form or Control event
   procedure.

<P><LI>Save your work, and run the program.

<P><LI>You will see the current channel setting in the labels. Choose
   the Play Sound button to hear the tada wave file play.

<P><LI>Click one of the other command buttons to change either the left- or
   right-channel setting, and then click the Play Sound command button
   again.  The volume level has changed.

   ' This code isolates the low-order word.
   ' Note that the value &amp;HFFFF&amp; is a Long Integer, which is the same

   ' truncate this to FFFF, you must force the logical operation to use
   ' a four-byte Long Integer (0000FFFF) rather than a two-byte Integer
   ' (FFFF). This is accomplished by using the type casting
   ' character (&amp;).
