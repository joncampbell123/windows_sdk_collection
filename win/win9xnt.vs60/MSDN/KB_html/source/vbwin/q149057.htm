<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses some advanced topics regarding RDO Dynamic cursors
that are not explained in the Visual Basic documentation. Use it as a
supplement to Understanding Cursors and Choosing a Cursor Type found in the
Visual Basic online Help by doing an indexed find on the keyword Cursors.
<P>
Use the Visual Basic online Help and the Building Client/Server
Applications guide to get more general information on the different types
of RDO cursors.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Dynamic cursors have no fixed membership of rows. As you move from
one rowset to another (number of rows in a rowset is determined by the
RowsetSize property), the driver may return any set of rows. This new
rowset might include new rows added to the table that happen to match the
where clause, but it's hard to know where the new rows will actually
show up (maybe at the end).
<P>
RDO only goes back to the server when it needs another rowset of data
(again, number of rows in a rowset is determined by the RowsetSize
property), so changes by other users won't show up until the rowset
boundary is crossed. Adjusting the RowsetSize property is done to balance
performance against freshness of data. Because frequent trips to the server
are very expensive, it is not advisable, in a client/server environment
where a network is involved, to ping back to the server every time you move
to a new row - the Jet database engine does this and it is not as fast as
RDO across the network.
<P>
Bookmarks are not supported in Dynamic cursors - the Bookmarkable
property will always be false for a dynamic cursor. The SQL Server
driver doesn't give bookmarks in dynamic cursors because there is no
immutable row id in SQL Server. Bookmarks work within rowsets but not
across them, so the Bookmarkable property is set to false.
<P>
SQL Server cannot be implemented like an ISAM database. The design goal is
to make a client/server system scalable. RDO allows you to refresh data
constantly by setting the RowsetSize = 1, but this results in network round-
trips (by definition) every time you move, and hinder you on a slower
network or when many users are on the system. This is not an efficient way
to implement client/server programming, and no DBMS or development tool can
address the fact that network round-trip's takes time. RDO uses ODBC
without introducing any magic on top, which is why it is both fast and
small.
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Program</h3>
 
<P>
This example describes how to set up a dynamic rdoResultset. It uses a
DSN-less ODBC connection so it is not necessary to set up a DSN with the
ODBC Admin utility.

<OL><P><LI>Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default. Add
   a CommandButton to Form1.

<P><LI>Paste the following code into the General Declarations section of Form1.
<P>
<P><PRE>      Private Sub Command1_Click()
<PRE></PRE>        Dim en As rdoEnvironment
        Dim cn As rdoConnection
        Dim rs As rdoResultset
        Dim sql As String
   
        'establish connection
        Set en = rdoEngine.rdoEnvironments(0)
        en.CursorDriver = rdUseIfNeeded
        'this should be modified to connect to your database
        Dim cnStr As String
   
        cnStr = "driver={SQL Server};server=myserver;" &amp; _
          "database=pubs;uid=myuid;pwd=mypwd"
        Set cn = en.OpenConnection(dsName:="", Prompt:=rdDriverNoPrompt, _
          ReadOnly:=False, Connect:=cnStr)

        'create an SQL statement that matches a table in your database
        sql = "Select * From Titles"
        'the next line opens a Dynamic resultset
        Set rs = cn.OpenResultset(Name:=sql, Type:=rdOpenDynamic, _
          LockType:=rdConcurRowver, Option:=rdAsyncEnable)
        While rs.StillExecuting

        Wend
        'prints first 3 columns of the first row
        Me.Print rs(0), rs(1), rs(2)
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Change your DRIVER, SERVER, DATABASE, UID, and PWD in the
   OpenConnection method. Modify the SQL statement contained in the
   Command1_Click event to match your SQL data source.

<P><LI>Start the program or press the F5 key. Click on the Command1 button
   to start the query, which will display the first 3 columns of the first
   row on the form.
