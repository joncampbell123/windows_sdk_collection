<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The TAB key is often used to navigate sequentially through multiple
controls on a form. The order in which you move through the controls
depends on their TabIndex value, not their position on the form. This
article provides you with a simple method you can use to set up a required
tab sequence.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By default, the TabIndex property is set when you place a control on a form
relative to the other controls on the form. To set up a required tab
sequence, in the design environment, select the control you wish to be last
in the tab sequence. Set its TabIndex to Zero. Select each control in the
opposite direction from that which the user will use to navigate through
the form, and set each control's TabIndex to Zero.
<P>
Each time you set the TabIndex for a control, all the other controls have
their TabIndex recalculated so as you set them to Zero all the other
controls are incremented by one.
