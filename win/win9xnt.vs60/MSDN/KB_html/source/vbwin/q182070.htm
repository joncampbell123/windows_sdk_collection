<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If a Form takes up most of the screen at 640 x 480 (VGA) resolution, it
will only take up a small portion of the screen at 1600 x 1200. Normally,
this is exactly what you want to happen, but some circumstances arise where
you want a Form to retain the same proportional size and position
regardless of screen resolution. This article discusses a simple way to
accomplish this.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When designing Forms to be resized at run-time, keep the following in mind:

<UL><LI>When designing Forms, it is best to design them for the lowest screen
   resolution you expect users to run. Even using the technique outlined
   here, it is best to stay with this rule because Forms resize better
   going to higher resolutions than they do going to lower ones.

<LI>Use TrueType Fonts because they are scalable. Also, try to use Fonts
   that will be available on the user's system. Otherwise, a substituted
   Font may not scale properly.

<LI>Because resizing may not always be exact, especially with Fonts, make
   the controls a little larger than the minimum necessary. Also, try to
   leave a little space between controls.

<LI>Some controls, like CheckBoxes and Option buttons, will not resize, and
   some controls may require special handling. For example, the Height
   property of ComboBoxes is read-only at run-time, but changing the font
   size will adjust the Height.
<P>
</UL><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Change the video resolution to 800 x 600.

<P><LI>Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add a Label, a CommandButton, and any other types of controls you would
   like to test.

      With MyForm
        For I = 0 To .Count - 1

           .Controls(I).Left = .Controls(I).Left * SFX
           .Controls(I).Top = .Controls(I).Top * SFY

           .Controls(I).FontSize = .Controls(I).FontSize * SFFont
        Next I
        If RePosForm Then
          ' Now size the Form
          .Move .Left * SFX, .Top * SFY, .Width * SFX, .Height * SFY
        End If
      End With
      End Sub

</PRE></OL>Try running this under different screen resolutions and the Form should
take up the same desktop area and retain its look and screen position. You
may notice that your design resizes better when changing to a higher
resolution than it does when changing to a lower one. You can also use the
Mouse to Resize the Form and it will re-scale automatically. Finally, if
you change video resolution while the Form is open, you can click on
Command1 and it will adjust for the new resolution.
