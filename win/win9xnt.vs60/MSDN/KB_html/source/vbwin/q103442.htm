The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic programming system for Windows, version 3.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains two references:

<UL><LI>A revised version of the table outlined on the back of the "Professional
   Features Book 2" manual for Microsoft Visual Basic version 3.0
   Programming System for Windows. This table outlines the differences
   in the properties and methods of the three main data access objects
   (table, dynaset, and snapshot) in Visual Basic version 3.0.

<LI>A brief list of the differences between table, database, dynaset,
   querydef, and snapshot objects.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Revised Table for the Back of "Professional Features Book 2"</h3>
 
<P>
The following table lists most of the properties and methods that apply to
each of the database objects.

<UL><LI>Yes means the object does contain the property or method in both the
   Standard and Professional Editions of Visual Basic version 3.0 for
   Windows.

<LI>No means the object does not contain the property or method in either
   the Standard or Professional Edition of Visual Basic version 3.0 for
   Windows.

<LI>Yes/PRO means the object contains the property or method only in the
   Professional Edition, not the Standard Edition, of Visual Basic version
   3.0 for Windows.

<LI>(docerr) highlights that information as a correction to the information
   given in the original table shown on the back of the "Professional
   Features Book 2."

</PRE><h3>List of Differences Between Data Access Objects</h3>
 
<P>
Below, object by object, is a list of differences, recommendations, and
suggestions for each of the various data access objects. The page numbers
refer to pages in the "Professional Features Book 2." Article Q numbers
refer to other Microsoft Knowledge Base articles which give provide
additional information.
<P>
Snapshot Objects

<UL><LI>Snapshots return all of the selected data and Dynasets return only a
   set of keys that indirectly reference the database's records (page 57).
   Therefore when retrieving a small number of records in a recordset,
   you may want to use a dynaset instead of a snapshot unless this is the
   first time you are using a newly created snapshot or dynaset.

<LI>When either a snapshot or a dynaset is first created -- prior to any
   movelast operation -- both the snapshot and the dynaset return one page
   (2048 bytes) of data. The dynaset also fetches the keyset of the
   dynaset. This means that on first creation, snapshots, as the name
   implies, return faster. However, if you were to proceed record by record
   sequentially through the entire recordset, you'd find that the dynaset
   navigates faster -- approximately two times faster. This is because
   navigating by keyset instead of by local pointers is more efficient.

<LI>Snapshots return all the selected data when movelast is executed or when
   the entire recordset is completely navigated. Therefore, in these two
   cases, trying to retrieve a large amount of data (a large number of
   records) could take some time. It may take less time to use Dynasets
   instead of Snapshots in this scenario (page 57).

<LI>Snapshots can become outdated (the data is no longer current) quickly
   in a multiuser environment (page 57).

<LI>Snapshots cannot use the Transaction statements (BeginTrans,
   CommitTrans, and RollBack).

<LI>Snapshots or dynasets cannot use the Seek method because Seek applies
   only to table objects. However, snapshots or dynasets can use the Find
   method instead of the Seek method.

<LI>Snapshots cannot use Edit, AddNew, Delete, or Update properties that
   pertain to data changes made in records. Snapshot objects are a
   read-only type of dynaset.

<LI>Snapshot objects may be good for taking summary reports, since they
   contain a fixed copy of the data as it existed when the snapshot was
   created. If data is changed, a snapshot will not show the change until
   the snapshot is rebuilt (page 57).

<LI>Snapshots can be created from an existing dynaset or snapshot, but you
   cannot create a dynaset from an existing snapshot (page 56).

<LI>Snapshots can contain table name(s), attached tables, querydef objects
   or SQL statements(pg. 56).

<LI>Snapshot object membership is fixed (page 48).
<P>
</UL>Dynasets Objects

<UL><LI>Dynaset and snapshot objects can use the Sort property, but the table
   object and the data control cannot use the Sort property. To sort data
   with a data control, use the ORDER BY clause of an SQL statement or
   query. To sort a table object, set an Index property on a field that
   already has a Index specified (example shown on pages 50 and 75).

<LI>Dynasets are the most flexible of the three objects listed in the table
   above (page 51).

<LI>Dynasets are a dynamic (not fixed) subset of records. Dynasets can
   contain attached tables, table name(s), querydef object name or SQL
   query (page 51).

<LI>Filters are used to screen records to be brought back in dynasets or
   snapshots (page 53). Table objects cannot use filters.

<LI>Dynasets can be locked with a page-locking scheme with a page containing
   a maximum of 2K of data (page 54). Page 54 also mentions pessimistic and
   optimistic locking methods.

<LI>Dynasets that are formed because of a query or SQL string are suspended
   until the query or SQL string returns the first record (page 51).

<LI>Dynaset or snapshot objects can be filtered using the Filter property or
   sorted using the Sort property even further by using a second dynaset or
   snapshot object(page 53).

<LI>Dynaset or snapshot objects are used with querydef objects. Also, the
   ListParameters method returns a snapshot with one record for each
   parameter used by the query (pages 93 and 97).

<LI>Dynaset objects do not reflect changes made by others until you re-
</UL>create
<PRE>   the Dynaset variable or execute the CreateDynaset method with no
   arguments (page 55).

</PRE><LI>Dynaset object membership is fixed, you can add, change, and delete
   records, and a result is returned by a query (page 48).

<LI>Dynaset objects can create an inconsistent dynaset with the
   DB_INCONSISTENT flag. But it may be harder to keep referential
   integrity when this flag is specified (pages 58, 59, and 85).

<LI>To improve performance, you may want to add the option DB_READONLY
   if you are not writing to or allowing the users to make changes to
   database records (pages 58 and 59).
<P>
</UL>Table objects

<UL><LI>Table objects have direct access to the data records (page 49). The
   data in a table object variable always reflects all current changes,
   including the additions of new records and the deletions of existing
   records (page 50).

<LI>Table objects cannot be created from attached tables (page 50).

<LI>Table object membership can change. You can add, change, and delete
   records, but there is no result returned by a query (page 48).

<LI>Table objects cannot use the Find method (page 72).

<LI>Table, database and dynaset objects can be locked, but a snapshot
   object cannot be locked (pages 88 and 89).

<LI>Table objects provide the most up-to-date view of your data because the
   data in a table variable always reflects all current changes (page 50).

<LI>Table objects can be ordered on a Indexed field, the Index property does
   apply. But the Index does not apply to data controls, snapshots or
   dynasets (see example on page 75).

<LI>When looking for a single, specific record, you may want to use the Seek
   method with a table object because it is the fasted way to retrieve a
   single record (page 74).
<P>
</UL>QueryDef Objects

<UL><LI>querydef objects may be more efficient. For example, use a stored query
   of an SQL string as an argument to the recordset of querydef to produce
   a filtered dynaset or snapshot instead of creating a dynaset or snapshot
   and then filtering it (page 67).

<LI>querydef objects do not store data. They store the definition of a
   query used to retrieve data (page 91).

<LI>querydefs can be created only on a Microsoft Access or Visual Basic
   database (page 92).

<LI>querydefs require a name. You must supply a name for the query when you
   create it (page 92).
