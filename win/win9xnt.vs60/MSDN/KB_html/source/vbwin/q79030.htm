<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for
<PRE>  Windows, version 2.0
</PRE>- Microsoft Visual Basic programming system for Windows, version 1.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you click the down arrow of the drive list box control, the drive
list box will not open if it has been resized at run time. The Width
property is Read/Write at run time. However, if it is changed at run
time, the drive list box won't open. This is true even if it is
restored to its original value before attempting to open it.
<P>
Note also that Page 11 of the "Microsoft Visual Basic: Language
Reference" version 1.0, says the Height property of the drive list box
is Read/Write at run time. Height is actually Read-Only at run time.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the products listed above.
This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual Basic version 3.0 for
Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Note that neither the directory list box nor the file list box are
affected by run-time resizing.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Click the drive list box control icon on the Toolbox. Draw a
   drive list box on the form. Resize the drive list box to any size.
   At run time, the drive list box will correctly open when you click
   the down arrow.

<P><LI>Add three command buttons to the form, giving them these captions:
   Narrow, Wider, and Restore.

<P><LI>Insert the following code:
<P>
   Note: The example assumes a starting dimension of 2055 wide (user
   alterable) by 315 high (the standard height in twips).
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Command1_Click ()
      drive1.WIDTH = 1025             ' Narrow
   End Sub

   Sub Command2_Click ()
      drive1.WIDTH = 4110             'Wider
   End Sub

   Sub Command3_Click ()
      drive1.WIDTH = 2055             'Restore
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Run the example.

<P><LI>Open the drive list box. Click the Narrow or Wider button.

<P><LI>Try to open the drive list box again. It fails to open.

<P><LI>Click the Restore button. Again try to open the drive list box.
   It fails to open.
