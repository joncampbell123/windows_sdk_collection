The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Visual Basic programming system for Windows, version 3.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Trying to perform an update on a result set created with the Distinct
predicate results in error 3219 "Can't perform operation, it is illegal."
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
An object variable or a data control result set created with the Distinct
predicate is not updatable according to Help. The following statement is in
the Distinct keyword Help topic:
<P>
<PRE>   The output of a query that uses Distinct is not updatable and doesn't
   reflect subsequent changes made by other users. Therefore, when you use
   the Distinct predicate in a query, you are prevented from trying to
   update your records.

</PRE><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The only workaround at this time is to not use the DISTINCT predicate
to build the results set. Note that you may have to handle the
duplicates by some other coding means.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>

<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic or from the File menu, choose Open Project(ALT, F, O)
   if Visual Basic is already running. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add a data control, two command buttons, and one text box to Form1.

<P><LI>Using the following table as a guide, set the properties of the controls
   you added in step 2.

                                                               which should

   Text1          DataSource     Data1
   Text1          DataField      Author

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following code to Command1 click event procedure:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Command1_Click ()
      '* Enter the following two lines of code as one, single line:
      data1.RecordSource = "Select DISTINCT Author From authors
         where author &gt; 'a'"
      data1.Refresh
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following code to Command2 click event procedure:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Command2_Click ()
      data1.Recordset.Update
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>From the Run menu, choose Start (ALT, R, S), or press the F5 key to run
   the program. Click the Command1 button to set up the Distinct predicate.
   Delete the zero in "Arnson, Robert, 1970." Then click the Command2
   button. This should result in the 3219 error "Can't perform operation,
   it is illegal."
