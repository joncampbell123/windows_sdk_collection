The information in this article applies to:

- The Visual Basic programming system for Windows, versions 2.0 and 3.0
- Microsoft Windows, version 3.1 or higher
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article demonstrates how to call Windows API functions to read a file
of any size (including a huge file such as a bitmap) into memory and how
to write a block of memory (including a huge memory block) out to a file.
<P>
The information in this article applies only to Windows version 3.1 or
higher because it uses Windows API functions introduced in Windows
version 3.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Perform the following steps to create a sample program that demonstrates
how to read a large file into memory and write that memory back out to
a file:

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic or from the File menu, choose New Project (ALT, F, N)
   if Visual Basic is already running. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose New Module (ALT, F, M). Module1 is created.

<P><LI>Add the following code to the general-declarations section of Module1:
