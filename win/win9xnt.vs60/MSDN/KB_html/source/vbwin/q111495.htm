The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for
<PRE>  Windows, versions 2.0 and 3.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article shows by example how to implement the toolbar "ToolTips" help
in a Visual Basic application in a manner similar to the way "ToolTips"
help system is implemented in Microsoft Word version 6.0 for Windows and
Microsoft Excel version 5.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following example implements a "ToolTips" help system by taking
advantage of the GetCursorPos() and WindowFromPoint() Windows API
functions. The GetCursorPos() function returns the current location of the
mouse cursor and the WindowFromPoint() function returns the hWnd (window
handle) of the control or form at a particular location on the screen.
<P>
<P><h3>Important Note: Modifications Required If Using Image Controls</h3>
 
<P>
IMPORTANT NOTE: Most toolbars in Visual Basic are made by using a container
control (picture box) with individual image controls acting as buttons
placed inside the container. The Image control, however, is a "light"
control; it does not have an hWnd property. Because of this, the
WindowFromPoint() Windows API function will not be able to detect which
image control the cursor is over. It will give the hWnd of the image
control's parent, in this case the container.
<P>
Therefore, if you are using image controls as your toolbar buttons (or some
other control that doesn't have an hWnd property), you need to modify this
program. Have it detect when the mouse cursor is over the parent container.
Then calculate which image control the cursor is over by comparing the x
and y coordinate returned by GetCursorPos, which is relative to the screen,
to the coordinates of the image controls, which are relative to the parent
container.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Use the GetCursorPos() and WindowFromPoint() Windows API functions</h3>
 
<P>
By using a timer, you can call the GetCursorPos() and WindowFromPoint() API
functions to find out if the mouse cursor is located over a control for
which you want to display a help window.
<P>
The help window is displayed by using an auto sizing label control on a
separate form. By locating the form relative to the cursor, changing the
label's caption, and resizing the form, you can display the ToolTips help.
Then you can use the ShowWindow() Windows API function to display the help
form without giving it the focus. By using ShowWindow(), you can keep the
main form s title bar from flashing when focus changes. In contrast, the
Show method would cause the title bar to flash.
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Place the following controls on Form1:
<P>
   Timer (Timer1)
   Text Box (Text1)
   List Box (List1)
<PRE>   Combo Box (Combo1)    'See NOTE below
   Check Box (Check1)
   Picture Box (Picture1)
   Option Button (Option1)
   Command Button (Command1)
   Vertical Scroll Bar (vScroll1)
   Horizontal Scroll Bar (hScroll1)

   NOTE: The combo box is a special case. The edit box portion of the combo
   box is a child window of the combo box, so it has a different window
   handle. Therefore, you must make call the GetWindow() Windows API
   function, with the GW_CHILD parameter, in order to get the hWnd of this
   edit box.

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following code to the Form_Load event of Form1:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Form_Load ()

      ' Set timer for 1 second, and enable it.
      Timer1.Interval = 1000
      Timer1.Enabled = True

   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following code to the timer event of Timer1:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Timer1_Timer ()
      Dim curhWnd As Integer      'Current hWnd
      Dim p As POINTAPI
      Static LasthWnd As Integer  'Hold previous hWnd

      ' Make sure the program has the input focus:
      If GetActiveWindow() = Form1.hWnd Then
         ' Initialize point structure:
         Call GetCursorPos(p)
         ' Which window is the mouse cursor over?
         curhWnd = WindowFromPoint(p.y, p.x)

         ' Same as last window? If so, don't need to redraw:
         If curhWnd &lt;&gt; LasthWnd Then
            ' Store the current hWnd:
            LasthWnd = curhWnd
            ' Decrease timer interval to 5 ms (could choose 1 ms):
            Timer1.Interval = 5
            ' Which control is the cursor over?
            Select Case curhWnd
               Case Command1.hWnd
                  DisplayHelp "Command Button"
               Case Text1.hWnd
                  DisplayHelp "Text Box"
               Case List1.hWnd
                  DisplayHelp "List Box"
               Case Picture1.hWnd
                  DisplayHelp "Picture Box"
               Case Check1.hWnd
                  DisplayHelp "Check Box"
               Case Option1.hWnd
                  DisplayHelp "Option Box"
               Case Combo1.hWnd
                  DisplayHelp "Drop Down Combo Box"
               Case GetWindow(Combo1.hWnd, GW_CHILD) 'Edit box of combo box
                  DisplayHelp "Edit Box of Combo Box"
               Case hScroll1.hWnd
                  DisplayHelp "hScroll Bar"
               Case vScroll1.hWnd
                  DisplayHelp "vScroll Bar"
               Case frmHelp.hWnd
                  ' If it moves onto the help window, hide it:
                  frmHelp.Hide
               Case Else
                  ' Cursor is over the form or something else, so
                  ' change interval back to 1 sec delay:
                  DisplayHelp ""
                  Timer1.Interval = 1000
            End Select
