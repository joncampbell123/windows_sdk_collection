<PRE>  Windows, version 3.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
COMPRESS.EXE is a utility program used by the Visual Basic SetupWizard to
compress your files before you place them on distribution disks. Once the
SetupWizard has built your distribution disks, COMPRESS.EXE is not used
anymore. COMPRESS.EXE is not necessary for installing your application by
means of the distribution disks.
<P>
However, if you want to have your application use the COMPRESS.EXE utility
for its own purposes, you can distribute COMPRESS.EXE with your
application. This may be useful if, for example, you want to have your
application program archive (compress) data files that are not in use.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can expand files compressed with COMPRESS.EXE by using several methods,
including the following:

<UL><LI>The EXPAND.EXE utility, also provided with the Visual Basic Setup Kit.
   (This utility is also redistributable.)

<LI>LZEXPAND.DLL API calls, which are documented in the Windows SDK Help
   file. LZEXPAND.DLL is provided with Windows version 3.1.
