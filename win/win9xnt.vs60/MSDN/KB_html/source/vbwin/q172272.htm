<P>
This sample illustrates how to manipulate nodes with the TreeView control.
It also illustrates how to save the node information to an Access database,
and then restore them. Additionally, this sample implements the drag-and-
drop feature for TreeView control nodes.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The purpose of this TreeView sample is to demonstrate the basics of using
and manipulating the TreeView control. This example shows how to add Nodes
using the five different relationship settings of the Nodes Collection Add
Method. It will also allow you to remove a selected Node or branch.
<P>
The main focus of the example is to show how to save and restore the Nodes
into an Access Database. The algorithm that you use saves the Nodes in
viewing order. This allows you to save and restore the TreeView control
with the Nodes in the same order as they appeared to the user when the user
closed the application.
<P>
The sample also shows how to drag and drop Nodes. You can also drag and
drop a Node on top of a different Node so that the dragged Node is now the
child of the Node it was dropped on.
<P>
For more information on the TreeView control please see Help or page 453 of
the Professional Features Custom Control Reference.
<P>
To use this sample, open Treeview.vbp in the VB IDE and press the F5 key or
choose Start from the Run menu.
