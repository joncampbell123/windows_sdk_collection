<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft engineers have developed a number of code samples that we are
providing as is for you, our customers, to help you learn more about Visual
Basic programming. These code samples were developed internally within
Microsoft to demonstrate various Visual Basic version 3.0 programming
techniques. These samples are not meant to be complete applications; they
are for illustration purposes only. We make no warranty, implied or
otherwise, regarding the performance, usability, or reliability of these
code samples.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can obtain the code samples from the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN)
compact disk (CD) by subscribing to MSDN. Or you can obtain them by
downloading them from the Microsoft Software Library (MSL) the Internet.
