The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Standard, Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual
   Basic for Windows, 16-bit and 32-bit, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The SaveSetting statement and GetSetting function in Visual Basic 4.0 for
Windows are used to create and retrieve information from nested levels in
the Registry. However, the related DeleteSetting statement does not handle
these nested settings. The GetAllSettings function also has this
limitation.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Error 5 - Invalid Procedure Call appears when the DeleteSetting is
attempted.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design. The ability to create and retrieve values from
nested levels in the registry was a fortunate byproduct of the design of
the set and get functions, and this wasn't extended to include all of the
related registry functions.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use more than one DeleteSetting statement to remove sections of the nested
keys before removing the top level key, rather than attempting to remove
the top key in isolation.
<P>
For example, in the following, do not use:
<P>
<PRE>   DeleteSetting "Test1"

</PRE>Instead, use the following two lines of code to remove the Test1 key and
its subkeys:
<P>
<PRE>   DeleteSetting "Test1\Test2"
   DeleteSetting "Test1"

</PRE>To enable all possible functionality, you can use the Registry API
functions to perform any desired operation manually.
<P>
For more information on the Registry API functions, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to reproduce problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic 4.0, 32-bit version. Form1 is created by default.
   Place two command buttons on the form. Add the following code to Form1:
<P>
<PRE>   Private Sub Command1_Click()
       SaveSetting "Test1", "Test2\Test3", "TestKey", "TestValue"
   End Sub

   Private Sub Command2_Click()
       DeleteSetting "Test1"
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>On the Run menu, choose Start, or press F5 to begin the application.
   Choose Command1 to add the nested keys to the registry. Open the
   Registry Editor and confirm that the information has been correctly
   added under the key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\VB and VBA Program
   Settings.

<P><LI>Return to the running application and choose Command2. VB will raise
   error 5 - Invalid Procedure Call. To view the workaround, stop the
   program and replace the single call to DeleteSetting with the two calls
   listed in the Workaround section above. Rerun the program and choose the
   second command button again. Use the Registry Editor to see that the
   keys have been removed correctly.
