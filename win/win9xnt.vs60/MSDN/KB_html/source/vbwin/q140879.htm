The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Professional and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic,
<PRE>  16-bit only, for Windows, version 4.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The SOUND statement found in Microsoft QuickBasic is not implemented
within Microsoft Visual Basic. You can perform sound through a Windows
API call that is equivalent to the QuickBasic SOUND statement.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The QuickBasic version of the SOUND statement can be executed by
calling several Windows 3.0 API function calls. Within Windows, you
must open up a VoiceQueue with the OpenSound call routine. Using the
function SetVoiceSound, place all of the values corresponding to the
desired frequencies and durations. Once the VoiceQueue has the desired
frequencies and durations, you start the process by calling
StartSound. After the sounds have been played, you must free up the
VoiceQueue by calling CloseSound. If you plan on placing a large
amount of information into the VoiceQueue, you may need to resize the
VoiceQueue buffer by calling the SetVoiceQueueSize function.
<P>
After executing the StartSound function, you cannot place any more
sound into the VoiceQueue until the VoiceQueue is depleted. Placing
more sound into the queue will overwrite any information that was
previously in the VoiceQueue. If you are going to place sound into the
VoiceQueue after a StartSound statement, you will need to call
WaitSoundState with an argument of one. When WaitSoundState returns
NULL, the VoiceQueue is empty and processing can continue.
<P>
Below is an example of using the Windows API function calls, which will
imitate the QuickBasic SOUND statement:
<P>
In the general section place the following:
<P>
Public Declare Function OpenSound Lib "sound.drv" () As Integer
Public Declare Function VoiceQueueSize Lib "sound.drv"
<PRE>            (ByVal nVoice%, ByVal nBytes%) As Integer
</PRE>Public Declare Function SetVoiceSound Lib "sound.drv"
<PRE>            (ByVal nSource%, ByVal Freq&amp;, ByVal nDuration%) As Integer
</PRE>Public Declare Function StartSound Lib "sound.drv" () As Integer
Public Declare Function CloseSound Lib "sound.drv" () As Integer
Public Declare Function WaitSoundState Lib "sound.drv" (ByVal State%)
As Integer
<P>
NOTE: All Declare statements above each must be placed on one line.
<P>
The SetVoiceSound takes two arguments. The first variable, Freq, is a
two WORD parameter. The HIGH WORD will hold the actual frequency in
hertz. The LOW WORD will hold the fractional frequency. The formula, X
* 2 ^ 16, will shift the variable "X" into the HIGH WORD location. The
second variable, Duration%, is the duration in clock ticks. There are
18.2 tick clicks per second on all Intel computers.
<P>
The following simplistic example shows how you can place several
frequencies and durations into the VoiceQueue before starting the
sound by calling the StartSound function:
<P>
<PRE>Private Sub Form_Click ()
   Suc% = OpenSound()
   S% = SetVoiceSound(1, 100 * 2 ^ 16, 100)   ' Frequency = 100 hz
   S% = SetVoiceSound(1, 90 * 2 ^ 16, 90)     ' Frequency = 90 hz
   S% = SetVoiceSound(1, 80 * 2 ^ 16, 90)     ' Frequency = 80 hz
   S% = StartSound()
   While (WaitSoundState(1) &lt;&gt; 0): Wend       ' Wait for sound to play.
   Succ% = CloseSound()
End Sub

</PRE>The following is another simple example, which creates a siren sound:

<OL><P><LI>Within the general section, place the following Sound procedure:
<P>
</OL>Public Sub Sound (ByVal Freq as Long, ByVal Duration%)
<PRE>   Freq = Freq * 2 ^ 16                 ' Shift frequency to high byte.
   S% = SetVoiceSound(1, Freq, Duration%)
   S% = StartSound()
   While (WaitSoundState(1) &lt;&gt; 0): Wend
End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Place the code below into any event procedure. The example below
   uses the Form_Click event procedure. Clicking any position on the
   form will create a police siren.
<P>
<PRE>Private Sub Form_Click ()
   Suc% = OpenSound()
   For j&amp; = 440 To 1000 Step 5
      Call Sound(j&amp;, j&amp; / 100)
   Next j&amp;
   For j&amp; = 1000 To 440 Step -5
      Call Sound(j&amp;, j&amp; / 100)
   Next j&amp;
   Succ% = CloseSound()
End Sub
