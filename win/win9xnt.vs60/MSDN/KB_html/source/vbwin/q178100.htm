Inside VB - As you build apps in VB5, the VB engine works hard behind the
scenes on your behalf. This article sheds light on mysterious concepts such
as p-code, compiler, and multi-threading. By Lee The, page 18.

Look Under VB'S Hood for Better Performance - One of VB's greatest
strengths is that it allows you to code complex tasks from a high level.

<P>
Optimize the Compiler for Speed - How would you like your app: fast and
safe, or recklessly fast? Before you answer, examine VB5's many compiler
settings, their effectiveness, and what you must do to maintain safe
applications. By Ward Hitt, page 40

Access Method (ISAM) driver to import ASCII files without Access.

Benchmarks Show VB5 Picks up Speed - VB5 is the fastest VB yet, according
to benchmark results we published in our May 1997 issue. Running the tests
