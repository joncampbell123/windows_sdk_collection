</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Following are the steps required to certify your Visual Basic for Windows
application with the Microsoft Windows Logo Program.

<OL><P><LI>Obtain and sign the following license agreements and submit them on
   paper along with your product for testing:
<P>
   - The Microsoft Windows NT and Windows 95 Logo license, available by
<P><PRE>     phone/fax service at (425) 635-2222, document #830.
</PRE>   - VeriTest's testing agreement, available by phone/fax service at
<P><PRE>     (425) 635-2222, document #831.
</PRE>
<P><LI>The online VeriTest Vendor Questionnaire must be completely filled out.
   The Vendor Questionnaire can be found on the VeriTest Web site at
   <B><A href="http://www.veritest.com/microsoft.htm">http://www.veritest.com/microsoft.htm.</A></B> The more information you provide
   in the Vendor Questionnaire the better. You must list exceptions and
   requests for exemptions here. By filling out the Vendor Questionnaire
   accurately and completely you will ensure that your product is tested in
   the shortest amount of time possible. After filling out the
   Questionnaire, click Submit and you will receive a Tracking Number from
   VeriTest. We recommend that you write the tracking number on your
   product disk when you send it in for testing (see the next step).

<P><LI>Submit your product to VeriTest. Your submission packet must include the
   following:
<P>
   - Your software product (on floppy disk, or CD-ROM).
   - The results of a pretest that you have run on your product using the
<P><PRE>     Installation Analyzer found at:
<PRE></PRE>        <B><A href="http://www.veritest.com/installation_analyzer.htm">http://www.veritest.com/installation_analyzer.htm</A></B>
     For more information about this requirement, refer to section 4.2.3 of
     the Logo Requirements.
   - The VeriTest Testing Agreement (submit on paper—-please see above).
   - The Windows NT and Windows 95 Logo License Agreement (submit on
     paper—-please see above).

     License Agreement:
     Your signature on these contracts does not mean that you can start
     using the Designed for Windows NT and Windows 95 Logo. It means that
     you have agreed to the license terms and are awaiting your product's
     passage of the tests and Microsoft's signing of the license.

     Confidentiality Option:
     On the Testing Agreement with VeriTest, you are given the option to
     keep your testing and test results confidential from Microsoft. If you
     choose this option, upon passing you must sign a release allowing
     VeriTest to send the results to Microsoft. Only after you sign this
     release can Microsoft grant you license to use the Logo.

</PRE><P><LI>You will receive test results from VeriTest within eight business days
   from the date when your complete application package was received.
   VeriTest will send both you and Microsoft a copy of the test results.

<P><LI>If your product passes testing, VeriTest will then send Microsoft the
   license agreement that you previously signed and submitted with your
   product testing to VeriTest.

<P><LI>Please read the Windows and Windows NT trademark guidelines (available
   at <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/thirdparty/winlogo/">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/thirdparty/winlogo/)</A></B> before using
   the Logo.

<P><LI>Please see <B><A href="http://www.veritest.com/microsoft.htm">http://www.veritest.com/microsoft.htm</A></B> for the current fee
   schedule. All testing fees are paid to VeriTest, not Microsoft.

<P><LI>If your product box is printed before you obtain the license to use the
   Designed for Windows NT and Windows 95 Logo, you may order the Logo
   sticker from Special Effects, Seattle, WA (an outside vendor) at
   specialeffex@msn.com. The stickers will be delivered when you receive
   the license to use the Logo.

<P><LI>Microsoft will sign the license agreement and send it to the person
   designated as the marketing contact in the Vendor Questionnaire that you
   submitted. At this point, you may download an electronic copy of the
   Logo artwork kit from a secure web server using the password provided to
   you by VeriTest. This contains electronic copies of the Logo and Logo
   usage guidelines.

<P><LI>If your company already has product(s) licensed to use the Designed for
   Windows NT and Windows 95 Logo, Microsoft will send you an update to
   the license after we receive your positive test results. This update
   will reflect the addition of the new product(s) to the license. Your
   signature on this update is required in order to complete the process.

<P><LI>The license allows you to use the Logo on packaging, advertising, your
   Web site, and other promotional materials.
