The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for
<PRE>  Windows, versions 2.0 and 3.0
</PRE>- Microsoft Professional Toolkit for Microsoft Visual Basic programming
<PRE>  system for Windows, version 1.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If you distribute the source code (.FRM) of a program that uses a
custom control, you must also distribute the necessary custom control
files for that control (.VBX, .DLL, and/or .EXE support files).
<P>
If a user has not purchased the Professional Edition of Microsoft
Visual Basic versions 2.0 or 3.0 for Windows, or the Microsoft
Professional Toolkit for Microsoft Visual Basic programming system
version 1.0 for Windows, and the user receives a program containing an
.FRM file written with the Professional Edition or Professional Toolkit,
then the Visual Basic for Windows programming environment (VB.EXE) will
not be able to load the program, and will display the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>    License file for custom control not found. You do not have
    an appropriate license to use this custom control in the
    design environment.

</PRE>NOTE: Anyone who acquires a program in the form of an executable
(.EXE) file that uses the custom controls from versions 2.0 or 3.0 of
the Professional Edition of Visual Basic for Windows, or from version
1.0 of the Professional Toolkit for Visual Basic for Windows, will be
able to run that program with no error.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The licensing file, VB.LIC is installed by the SETUP.EXE program
included in the Professional Edition of Visual Basic for Windows, or
the SETUP.EXE included in the Visual Basic for Windows Professional
Toolkit. This licensing file is installed into the Windows' \SYSTEM
subdirectory. You are NOT allowed to distribute this file with any
application that you develop and distribute.
<P>
A custom control's startup code checks to see if this VB.LIC licensing
file exists when the control is loaded into the environment. If the
file does not exist, or is corrupt, the control aborts the loading
process and displays the following Alter message box:
<P>
<PRE>   License file for custom control not found. You do not have
   an appropriate license to use this custom control in the
   design environment.
