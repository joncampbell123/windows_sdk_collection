<P>
- Professional and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic,
<PRE>  16-bit only, for Windows, version 4.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is introducing OLE Custom Controls that combine the benefits of
Visual Basic programming system custom controls (.VBX files) with the open
standard of Object Linking and Embedding (OLE).
<P>
Microsoft also plans to offer a Control Developer's Kit (CDK) to make it
easier to add OLE capabilities to existing .VBX custom controls, thus
facilitating component-based software development for Windows-based
applications. This article describes this new technology and explains the
implications for users as well as control developers.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft's comprehensive object strategy is built around the OLE object
model and is designed to provide developers with a consistent and open
standard for defining what an object is and how objects interact with one
another.
<P>
<P><h3>Benefits Associated with Microsoft OLE Custom Control Architecture</h3>
 

<UL><LI>OLE technology is now an integral part of custom controls, creating
   a new open standard for component-based software development.

<LI>You will have the ability to create either 16-bit or 32-bit custom
   controls that have all the power of OLE 2.0 functions and services,
   including Visual Editing, Drag and Drop, and OLE Automation.

<LI>OLE Custom Controls have a broader base of usability, because they
   are not limited to being used with Visual Basic as .VBX custom
   controls are. OLE Custom Controls can be loaded by any container
   that supports OLE 2.0.

<LI>Both 16-bit and 32-bit components can be developed using the same OLE
   Custom Control source code under Microsoft Windows, Microsoft
   Windows NT, and future versions of the Windows operating system and
   eventually other platforms as well.

<LI>Control wizards in the OLE CDK enable developers to easily build OLE
   Custom Controls using the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) and
   allow developers to migrate existing .VBX custom controls to the
   OLE Custom Control architecture.
<P>
</UL><h3>Contents and Availability of OLE CDK</h3>
 
<P>
The OLE CDK includes:

<UL><LI>16-bit and 32-bit extensions to MFC version 2.5 to support controls.

<LI>ControlWizard for creating an initial OLE Custom Control project or
   porting an existing .VBX control to the new architecture.

<LI>ClassWizard extended to support OLE Custom Controls.

<LI>Test Container for verifying OLE Custom Controls.

<LI>Complete online documentation.

<LI>Samples of OLE Custom Controls with source code.
<P>
</UL>The OLE CDK is available:

<UL><LI>As an add-on product to Microsoft Visual C++ version 1.5, for creating
   16-bit controls.

<LI>As an add-on product to the next version of Microsoft Visual C++ for
   creating 32-bit controls.
<P>
</UL>In addition, support for OLE Custom Controls will be included in future
versions of Microsoft development tool products and Microsoft Visual Basic,
Applications Edition, bringing OLE Custom Control capabilities to the
family of Microsoft Office business productivity programs.
<P>
<P><h3>Future of .VBX Custom Controls</h3>
 
<P>
To preserve existing customer code bases that use Visual Basic custom
controls, Microsoft will continue to support the current .VBX custom
control architecture with 16-bit versions of Visual Basic and Visual C++.
For 32-bit development, OLE Custom Controls will be the extensibility
mechanism of choice.
<P>
By merging the benefits of OLE 2.0 with the existing .VBX architecture,
Microsoft is offering independent software vendors and customers an open,
standard way to realize all the benefits of component-based software
development. For example, users will be able to plug different OLE Custom
Controls into a database or spreadsheet application to provide a range of
custom functions such as specialized financial modules, equation editing,
scientific analysis, run-time tutorials and charting. In the past, the
primary benefits of object-oriented programming were directed at
programmers; OLE brings the benefits of object technology to a broader
audience, including end users, developers and system integrators.
<P>
<P><h3>Questions &amp; Answers</h3>
 
<P>
Q: Can I use OLE controls from other products such as Microsoft Access
<PRE>   version 2.0 for Windows in my Visual Basic version 4.0 program?

</PRE>A: Yes. Because OLE custom controls are actually OLE 2.0 servers, they
<PRE>   can be embedded in any OLE 2.0-compliant application, including
   existing released versions of Microsoft Excel for Windows, Visual Basic
   version 4.0 (using the OLE 2.0 container control), and many third-party
   applications as well.

   However, Microsoft Excel developers do not have access to OLE custom
   controls Windows events such as mouse clicks. Microsoft Access version
   2.0 supports OLE custom controls fully, including events.

   The Microsoft Access Developers Kit (ADT) version 2.0 ships with
   several OLE custom controls: the calendar, scroll bar, and the Data View
   control. The calendar and scroll bar can be embedded in any OLE 2.0
   application, including a Visual Basic version 3.0 application, but the
   Data View control cannot be embedded because it is designed to run only
   with Microsoft Access.

</PRE>Q. How does licensing work with OLE custom controls?
<P>
A: Most OLE custom controls, like the calendar and scroll bar in the ADT,
<PRE>   work like .VBX controls. If the Data View custom control is used in a
   Microsoft Access application, the end user must have a copy of
   Microsoft Access installed on their computer. The OLE custom control
   architecture allows for a lot of flexibility, so it is up to the
   control creator to define the licensing restrictions for his or her
   control. We expect most third-party OLE custom controls will have
   licensing restrictions to the same extent as .VBX controls do today.

</PRE>Q: Do I need to make modifications to my source code to run in the next
<PRE>   version of Visual Basic?

</PRE>A: No. The next version of Visual Basic will be backwards compatible with
<PRE>   existing .VBX controls so that no modifications are necessary.
   Third-party OLE controls that replace the .VBX controls will also be
   backwards compatible. Check with the third-party supplier of your
   existing .VBX controls about their plans for releasing OLE custom
   control upgrades.

</PRE>Q: Is it true that .VBX custom controls are not going to be supported in
<PRE>   the next version of Visual Basic?

</PRE>A: No. The .VBX custom controls will still be supported in the next
<PRE>   version of both Visual Basic and Visual C++ (16-bit version). However,
   all new 16-bit and 32-bit custom control development in the future will
   be through the OLE Custom Control Development Kit.

</PRE>Q: What tools is Microsoft providing to help me port my .VBX control to
<PRE>   OLE or to create OLE custom controls from scratch?

</PRE>A: The new Control Development Kit (CDK) includes wizards, a VBX porting
<PRE>   tool, and documentation that specifically addresses porting a .VBX
   control to the new architecture. We have found that getting a
   preliminary working OLE custom control up and running can be
   accomplished in a very short period of time. The Control Wizard, which
   is part of the CDK, provides stock properties and events and creates a
   working shell control from which the developer can customize and add
   their own control-specific code and features.

</PRE>Q: Is Microsoft offering a porting lab to help customers port VBX to OLE?
<P>
A: We are already working closely with the VBX ISV community, and our
<PRE>   preliminary experience with porting these controls has shown that a
   porting lab will probably not be necessary because the process is not
   difficult. As we move forward, we will continue to monitor third-party
   porting efforts, and we will assist them in every way we can.

</PRE>Q: Is there any proof (benchmarks) on actual OLE custom controls that
<PRE>   they can be fast enough for use as components in shipping products?
   How can my controls be as fast via OLE as they are via VBX?

</PRE>A: A major design goal for the OLE custom controls architecture is high
<PRE>   performance and small footprint. We have done some preliminary tests
   that show that OLE custom controls can, in some cases, be faster than
   .VBX controls.

</PRE>Q: What will this do to my business? I built a strong franchise around
<PRE>   .VBX controls.

</PRE>A: Microsoft will continue to support .VBX controls under 16-bit in the
<PRE>   next revisions of Visual Basic and Visual C++, concurrent with support
   for the OLE custom control architecture. We will continue to work with
   control vendors to help them evolve from today's VBX standard to the
   new OLE custom control standard for both 16-bit and 32-bit Windows
   platforms. OLE custom controls offer new choices and greater
   flexibility for customers, ultimately resulting in reduced development
   time and decreased costs.

</PRE>Q: Why not support .VBX controls on 32-bit for backward compatibility,
<PRE>   and support OLE too?

</PRE>A: OLE is Microsoft's strategic direction for component-based software
<PRE>   development. OLE is a standard that is supported widely in the
   software industry. Merging the benefits of OLE with the benefits of
   .VBX custom controls will bring the best of both approaches together
   in one, standard architecture. While .VBX custom controls have helped
   make Visual Basic successful, they use a proprietary technology that
   is tied to the 16-bit Windows architecture.

</PRE>Q: What is the relationship between future Microsoft operating systems
<PRE>   and OLE custom controls?

</PRE>A: OLE custom controls are an integral part of our future operating
<PRE>   systems. Much of our future operating system user interface will be
   based on OLE custom controls.

</PRE>Q: How many files and how big will the files be that I and my customers
<PRE>   must ship to build applications that use my OLE custom controls?

</PRE>A: The controls and the architecture itself are still in development,
<PRE>   so it is too early to know exactly how big or how small the controls
   will be. The maximum number of files a control developer must ship
   with their application is two files -- one file for the control, the
   second file for a control run-time DLL, which is shared across by
   all OLE custom controls on the system. The standard OLE operating
   system .DLL files must also reside on the computer. The whole concept
   behind OLE and component development is to minimize the amount of
   code on both the developer's and user's desktop, so you can be sure
   that we are working to minimize the size of the files required for
   OLE custom controls, as well as to maximize control performance.

</PRE>Q: Can I maintain a single source code tree for both 16-bit and 32-bit
<PRE>   controls?

</PRE>A: Yes. If you use the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), one
<PRE>   source-tree can be compiled to create a 16-bit or 32-bit OLE custom
   control.

</PRE>Q: Do I have to use Microsoft Visual C++, the Control Development Kit,
<PRE>   and the Microsoft Foundation classes to create OLE custom controls?

</PRE>A: No, but these tools make it much easier for developers to create OLE
<PRE>   custom controls.

</PRE>Q: Some developers familiar with OLE have suggested that the overhead in
<PRE>   code is burdensome for a simple VBX-like object such as a push-button.

</PRE>A: You will be surprised how little the overhead is with OLE custom
<PRE>   controls. OLE custom controls even allow you to include multiple OLE
   custom controls in a single file, distributing the already minimal
   overhead across multiple controls. This minimal overhead is a
   worthwhile tradeoff, particularly for developers who want to take full
   advantage of the portability that OLE provides. And developers who
   will be working in 32-bit environments will want to get as much lead
   time as possible to work with OLE custom controls, as it is the
   control model we are supporting in 32-bit mode in all future versions
   of our development tools.

</PRE>Q: How can I be sure that OLE is the model I should be building my
<PRE>   software around? The VBX model has been such a success. How can I be
   sure of the success of OLE?

</PRE>A: OLE is Microsoft's strategic component object model. We have been
<PRE>   promoting OLE for the past 18 months. OLE is not new. It's no secret
   in the industry that OLE is Microsoft's stated future direction. In
   the past year, Microsoft has sponsored conferences and seminars that
   have focused, in part or in total, on what OLE is, why it is important,
   and how to work with it now and in the future.

   Microsoft is not the only company endorsing and promoting OLE as an
   industry standard for component-based software development. There will
   be over 150 non-Microsoft OLE-compliant applications shipping by
   Spring COMDEX 1994. 25,000 copies of Kraig Brockschmidt's book,
   "Inside OLE 2.0" have been sold. And there are 8,000 developers
   currently doing OLE development work.

   Microsoft and our ISV community have made .VBX controls an industry
   success story. We plan to build on that success by merging the
   benefits of OLE with the benefits of .VBX custom controls to bring the
   best of both approaches together in one, universal custom control
   architecture.

   Naturally, Microsoft will continue to support .VBX controls under 16
   bits in the next revision of Visual Basic, concurrent with support for
   the OLE custom control architecture. We will continue to work with
   control vendors to help them evolve from today's VBX standard to the
   new OLE custom control standard for both 16-bit and 32-bit Window
   platforms.
