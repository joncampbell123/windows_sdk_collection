The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for
<PRE>  Windows, versions 2.0 and 3.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
You can use the Windows API function Lstrcpy() to get the far address of
a variable as a Long integer.
<P>
The Lstrcpy() function returns the same value as its first argument, which
is the address of a variable. Usually you would use the Lstrcpy() function
to copy strings that are terminated by a zero byte. However, if you pass
the same variable as both the source and the destination, Lstrcpy() copies
the variable to itself, which has no effect.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Basic cannot deal with pointers directly. All Basic can do with a pointer
is pass it as a parameter to a DLL function.
<P>
Basic variables may move in memory. You should take the address of a
variable immediately before you use it.
<P>
The following steps demonstrate how to get the address of an integer and a
variable-length string.

<OL><P><LI>Run Visual Basic, or from the File menu, choose New Project (ALT, F, N)
   if Visual Basic is already running. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Enter the following code into the general declarations section:
<P>
<PRE>   Declare Function Lstrcpy Lib "kernel" (p1 As Any, p2 As Any) As Long

</PRE><P><LI>Enter the following code into the Click event handler:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Form_Click ()
      Dim ptr As Long     ' pointer value
      Dim x1 As Integer   ' variable to take address of
      Dim x2 As String    ' variable to take address of
      x1 = 123
      ptr = Lstrcpy(x1, x1)
      MsgBox "The address of x1 is: " + Hex$(ptr)
      x2 = "x2"
      ' must use ByVal on variable length strings
      ptr = Lstrcpy(ByVal x2, ByVal x2)
      MsgBox "The address of x2 is: " + Hex$(ptr)
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Press the F5 key to run the program. It displays the address of the
   variable in hexadecimal.
