The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Learning, Professional, and Enterprise Editions
   for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The index view in Books Online provides a search field you can use to find
a topic. Books Online scrolls to the appropriate section in the index list
when you quickly type the letters for a desired topic into the search
field. However, if you type slowly into the search field, Books Online
scrolls to a section in the index list, but only for the text displayed in
the search field. If you continue to type slowly, the index list scrolls to
a different section for each of the letters you type and these letters are
never displayed in the search field.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Typing slowly into the search field yields control to the Books Online
program and focus is shifted from the search field. Books Online scrolls to
the section in the index list for the text already in the search field but
focus is not returned. If you continue typing slowly, this loss of focus on
the search field causes each letter to be interpreted separately and the
index list to scroll to a different section for each one. The text in the
search field is also not updated correctly for the same reason.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The workarounds are:

<UL><LI>to type the letters of the desired topic into the search field as
   quickly as possible without any pauses,
<P>
 -or-

<LI>to paste the string you are searching for into the search field.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open Books Online. "Books Online..." appears under the Help menu.

<P><LI>Switch to the Index by clicking the Index toolbar button or selecting
   "Index" under the View menu.

<P><LI>Set focus to the search field by clicking the search field with the
   mouse. The search field is above the index list.

<P><LI>Press the “s” key and wait for the index list to scroll to the “S”
   section.

<P><LI>Press the “c” key.
<P>
</OL>At this point, you would normally expect to see “sc” in the search field
and the "SC" section in the index list. Because the focus did not return to
the search field, the “c” key press causes the index list to jump to the
“C” section of the index list instead of the desired “SC” section.
