<PRE>  Windows, version 3.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Many applications use a status bar to display the progress of an
installation or other lengthy process. Often the percent completed is
printed in the middle of the bar and it changes color as the status bar
passes over it. This article illustrates how to achieve this effect using
Visual Basic for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The simplest way to specify the range of the status bar is to determine
what the zero-based range will be and specify that value as the ScaleWidth
of the horizontal scroll bar. Then you don't have to scale the data for
each new sample.
<P>
Changing the color of the percentage displayed within the picture box is
done by specifying the DrawMode as Not XOR Pen with a compatible
background. When the bar is drawn, an exclusive OR is performed on each
pixel. If the pixel is red, it is made white and vice versa. The text must
be placed first because Print does not support DrawMode.
<P>
The following program demonstrates how to display a red status bar with a
red or white text message centered in it. Colors other than red are
specified by changing the ForeColor property of the Picture Box Control.
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add a picture box (Picture1) and a command button (Command1) to the
   form.

<P><LI>Add the following code to the Form_Load event:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Form_Load()
      Picture1.AutoRedraw = True
      Picture1.BackColor  = &amp;H80000003&amp;
      Picture1.DrawMode   = 10
      Picture1.FillStyle  = 0
      Picture1.ForeColor  = &amp;H00000080
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following code to the general declarations section of Form1:
<P>
   Dim tenth as Long
<P>
<PRE>   ' Enter the following Declare statement as one, single line:
   Declare Function BitBlt Lib "GDI" (ByVal hDestDC As Integer,
      ByVal X As Integer, ByVal Y As Integer, ByVal nWidth As Integer,
      ByVal nHeight As Integer, ByVal hSrcDC As Integer,
      ByVal XSrc As Integer, ByVal YSrc As Integer, ByVal dwRop As Long)
      As Integer

   Sub UpdateStatus (FileBytes As Long)

      '--------------------------------------------------------------------
      ' Update the Picture1 status bar
      '--------------------------------------------------------------------
       Static progress as long
       Const SRCCOPY = &amp;HCC0020
       Dim Txt$

       progress = progress + FileBytes
       If progress &gt; Picture1.ScaleWidth Then
          progress = Picture1.ScaleWidth
       End If
       Txt$ = Format$(CLng((progress / Picture1.ScaleWidth) * 100)) + "%"
       Picture1.Cls

       ' Enter the following two lines as one, single line of code:
       Picture1.CurrentX =
          (Picture1.ScaleWidth - Picture1.TextWidth(Txt$)) \ 2

       ' Enter the following two lines as one, single line of code:
       Picture1.CurrentY =
          (Picture1.ScaleHeight - Picture1.TextHeight(Txt$)) \ 2

       Picture1.Print Txt$

       ' Enter the following two lines as one, single line of code:
       Picture1.Line (0,0)-(progress,Picture1.ScaleHeight),
          Picture1.ForeColor,BF

       ' Enter the following two lines as one, single line of code:
       r = BitBlt(Picture1.hDC, 0, 0,Picture1.ScaleWidth,
          Picture1.ScaleHeight, Picture1.hDC, 0, 0, SRCCOPY)

   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following code to Click event procedure of Command1:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Command1_Click ()
      Picture1.ScaleWidth = 109
      tenth = 10
      For i = 1 to 10
         Call UpdateStatus(tenth)
         x = timer
         While Timer &lt; x + .75
            doevents
         Wend
      Next
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Press the F5 key to run the program, and then click the Command1 button.
