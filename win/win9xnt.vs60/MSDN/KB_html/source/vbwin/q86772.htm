<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible to right justify top-level menu items by including a
CHR$(8) (backspace) as the first character of the caption for the
left-most menu that you want to appear on the right side of the menu
bar.
<P>
This article does not apply to Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft publishes a book called "The Windows Interface: An Application
Design Guide," which contains standards and guidelines for Windows 3.1. The
following guidelines for right-justified Help menu items is taken from that
book:
<P>
<PRE>   "Some applications currently place the Help menu at the extreme right of
   the menu bar. The current recommendation is that the Help menu
   immediately follow the next-to-last menu item, for three reasons: (1) to
   increase the accessibility of the help menu; (2) to decrease the
   likelihood of pressing the Maximize or Minimize buttons by mistake when
   trying to access Help; and (3) to make the space at the extreme right of
   the menu bar available in MDI applications for a Restore icon for
   maximized child windows."

</PRE><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic or from the File menu, choose New Project (ALT, F, N)
   if Visual Basic is already running. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>From the Window menu, choose Menu Design Window.

<P><LI>Create a menu item with One as both caption and control name.

<P><LI>Choose the Next button, and repeat step 3 with using Two as the name.

<P><LI>Choose Done to exit the Menu Design Window. You now have two
   top-level menus.

<P><LI>Add the following code to the Form1 Form_Load event procedure:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Form_Load ()
      Two.Caption = Chr$(8) + Two.Caption
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Press the F5 key to run the program.
<P>
</OL>The Two menu item appears on the right side of the menu bar. If you add the
backspace to the One menu caption, both menus will be right-justified.
<P>
<P><h3>Special Trick for Design Time</h3>
 
<P>
The technique given above can be done only at run time. However, here's a
trick you can use to do the same thing at design time:

<OL><P><LI>Make a text file with ASCII character 8 in it.

<P><LI>Load the text file into NOTEPAD.EXE and copy the character to the
   clipboard.

<P><LI>Then, when you're in the Menu Design window, Press SHIFT-INS (Paste) in
   the caption field to place CHR$(8) character in it.
<P></OL>
