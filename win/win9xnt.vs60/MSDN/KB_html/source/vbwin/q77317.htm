The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for
<PRE>  Windows, versions 2.0 and 3.0
</PRE>- Microsoft Visual Basic programming system for Windows, version 1.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows does not provide a command to
read or write an entire array all at once to a disk file. Using Visual
Basic for Windows alone, you must transfer each element of the array
to the disk. However, using two Windows API functions, _lread and
_lwrite, you can save an entire array to disk in one statement when
the array is less then 64K.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The ReadArray and WriteArray functions provided below allow you to
read and write a Visual Basic for Windows array to or from a disk file.
These functions will work with arrays of Integers, Longs, Singles,
Doubles, Currency, and user-defined types, but not with
variable-length strings (as an array or as a member of a user-defined
type) or variants. These functions can work with fixed length strings
when the strings are a member of a user-defined type. Arrays greater
than 64K are supported in Visual Basic versions 2.0 and later for
Windows, however the _lread and _lwrite functions can only handle
arrays up to 64K. Arrays greater than 64K can be written to disk using
the standard I/O statements built into Visual Basic for Windows.
<P>
The two functions, ReadArray and WriteArray, require two parameters:
the array to be transferred, and the Visual Basic for Windows file
number to be written to or read from. The functions also return the
number of bytes transferred, or -1 when an error occurs with the API
function. The file number is the Visual Basic for Windows file number
of a file that has already been opened with the Open statement, and
will be used in the Visual Basic for Windows Close statement.
<P>
The following function examples use a user-defined type named "Mytype".
An example of this type is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Type MyType
        Field1 As String * 10
        Field2 As Integer
        Field3 As Long
        Field4 As Single
        Field5 As Double
        Field6 As Currency
   End Type

</PRE><h3>Declarations of API Functions</h3>
 
<P>
DefInt A-Z
<PRE>' Each Declare statement must appear on one line:
Declare Function fWrite Lib "kernel" Alias "_lwrite" (ByVal hFile,
   lpBuff As Any, ByVal wBytes)
Declare Function fRead Lib "kernel" Alias "_lread" (ByVal hFile,
   lpBuff As Any, ByVal wBytes)

</PRE><h3>Function: ReadArray</h3>
 
<P>
Function ReadArray (An_Array() As MyType, VBFileNumber As Integer) As Long
<P>
<PRE>   Dim ApiErr As Integer
   Dim ArraySize As Long
   Dim DOSFileHandle As Integer
   Dim ReadFromDisk As Integer

   ArraySize = Abs(UBound(An_Array) - LBound(An_Array)) + 1
   ArraySize = ArraySize * Len(An_Array(LBound(An_Array)))

   If ArraySize &gt; 32767 Then
      ReadFromDisk = ArraySize - 2 ^ 15
      ReadFromDisk = ReadFromDisk * -1
   Else
      ReadFromDisk = ArraySize
   End If

   DOSFileHandle = FileAttr(VBFileNumber, 2)
   ApiErr=fRead(DOSFileHandle,An_Array(LBound(An_Array)),ReadFromDisk)

   ReadArray = ApiErr
</PRE>End Function
<P>
<P><h3>Function: WriteArray</h3>
 
<P>
Function WriteArray (An_Array() As MyType, VBFileNumber As Integer) As Long
<P>
<PRE>   Dim ApiErr As Integer
   Dim ArraySize As Long
   Dim DOSFileHandle As Integer
   Dim WriteToDisk As Integer

   ArraySize = UBound(An_Array) - LBound(An_Array) + 1
   ArraySize = ArraySize * Len(An_Array(LBound(An_Array)))

   If ArraySize &gt; 32767 Then
      WriteToDisk = ArraySize - 2 ^ 15
      WriteToDisk = WriteToDisk * -1
   Else
      WriteToDisk = ArraySize
   End If

   DOSFileHandle = FileAttr(VBFileNumber, 2)
   ApiErr=fWrite(DOSFileHandle,An_Array(LBound(An_Array)),WriteToDisk)

   WriteArray = ApiErr
</PRE>End Function
<P>
The following are the function header changes to allow the ReadArray
and WriteArray functions to work with different data types (Integer,
Long, Single, Double, Currency, and user-defined type). Each Function
statement must be on a single line:
<P>
Function ReadArray  (An_Array() As Integer, VBFileNumber As Integer)
<PRE>   As Long
</PRE>Function WriteArray (An_Array() As Integer, VBFileNumber As Integer)
<PRE>   As Long

</PRE>Function ReadArray  (An_Array() As Long, VBFileNumber As Integer) As
<PRE>   Long
</PRE>Function WriteArray (An_Array() As Long, VBFileNumber As Integer) As
<PRE>   Long

</PRE>Function ReadArray  (An_Array() As Single, VBFileNumber As Integer) As
<PRE>   Long
</PRE>Function WriteArray (An_Array() As Single, VBFileNumber As Integer) As
<PRE>   Long

</PRE>Function ReadArray  (An_Array() As Double, VBFileNumber As Integer) As
<PRE>   Long
</PRE>Function WriteArray (An_Array() As Double, VBFileNumber As Integer) As
<PRE>   Long

</PRE>Function ReadArray  (An_Array() As Currency, VBFileNumber As Integer)
<PRE>   As Long
</PRE>Function WriteArray (An_Array() As Currency, VBFileNumber As Integer)
<PRE>   As Long
