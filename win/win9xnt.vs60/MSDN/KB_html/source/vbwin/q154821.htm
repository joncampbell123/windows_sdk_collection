The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Professional and Enterprise Editions for
   Windows, version 5.0
<LI>Standard, Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual
   Basic, 32-bit only, for Windows, version 4.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Windows NT and Windows 95 store additional information about a file,
including the time and date that the file was last accessed. This
information cannot be accessed with the FileDateTime API function but can
be extracted using a combination of calls to the Windows API. This article
describes how to accomplish this behavior.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The creation time, last-written time, and the last-accessed (read) time of
a file are all stored in 32-bit Windows, but only the time and date of the
last write to the file are accessible directly from Visual Basic.
<P>
The API function used expects to be passed a system file handle rather than
a Visual Basic file number. However, due to a limitation in 32-bit Visual
Basic, the FileAttr function is incapable of returning an operating system
file handle and API calls must be used to open the file. To obtain this
data, do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Start a new Visual Basic project. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add a text box control to Form1. It is called Text1 by default.

<P><LI>Add a CommandButton to Form1. It is called Command1 by default

<P><LI>Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1:
<P>
   Option Explicit
<P>
   Private Const OF_READ = &amp;H0
   Private Const OF_SHARE_DENY_NONE = &amp;H40
   Private Const OFS_MAXPATHNAME = 128

</PRE>   End Type

       MsgBox "GetFileTime Failed"

</PRE><P><LI>Run the program by pressing the F5 key or clicking the Play button.
   Enter a filename in the text box, including path if necessary, and
   click the CommandButton.
<P>
</OL>Note that the last written time and file creation time are returned.
The code could be extended to return the Time information as well as the
Date information shown. These values are returned in the SYSTEMTIME record.
<P>
The FAT and New Technology file systems support the file creation, last
access, and last write time values. Under Windows 95, the precision of the
time for a file in a FAT file system is 2 seconds. The time precision
for files in other file systems, such as those connected through a network,
depends on the file system but may also be limited by the remote device.
