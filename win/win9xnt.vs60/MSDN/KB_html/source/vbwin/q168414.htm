The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation, Learning, Professional, and
   Enterprise Editions for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When compiling an ActiveX Server (EXE or DLL), you may get the following
error at the end of compiling:
<P>
<PRE>   "An unexpected error occurred during compiling or linking"

</PRE>If you choose to view the error details, the following message will be
displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   "LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file &lt;filename&gt;"

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the Binary Compatibility property is set for an ActiveX Server
component (.EXE or .DLL), Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0 leaves the compatible
source file in an open state until the Visual Basic 5.0 environment is
closed.
<P>
NOTE: The behavior can also surface randomly with other types of Visual
Basic projects when Binary Compatibility is used.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are a few workarounds to this behavior:

<UL><LI>When using the Binary Compatibility property, do not set the compatible
   source file to the same filename and location as the compiled
   component's destination file.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Use the Project Compatibility option or the No Compatibility option
   whenever possible.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Close and re-open the Microsoft Visual Basic environment when it is
   necessary to delete and/or overwrite the file which is locked in the
   open state.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this
bug and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0's development environment, the user has the
option to select the following compatible component options:

<UL><LI>No Compatibility
<LI>Project Compatibility
<LI>Binary Compatibility
<P>
</UL>This is done from the Component Tab of the Project Properties Dialog. The
set of options on the dialog box determines how the project is to be
compiled. (For more details on Compatibility, select the Component Tab and
then press the Help button on the dialog.)
<P>
Selecting Project Compatibility or Binary Compatibility enables the file
location textbox. The user can then select the source file for the
compatibility during the compile process.
<P>
During compilation of the project, Visual Basic opens the compatible source
file, reads specific information, and then writes the compiled compatible
file to the destination specified on the Make Project dialog.
<P>
If the user selects Binary Compatibility, Visual Basic does not close the
source file for an ActiveX EXE Server until Visual Basic itself is closed.
This is not the case for the Project Compatibility option, nor is it the
case for ActiveX Control projects.
<P>
The result of leaving the file open is not an issue for the user unless
the user selects the same filename and location for the destination file.
If they are the same, the user will encounter an error.
