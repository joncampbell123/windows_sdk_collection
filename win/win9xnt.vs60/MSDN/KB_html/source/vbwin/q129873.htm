<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes what property pages are and suggests diagnostics
for situations where a property page for a particular OLE control (.OCX
file) might not appear.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Property pages are the interface through which a control's properties may
be viewed and/or edited at design time. Each related set of properties
appears in its own property page. To see them, right-click the OCX at
design time, and choose Properties from the Context menu.
<P>
There are two kinds of property pages, Custom and Stock. Custom property
pages are those that need to be defined by you, the developer. Stock
property pages (like Colors, Pictures, and Fonts) are already supplied by
the control development kit (CDK).
<P>
Property pages are objects too. Each type of property page defines a new
OLE class and has a CLSID (class identifier) assigned to it. Thus, property
pages for OLE controls rely on the system registry. If a system registry
entry for a property page is missing for some reason, that property page is
no longer accessible. While this will not cause any errors, the property
page will always be invisible.
<P>
For custom property pages, this problem can be fixed by re-registering the
OCX. This can be done by choosing Custom Controls from the Tools menu,
browsing to find the control, and then selecting the appropriate .OCX file.
<P>
Standard property pages are provided by OC30.DLL for the 32-bit Visual
Basic and OC25.DLL for 16-bit Visual Basic. If the registry entries for
these DLLs are missing, then these property pages will be missing for all
controls that use them. To re-register these DLLs, reinstall Visual Basic
version 4.0.
