The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for
   Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you enter a duplicate value for a key field, you will notice different
behavior depending on whether the form is shown as modal or modeless. When
you have a modeless form and a duplicate value for a key field, the error
"Can't have duplicate key; index changes were unsuccessful" appears as you
try to move to the next record. When you have a modal form, this error
appears as you try to unload the form. In both cases, Visual Basic does not
save the duplicate data.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Visual Basic version 3.0
for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start a new project in Visual Basic 3.0. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add a second form to the project by clicking New Form on the Visual
   Basic File menu. Form2 is created by default.

<P><LI>Place two command buttons (Command1 and Command2) on the Form1.

<P><LI>Set the Caption property of Command1 to Modeless and set the Caption
   property of Command2 to Modal.

<P><LI>Place the following code in the Click event procedure for Command1:
<P>
   form2.Show
<P>
   Then place the following code in the Click event procedure for
   Command2:
<P>
   form2.Show 1

<P><LI>Place a text box (Text1) and a data control (Data1) on Form2.

<P><LI>Set the following properties for these controls:
<P>
   Text1
<PRE>      DataSource     Data1
      DataField      ISBN

   Data1
      DatabaseName   Biblio.mdb
      Recordsource   Titles

</PRE><P><LI>Run the program by clicking Start on the Run menu.

<P><LI>Click the Modeless button. This will show Form2 with the first record of
   the database. Select the text in the text box, and copy it by pressing
   CTRL+INS. Move to the next record, and select the new text in the text
   box. Paste the text from the previous record into the text box by
   pressing SHIFT+INS. On trying to move to a new record, you will
   receive this error message.
<P>
   Can't have duplicate key; index changes were unsuccessful.

<P><LI>Close Form2 by double-clicking its control box.

<P><LI>Click the Modal button on Form1. Form2 will appear again with the first
<P><PRE>    record of the database. Select the text in the text box, and copy it by
    pressing CTRL-INS. Move to the next record, and select the new text in
    the text box. Paste the text from the previous record into the text box
    by pressing SHIFT-INS. On trying to move to a new record, you will not
    receive an error message.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Close Form2 by double-clicking its control box. Now you will get the
<P><PRE>    error message:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    Can't have duplicate key; index changes were unsuccessful.
