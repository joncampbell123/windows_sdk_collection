The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Professional and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic,
   16-bit only, for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Choosing Make EXE and compiling an application into an executable
for the first time in an instance of the Integrated Development
Environment (IDE) results in an approximately 1.75 megabyte (MB) memory
leak. Subsequent compilations into an executable file result in
approximately 50K memory leaks. System resources are not affected. All
memory is regained once the Visual Basic IDE is shut down.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the 16-bit version of
Visual Basic 4.0 for Windows. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
On most systems, the memory leak should not affect system performance
until available memory results in Windows swapping to disk for additional
virtual memory. To work around this problem, close Visual Basic after
making an executable and restart Visual Basic to continue working on the
project.
<P>
The sample application VISDATA, found in the \samples\visdata directory,
produced the following results on an 8 MB machine with virtual memory
disabled. Free memory was determined by running a secondary application
which called the GetFreeSpace Windows API function.
