<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Visual Basic 4.0 has a Compile on Demand feature. To set it, on the Tools
menu, click Options, and then click Advanced. This feature is selected by
default. When this feature is selected, code segments are not forced to be
compiled until called upon in the application. This means that the
application will typically start more quickly, but there will be some delay
during the running of an application from the design environment if a code
segment is called that has not yet been compiled.
<P>
However, even with Compile On Demand set to True, Visual Basic still
compiles code during any idle time that the processor has - including time
in Debug mode and when the program has been stopped - if the Background
Compile option has been selected. Consequently, a program may run just as
fast with the Compile On Demand feature set to True as when it is set False
if there is plenty of idle time before any given code routine is called.
