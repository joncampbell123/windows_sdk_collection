<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using a Frame or a PictureBox as its container at run-time, a user-
created ActiveX control will move when its width or height is changed.
However, the problem does not occur when a Form is used as the container or
when the control is placed in the container at design-time.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
UserControl caches the window handle it was activated on. When the size is
changed, it tries to figure out its current coordinates within its parent
by getting its screen coordinates and then mapping them relative to its
parent's screen coordinates. Because its cached parent is no longer its
real parent, it calculates the wrong coordinates and moves the control to
those wrong coordinates.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio
97 Service Pack 2.

<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new ActiveX Control project. UserControl1 is created by
   default.

<P><LI>Set some of UserControl1's properties to the following:
<P>
<P><PRE>      ScaleMode = 3 - Pixel
      Backcolor = Blue or some color other than gray
</PRE>
<P><LI>Close UserControl1. It now appears in the Toolbox.

<P><LI>Select Add Project from the File menu and add a Standard EXE.
   Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Place the following controls on Form1:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Two CommandButton controls(Command1 and Command2);
      One PictureBox (Picture1);
      One UserControl1(UserControl11) that was just created;
</PRE><P>
   (NOTE: Make Picture1 large and UserControl11 small so that the
   undesired behavior is more obvious.)

<P><LI>Set Picture1's ScaleMode to 3 - Pixel.

<P><LI>Insert the following code to Command1's Click event procedure:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Set UserControl11.Container = Picture1
      UserControl11.Top = 0
      UserControl11.Left = 0
</PRE>
<P><LI>Insert the following code to Command2's Click event procedure:
<P>
<P><PRE>      UserControl11.Top = 0
      UserControl11.Left = 0
      UserControl11.Width = UserControl11.Width + 30
</PRE>
<P><LI>Press the F5 key to run the application

<P><LI>Click on Command1 first. Usercontrol11 should be placed inside
<P><PRE>    the Picture1.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click on Command2. UserControl11 should increase its width. It also
<P><PRE>    moves in Picture1.
