<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Professional Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic programming system
<PRE>  for Windows, version 3.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If a Visual Basic version 2.0 for Windows form file contains THREED.VBX
controls with the Font3D property set to a value greater than zero,
Visual Basic version 3.0 may incorrectly force other THREED.VBX controls
to have the same Font3D property value.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The THREED.VBX custom control for Visual Basic 2.0 does not write a Font3D
value to the form file if Font3D = 0. When Visual Basic version 3.0 loads
he form, after the Visual Basic environment reads a Font3D value for one
control, it gives the same Font3D property value to all the rest of the
THREED.VBX controls. In other words, if the last THREED.VBX control loaded
is the only one that has a Font3D entry in the form file, none of the
other controls are affected.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around the problem, edit the Visual Basic version 2.0 form files
that were saved in ASCII text format to add a Font3D = 0 line to any
THREED.VBX controls that do not already have a Font3D entry.
<P>
Visual Basic version 2.0 form files that were saved in the binary format
can be changed after they are loaded into Visual Basic version 3.0.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. This problem has been corrected in Visual
Basic version 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following is an example of a Visual Basic version 2.0 form file
that was saved in ASCII format with two 3D command buttons. One button
has a Font3D value, and one does not. Note that controls are saved in
the form file in the opposite order in which they were created on
the form.
<P>
VERSION 2.00
Begin Form Form1
<PRE>   Caption         =   "Form1"
   Height          =   6636
   Left            =   828
   LinkTopic       =   "Form1"
   ScaleHeight     =   6216
   ScaleWidth      =   6420
   Top             =   1152
   Width           =   6516
   Begin SSCommand Command3D2
      Caption         =   "Command3D2"
      Font3D          =   1  'Raised w/light shading
      Height          =   1092
      Left            =   720
      TabIndex        =   1
      Top             =   2640
      Width           =   3012
   End
   Begin SSCommand Command3D1
      Caption         =   "Command3D1"
      Height          =   1212
      Left            =   720
      TabIndex        =   0
      Top             =   840
      Width           =   3012
   End
</PRE>End
<P>
Notice that there is not a Font3D setting for Command3D1. If this file
were loaded into Visual Basic version 3.0, Command3D1 would have a Font3D
value of 1 instead of 0.
<P>
To work around the problem, insert the following line between the Caption
and Height lines for Command3D1 in the ASCII form file shown above:
<P>
<PRE>   Font3D = 0

</PRE>Now, Visual Basic version 3.0 will read the file correctly.
<P>
The Visual Basic 3.0 THREED.VBX writes the Font3D property to the form file
for every THREED.VBX control regardless of its value.
