The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Standard, Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft
   Visual Basic, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The files for a 16-bit Visual Basic program created under Windows 95 are
copied to a Windows NT server so that other users can have access to the
files. A user running Windows for Workgroups connects to the NT server and
copies all the files from the server. Running the application results in an
error message stating that the program requires a different operating
system.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The files required to run the program were not registered or installed in
the proper directories.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Use Setup Wizard to create a setup program. Copy that setup program and
compressed files to the server. Have the user run the installation program
from the server to install the files in the correct directory and properly
register them.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A Visual Basic program copied to a new directory will not run for the
following reasons:

<OL><P><LI>All Visual Basic 16-bit programs require OLE version 2.03 or later
   components. These components must be registered in the registry of the
   local system using the Visual Basic program.

<P><LI>Additional files, such as OCX custom controls and DLL files, must be
   registered in the registry of the local system.

<P><LI>Shared components, such as those required by JET, must be installed in
   particular directories. If these components are installed in other
   directories, the components will not run properly.
<P>
</OL>The Setup Wizard shipping with Visual Basic creates a setup program and
compresses the necessary files to run the program. The setup program
expands those files on the local machine and registers those files.
