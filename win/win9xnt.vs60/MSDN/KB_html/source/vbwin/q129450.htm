The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Standard, Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft
   Visual Basic, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using "For Each" to iterate through the elements of a control array
that changes dynamically during the execution of the loop, the following
unexpected behavior may occur:

<UL><LI>Elements added after the For Each is started are not visited during its
   execution.

<LI>Elements deleted after the For Each is started are visited and generate
   error 340:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Control array element 'n' doesn't exist.
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The set of items (to be iterated over by the For Each) is set at the
beginning of the iteration. Items added or deleted during the iteration do
not affect the set of items iterated over.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add a Command button (Command1) to your form.

<P><LI>Set the Index property of Command1 to 0 (zero). This will create a
   control array with one element. You then refer to your control as
   Command1(0).

<P><LI>Add the following code to the Form_Click event of Form1.
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Form_Click()
         On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
         Load Command1(1)
         Load Command1(2)
         Load Command1(3)

         For Each Elt In Command1
            Print "This is Command1("; Elt.Index; ")"
            If Elt.Index = 0 Then
               Unload Command1(2)
               Load Command1(4)
            End If

      SkipToHereOnError:
         Next
         Exit Sub

      ErrorHandler:
         Print Error$
         Resume SkipToHereOnError
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Start the program by choosing Start from the Run (or press the F5 key).

<P><LI>Click Form1 to run the code in the Click event.
<P>
</OL>The following will be printed on Form1:
<P>
<PRE>   This is Command1(0)
   This is Command1(1)
   Control array element '2' doesn't exist
   This is Command1(3)

</PRE></OL>Note that attempting to access Command1(2) generates an error because it is
unloaded at the first iteration of the loop, and that Command1(4) is not
printed.
