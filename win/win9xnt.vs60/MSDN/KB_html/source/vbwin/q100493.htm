1      Software Installation Information
2      Notes and Tips
3      Notes for "Learning Microsoft Visual Basic" Tutorial
4      Notes for Microsoft Visual Basic Online Help
5      Notes for Microsoft Visual Basic "Programmer's Guide"
6      Notes for Microsoft Visual Basic "Language Reference"
7      Notes for Microsoft Visual Basic "Custom Control Reference"
8      Notes for Microsoft Visual Basic "Data Access Guide"
<P>
 
<P><h2>Part 1: Software Installation Information</h2>
 
<P>
To install Visual Basic, use the Program Manager or File Manager to start
SETUP.EXE as you would any other Windows-based application. For example,
if you are installing from drive A:

<UL><LI>From the Program Manager File menu, choose Run.
<LI>In the Run dialog box, type A:SETUP and choose OK.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>From the File Manager, double-click the SETUP.EXE file icon
   on drive A.
<P>
</UL> 
<P><h3>File Sharing for OLE and Data Access</h3>
 
<P>
You will need SHARE.EXE to enforce file and byte range locking if the
following programs are running simultaneously:

<UL><LI>Two Visual Basic applications that perform data access
<LI>Two instances of one Visual Basic application that performs data access
<LI>Microsoft Access and a Visual Basic application that performs data
   access
<P>
</UL>If you are running Microsoft Windows 3.0 or Windows 3.1 (i.e. not
Windows for Workgroups), you will need to change your AUTOEXEC.BAT
as follows:
<P>
<PRE>     SHARE /L:500 /F:5100

</PRE>If the /L or the /F setting to SHARE has a larger value than listed here,
leave the setting as it is rather than reducing it.
<P>
Please make this change as soon as possible in your system.
<P>
NOTE: If you ship .EXE files to users that use OLE or data access, they
must add this setting to their AUTOEXEC.BAT file as well.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Visual C++ and GRID.VBX</h3>
 
<P>
If you plan to install Microsoft Visual C++(TM) Development System for
Windows on your system, you may overwrite the grid control in your Windows
\SYSTEM directory. Before installing Visual C++, make a backup of GRID.VBX.
If you have already installed Visual C++, you can re-install GRID.VBX by
running Setup again, choosing the Custom Installation button, and then
selecting the Microsoft Visual Basic option.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Using Visual Basic 3.0 with SQL Server and Access 1.0</h3>
 
<P>
If you choose to install the SQL Server ODBC driver, you will find the file
INSTCAT.SQL in the \VB\ODBC directory. This is a stored procedure file that
the SQL Server administrator must run on the server to prepare the server
to accept Visual Basic as a client. However, this version of INSTCAT.SQL is
incompatible with Microsoft Access 1.0. If you are also using Access 1.0
as a client for that SQL Server, you should use the INSTCAT.SQL that was
included with Access 1.0. Visual Basic 3.0 will work correctly with
INSTCAT.SQL from Access 1.0 except that it will be unable to delete indexes
from tables.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Setup and LZEXPAND.DLL</h3>
 
<P>
Visual Basic's Setup program uses LZEXPAND to install ODBC. If you
encounter a system error while Visual Basic is calculating free disk space,
check for this file in your Windows \SYSTEM directory. If an older version
of LZEXPAND.DLL exists along your path, remove the file and continue with
Setup.
<P>
 
<P><h2>Part 2: Notes and Tips</h2>
 
<P>
 
<P><h3>Data Access Compatibility - Visual Basic 2.0 and 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
The new functionality of the Microsoft Access engine in Visual Basic 3.0
will affect the behavior of your VB 2.0 code. Visual Basic 3.0 will
now assume that all SQL statements take the form of Access SQL (see the
Access documentation). You can passthrough SQL to ODBC; as a second
parameter to the CreateDynaset method, you must specify &amp;H40 to indicate
SQL passthrough. Note that if you used backend-specific SQL with
CreateDynaset, you must add this parameter.
<P>
 
<P><h3>ATI Driver</h3>
 
<P>
If you have an ATI Wonder card, moving the data control around at design
time may cause a GP fault. Contact ATI for more information.
<P>
 
<P><h3>BackColor Displayed Incorrectly with 256-Color Bitmaps</h3>
 
<P>
If you have a 256-color bitmap in any control (or the form) that has a
BackColor property, it is possible that the background color of that object
will not display correctly if no color in the bitmap's palette matches the
background color.
<P>
 
<P><h3>"Communication Link Failure" Error</h3>
 
<P>
If you receive a "Communication Link Failure" error when executing queries
against a Microsoft or Sybase SQL Server, you can retry the operation with
asynchronous execution disabled. To do this, add the following entry to
your VB.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>     [Debug]
     RmtTrace=16

</PRE>Visual Basic will continue to run synchronously until this line is removed
from VB.INI.
<P>
 
<P><h3>OLE Class Names</h3>
 
<P>
To get a reference to a currently running OLE application by using its
class name, you must use:
<P>
<PRE>      GetObject(, "classname")

</PRE>that is, GetObject has to have an empty file name. A file name of "" will
create a new instance of the server for class name. This is contradictory
to what is documented.
<P>
 
<P><h3>OLE Control: In-Place Activation</h3>
 
<P>
The Visual Basic OLE 2.0 control supports "Inside-Out Activation," which
corresponds to "activation on GetFocus."  If a server designates this
capability and you specify AutoActivate = GETFOCUS, then:

<UL><LI>The object is initially deactivated the first time the control gets the
   focus.
<LI>The object is not fully deactivated when the control loses focus.
   Instead, the object is directed to tear down any floating user interface
   it may have, such as tool pallettes.
<P>
</UL>Note that AutoActivate = GETFOCUS is only supported if the server claims to
be "inside-out-capable," further reducing the possibility of looping
re-activation when a non-insitu server closes and gives focus back to the
control.
<P>
 
<P><h3>OLE Control: Pasting Objects from the Clipboard</h3>
 
<P>
Applications that provide objects behave differently when an object is
deleted. When you delete an OLE object (set Action = 10), the object's
application may or not close. If the application does close, any objects
on the Clipboard associated with that application may also be closed.
Because of this, you may not be able to cut an object (copy, then delete),
since deleting the object may also cause the data on the Clipboard to be
deleted.
<P>
Another instance of this behavior is when you try to copy an object, then
paste the object back onto itself. This action may cause an error, because
in order to paste over an existing object, the existing object is first
deleted. If the application associated with the object closes, and
subsequently deletes any objects it has on the Clipboard, the Clipboard no
longer contains an object to paste.
<P>
 
<P><h3>OLE Control: The PasteOK Property</h3>
 
<P>
The following applies to objects on the Clipboard that come from an OLE
object:

<UL><LI>When PasteOK returns True, there is no guarantee that the Paste
   operation will succeed. For example, PasteOK returns True and the Paste
   fails when there is a linked object on the Clipboard and you are pasting
   into an object whose OleTypeAllowed property is set to 1 (Embedded).
<LI>PasteOK returns False when there is a linked object on the Clipboard and
   you are pasting into an object whose OleTypeAllowed property is set to
   0 (Linked).
<P>
</UL> 
<P><h3>OLE Control: Link Target</h3>
 
<P>
You cannot activate a linked object as hidden (set Verb = -3). You can,
however, activate an embedded object as hidden.
<P>
 
<P><h3>OLE Constants in CONSTANT.TXT</h3>
 
<P>
OLE has also defined two new standard verbs relating to the two states that
an in-place-active object can have. The following corresponding constants
have been added to CONSTANT.TXT:
<P>
<PRE>Constant                  Description
</PRE> 
<PRE>VERB_INPLACEUIACTIVATE    Object is fully in-place active, including
                          floating UI. Only one at a time per top-level
                          form can be in this state.

VERB_INPLACEACTIVATE      Object is semi-active; it is running and ready to
                          respond to user input like clicking within the
                          object or changing the mouse pointer as the user
                          moves the mouse over different parts of the
                          object. Any number of objects can be in this
                          state at a time.

</PRE>So, if you have a number of inside-out-capable objects on a form, where the
user has specified AutoActivate = ONGETFOCUS, the objects take turns at
being in-place-UI-Active. The new verbs allow the Visual Basic programmer
to cause these objects to be in the in-place-active state. For example, if
you want to create a form with several of these objects, and you want the
form to be as responsive as possible to user input, you would put the
following code for each control into your Form_Load event handler:
<P>
<PRE>     OLEControl.Verb = VERB_INPLACEACTIVATE
     OLEControl.Action = OLE_ACTIVATE

</PRE>See the file CONSTANT.TXT for more information.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Windows 3.0 and the PopupMenu Method</h3>
 
<P>
Under Windows 3.0, pop-up menus invoked during a MouseDown event in some
cases do not recognize menu selections made with the mouse. If that occurs,
you can still make a selection using the arrow keys and the Enter key.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Saving ASCII Forms in Source Code Managers</h3>
 
<P>
When using source code managers, you need to change the read-only bit on
the binary file (.FRX) as well as the form file (.FRM) to save the form.
<P>
 
<P><h3>Crystal Reports for Visual Basic</h3>
 
<P>
All prices in the Crystal Reports for Visual Basic editor, CRW.EXE, are
listed in US dollars.
<P>
If you are calling Crystal Services from outside the United States for
support or more information, please contact your local international
long distance carrier if you need assistance.
<P>
 
<P><h2>Part 3: Notes for "Learning Microsoft Visual Basic" Tutorial</h2>
 
<P>
 
<P><h3>Save Project Before Run</h3>
 
<P>
The Save Project Before Run Environment Option (under the Options menu)
should be set to "No" when running the "Learning Visual Basic" tutorial.
Some of the lessons may be impaired if this option is set to "Yes."  By
default, this setting is "No."
<P>
 
<P><h2>Part 4: Notes for Microsoft Visual Basic Online Help</h2>
 
<P>
 
<P><h3>Error Message Help</h3>
 
<P>
Online Help is not available for dialogs or error messages that occur at
design time. For ISAM errors, use the Search dialog in Help.
<P>
 
<P><h3>"Couldn't find installable ISAM"</h3>
 
<P>
An external file dynamic link library (DLL) file couldn't be found. This
file is required for operations such as attaching or accessing external
tables.
<P>
Possible causes:

<OL><P><LI>An entry in the [Installable ISAM] section in VB.INI or &lt;APPNAME&gt;.INI is
   incorrect. For example, this error occurs if you're accessing a Paradox
   external table, and the Paradox entry of the .INI file points to a
   nonexistent directory. Exit Visual Basic, make necessary corrections in
   VB.INI or &lt;APPNAME&gt;.INI using Microsoft Windows Notepad or another text
   editor, restart Visual Basic, and try the operation again.

<P><LI>One of the entries in the [Installable ISAM] section in VB.INI points to
   a network drive, and that drive isn't connected. Check to make sure the
   network is available and the proper drive letter is established, and try
   the operation again.
<P>
</OL> 
<P><h2>Part 5: Notes for Microsoft Visual Basic "Programmer's Guide"</h2>
 
<P>
Page   Section/Note
 
188    The New Keyword
<P>
<PRE>       In the example at the top of the page, the local form
       variable F is declared with the New keyword using the
       Dim statement. To make the form variable and the
       loaded form instance persist, use a Static or Global
       variable instead.

</PRE></OL>194    Determining the Type of an Object Variable
<P>
<PRE>       You can use the If...TypeOf statement to determine the
       control type of a custom control:

    If TypeOf object Is objecttype

       The identifier you use for 'object' is the class name of
       the custom control. See the section "Specific Control
       Object Types" (p. 186) for more information.

</PRE>461    The Options Property
<P>
<PRE>       The constant values shown are in hexidecimal and should be
       preceded with the &amp;H notation. For example,
       DB_SQLPASSTHROUGH = &amp;H40, not decimal 40. See online Help
       (Options Property) or the file DATACONS.TXT for the correct
       values.

</PRE>462    The RecordSource Property
<P>
<PRE>       The following text and example should be changed:

       For example, the following SQL query returns all of the columns
       in the bibliography for authors who live in New York:

    Data1.DatabaseName = "BIBLIO.MDB"
    Data1.RecordSource = "Select * from Titles where state = 'NY'"
    Data1.Refresh

       The above should read:

       For example, the following SQL query returns all of the columns
       in the bibliography for publishers based in New York:

    Data1.DatabaseName = "BIBLIO.MDB"
    Data1.RecordSource = "Select * from Publishers where state = 'NY'"
    Data1.Refresh

</PRE>465    Adding a New Record
<P>
<PRE>       In the second paragraph in this section, the last sentence
       should read, "Notice that using the buttons on the data
       control or one of the Move methods to move to another record
       will automatically save your added record."

</PRE>530    Determining How an Object Is Displayed
<P>
<PRE>       In the first paragraph, the second sentence should read,
       "the Icon check box," not "th eIcon check box."

</PRE>550    Creating Invisible Objects
<P>
<PRE>       In the sample code, the following line has incorrect syntax:

   MyWord = ObjVar.SuggestWord MyWord

       The code should look like this:

   MyWord = ObjVar.SuggestWord (MyWord)

</PRE>552    Limitations in Visual Basic
<P>
<PRE>       Under the discussion "Arrays and User-Defined Types," the third
       bulleted item should read: "You cannot...Assign the return value
       of a property or method to an array variable or a variable of a
       user-defined type."

</PRE>554    Closing an Object
<P>
<PRE>       In the paragraph after the sample code, second sentence:  It is
       not true that invoking a Close method on an object sets variables
       that refer to the object to Nothing.

</PRE>582    Determining the Files You Need to Distribute
<P>
<PRE>       The following additional files are required for distributing
       your Visual Basic applications:

       DLL Name       Required by (Professional Edition Only)
       ------------------------------------------------------
       PDIRJET.DLL    Crystal Reports for Visual Basic

21-22  Action Property (OLE)
<P>
<PRE>       In the Settings table, in Setting 5, the reference to None in the
       second sentence of the third paragraph should read as follows:
       "If the Paste was not successful, the OleType property will be set
       to 3 (None)."  In Setting 12, the constant should be
       OLE_READ_FROM_FILE, not ReadFromFile. In Setting 14, the constant
       should be OLE_INSERT_OBJ_DLG.

       common dialog control, this property returns a device context for
       the printer selected in the Print dialog box when the..." (the rest
       of the text remains the same).

<PRE>       The See Also line should refer to the "Width # Statement," not the
       "Width Statement."

</PRE>274    Image Control
<P>
<PRE>       Add DataField and DataSource to the Properties list.

       SendKeys Method.

</PRE>299    KeyPress Events
<P>
<PRE>       The See Also should refer to the SendKeys Statement, not the
       SendKeys Method.

</PRE>303    Label Control
<P>
<PRE>       Add the DataField, DataSource, and Parent properties to the
       Properties list.

</PRE>336-   ListFields Method
338
<PRE>       In the second table, the fifth and sixth entries in the Field column
       should be SourceTable and SourceField, not SourceTableName and
       SourceFieldName. The code example and the headings of the table
       below it should also refer to SourceTable and SourceField.

</PRE>345    ListTables Method
<P>
<PRE>       In Remarks, the first paragraph under the TableType field table
       should read: "When you use the ListTables method to create a
       Snapshot, you can evaluate the contents of the Attributes field in
       the Snapshot by referring to the TableDef property settings table in
       the Attributes property topic.

       (Font, Print dialogs)."

</PRE>390    Name Property
<P>
<PRE>       The "Applies To" line should include the Database object.

</PRE>432    Partition Function
<P>
<PRE>       In the code in Example 3, the second five lines of code duplicate
       the first five lines and should be deleted.

</PRE>439    Picture Box Control
<P>
<PRE>       Add DataField and DataSource to the Properties list.

</PRE>536-   SourceFieldName, SourceTableName Properties

       online Help for the text of this topic.

</PRE>565    Text Box Control
<P>
<PRE>       The second piece of art is incorrect. It should show a text box
       on a form but instead shows a menu title and menu items on a form.
       Also, add DataField and DataSource to the Properties list.

</PRE>595    Validate Event

<PRE>       In the third paragraph following the Constants table, change "edit
       buffer" to "copy buffer."

</PRE>619    Trappable Errors
<P>
<PRE>       In Appendix B, the odd header is wrong. It should read "Trappable
       Errors," not "Trappable Error Messages."

</PRE>634    Trappable Error Messages
<P>
<PRE>       In Table B.6 ("Data Access Trappable Error Messages"), Error #3137
       should be deleted.

xxii   Visual Basic Executable (.EXE) Files
<P>
<PRE>       The Visual Basic run-time file is listed incorrectly. The first
       bulleted item should read VBRUN300.DLL, not VBRUN200.DLL.

</PRE>147   Graph Control
<P>
<PRE>      In Example 1, the following line contains two "=" characters:

   Graph1.LabelText = "Data point" = Str$(i%)

      The line should read:

   Graph1.LabelText = "Data point" + Str$(i%)

</PRE>148    Graph Control
<P>
<PRE>       In Example 2, the following line contains two "=" characters:

       Graph1.LabelText = "Label" = Str$(i%)

       The line should read:

       Graph1.LabelText = "Label" + Str$(i%)

</PRE>176    Key Status Control
<P>
<PRE>       The table for the Value property incorrectly states that False is
       the default value. The default value is determined by the state
       of the keyboard.

</PRE>180    MAPI Session Control
<P>
<PRE>       There should be no footnotes, since the MAPI controls are
       only available in Visual Basic.

</PRE>186    MAPI Messages Control
<P>
<PRE>       There should be no footnotes, since the MAPI controls are
