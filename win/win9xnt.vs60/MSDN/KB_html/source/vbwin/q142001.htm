<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article covers some of the most frequently asked questions (FAQ) about
the Structured Query Language (SQL) for Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows.
You can find this and other FAQ articles by querying in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base using the keyword FAQ.
<P>
The Visual Basic 3.0 FAQ covering SQL Queries may contain additional
information regarding a portion of these questions. This FAQ is in the
process of being completed. More frequently asked questions will be added
to this article by the end of January 1996.
<P>
NOTE: Many of the SQL statements in this article use the Biblio.mdb Access
database that ships with Visual Basic.
<P>
For more information on SQL queries, please see the following articles in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : INF: Rushmore Query Optimization Paper Available on MSL

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<PRE>1. Q. How can I test my SQL query quickly and easily?

   A. Use VisData. VisData is a sample application that ships with Visual
      Basic 4.0. You'll find it in C:\VB\Samples\VisData\VisData.vbp. It
      has a window to test SQL queries, can open all of the database types
      that Visual Basic supports, and has proven to be very stable.

2. Q. How do I write an SQL query that has values that contain single or
      double quotation marks?

   A. Single quotation marks ('), double quotation marks ("), and the pipe
      symbol (|) are all special characters in Microsoft Jet SQL. Double up
      the quotation marks or, if you have only one type of quotation mark
      (single or double) in your data, use the other one as the delimiter.
      All other characters are handled as is.

3. Q. How do I use a Visual Basic variable in an SQL query?

   A. Visual Basic variables and properties must be concatenated into the
      SQL string. If you embed the name of the variable, your code will
      search using the variable name rather than the variable value.

4. Q. How can I call stored procedures (queries) for SQL Server databases?

   A. You can pass the stored procedure name to an ExecuteSQL, a
      CreateDynaset, or a DataControl's RecordSource property.

5. Q. How can I select a specific list of values or exclude certain records
      in a Select statement?

   A. Use the In keyword to identify the values you want to include or
      exclude, adding the Not keyword to exclude, as in this example:

      Select * From Authors Where Au_ID In (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
      Select * From Authors Where Au_ID Not In (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)

6. Q. How can I build a Select statement that works with multiple tables?

   A. A simple Select statement across unrelated tables returns a useless
      cross product of all the records in the tables listed in the From
      clause:

      Select * From Publishers, Titles

      To get a useful list of data, your data must have a common key field
      (or set of fields) that relate the tables. You can retrieve data
      from your tables by simply ensuring that these key fields match for
      each row you retrieve:

      Select * From Publishers, Titles
         Where Publishers.PubID=Titles.PubID

      However, this returns rows without recognizing the relationship
      between the records in the separate tables, so the resulting
      RecordSet will not be updatable. To return an updatable recordset,
      you need to join the tables as in this example:

      Select * From Publishers
         Inner Join Titles On Publishers.PubID=Titles.PubID

      For more information, please see the "Joins" topic in the Visual
      Basic Help file and the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge
      Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../vbwin/q102681.htm">Q102681</A></B>
      TITLE     : PRB: Error When Updating Fields in Dynaset That Has
                  2+ Tables

7. Q. How can I build a Select statement that includes multiple tables in
      more than one database?

   A. You can specify an external database with the &lt;table&gt; IN &lt;database&gt;
      syntax, specify the connect string in your SQL query, or attach the
      tables to a Microsoft Access database.

8. Q. How can I return a default value in my Select statement result when
      the real value stored in the table is null?

   A. You can construct a SQL statement that returns a default value rather
      than Null for those records where the value is actually null and use
      the Union operator to add these records to those where the value is
      not null. For example, the following query returns the word Anonymous
      for any record in the Authors table where the Author field is null.
      (To make this example work, you need to add a record with an AU_ID
      value but no Author value.)

      (Select Author, Au_ID From Authors Where Not IsNull(Author))
         Union (Select "Anonymous" As Author, Au_ID From Authors Where
         IsNull(Author))

9. Q. How can I make my SQL statement run faster?

   A. For a list of hints, please see the following articles in the
      Microsoft Knowledge Base:

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../access/q112112.htm">Q112112</A></B>

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../vbwin/q129882.htm">Q129882</A></B>

      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../access/q99321.htm">Q99321</A></B>
      TITLE     : Tips for Optimizing Queries on Attached SQL Tables


</PRE>12.Q. Why can't I get a parameter query to work on the Data Control?
<P>
<PRE>   A. This is a limitation of the Data Control. It does not support
      parameter queries. The Properties window lists any available
      non-parameter queries, but does not list any parameter queries
      in the database, so it's not possible to make the mistake of
      using a parameter query for a Data Control at design time.

      The work around to this limitation is to run the parameterized query
      into a scratch recordset variable and then set that result into the
      recordset of the Data Control.
