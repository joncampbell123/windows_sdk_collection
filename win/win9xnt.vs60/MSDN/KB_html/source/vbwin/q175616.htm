The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 16-bit only, for Windows,
   version 4.0
   on the following platform: Win95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Error 438 occurs when running a program in which a form is assigned to a
variable and that variable is used to access a control on the form if the
program is on a system running Windows 95 with Regional Settings set to a
setting other than English (United States).  The error text is:
<P>
<PRE>   Run-Time Error #438:
   Object doesn't support this property or method

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two possible workarounds for this problem.

<UL><LI>Access the form directly rather than by a variable containing the form.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Create property procedures in the form's code to provide access to the
   properties of the controls on the form.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To reproduce this bug consistently, you will need HeapWalker, a utility
that ships with the Windows 16-bit Software Development Kit and the 16-bit
version of Visual C++.

<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>From Control Panel, click Regional Settings to open the Regional

   select New Project from the File menu,.

<P><LI>Add a CommandButton to Form1.

<P><LI>Copy the following code to the Code window of Form1:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Private Sub Command1_Click()
<PRE></PRE>         Dim MyForm As Form
         Dim i As Long
         Set MyForm = Form1
         For i = 1 To 10000
            MyForm.Command1.Caption = i
            DoEvents
         Next i
       End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>From the File menu, click Make EXE File to create an executable file.

<P><LI>Run the executable file and then click the CommandButton in your
