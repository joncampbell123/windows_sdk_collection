<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The linked list, which is a classical data structure with widespread
applicability in C++, can also be implemented in Visual Basic with the use
of Classes.
<P>
A linked list is a set of items organized sequentially, just like an array.
In an array, the sequential organization is provided implicitly (by
position in the array); in a linked list, you use an explicit arrangement
in which each item is part of a "node" that also contains a "link" to the
next node.
<P>
The primary advantage of linked lists over arrays is that linked lists can
grow and shrink in size during their lifetimes. In particular, their
maximum size need not be known in advance. A secondary advantage is that
they provide flexibility in allowing the items to be rearranged efficiently
without actually moving any data contained in the list.
<P>
A disadvantage of a linked list is that operations such as referencing a
specific element in the list require you to walk the entire list from head
to tail. In an array, this could simply be done by accessing an (n).
Another operation that does not work with a linked list is finding an item
before a given item. To get around these limitations, you can build a
doubly-linked list in which two links for each node are maintained, one to
the item before and one to the item after. The cost of providing this extra
capability is doubling the number of link manipulations per basic
operation. This article will only demonstrate a simple linked list, not a
doubly-linked list.
<P>

<P>
<P><h3>Sample Program</h3>
 
<P>
The following example creates a linked list of 20 nodes, and then reverses
it using a function named ReverseList. Each node in the list is actually an
instance of a Visual Basic Class created with the New keyword.

<OL><P><LI>Start a new project in Visual Basic and choose "Standard EXE." Form1 is
   created by default.

<P><LI>From the Project menu, choose Add Class Module, Class1 is created by
   default. In the Properties window of the new class module, change the
   name from Class1 to "Node," then Paste the following code into the
   General Declarations section of Node:
<P>
<PRE>      Public key As Integer          'var to hold some data
      Public pnext As node           'pointer to next node in list

</PRE><P><LI>Add a Command button, Command1, to Form1.

<P><LI>Paste the following code into the General Declarations section of Form1:
<P>
<PRE>      Dim head As node               'object pointer to head of list
      Private Sub Form_Load()
