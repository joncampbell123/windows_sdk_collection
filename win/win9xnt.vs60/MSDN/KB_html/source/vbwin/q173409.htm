The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Standard and Enterprise Editions for Windows,
   version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When calling an Automation server that passes your client application RDO
objects, the RDOErrors collection never contains error information if the
server is compiled as an ActiveX Automation EXE. RDOErrors collection will
contain error information if the server is compiled as an ActiveX
Automation DLL.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
You are obtaining the RDOErrors collection from your application's
RDOEngine object rather than from the server method,
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Provide a method or property on the server object from which to retrieve
the RDOErrors collection.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you compile a server component as a DLL, it has access to the same
global objects that the client does. Because of this, you can inadvertently
engage in practices that break object design principles. When you compile
the server to an ActiveX Automation EXE, it now has its own global objects
that are separate from the client application and object encapsulation
cannot be violated.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
Create the server:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new project with a MultiUse class module (named MyConnect)
   with the following code:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Public Function Connect () As rdoConnection
<PRE></PRE>        Set Connect = rdoEngine(0).OpenConnection("MyDSN",
                      rdDriverComplete, "uid=sa;pwd=;database=pubs")
      End Function
   
      Public Function Errors () As Variant
        Set Errors = rdoErrors
      End Function

</PRE><P><LI>Add a module with the following code:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Main ()
      End Sub
   
</PRE></OL>3. Remove the default form.

<OL><P><LI>Add a reference to Microsoft Remote Data Object.

<P><LI>Set Sub Main to be the Project Startup Form.

<P><LI>In the Project Options dialog, in the Compatibility tab, set Version
   Compatibility to No Compatibility. This will enable steps 7 and 8 to
   generate distinct server GUIDs for the EXE and DLL servers.

<P><LI>Change the project type to ActiveX DLL, name to DLLConnect, compile
   to a DLL, and save.

<P><LI>Change the project type to ActiveX EXE, name to EXEConnect, compile
   to an EXE, and save.
<P>
</OL>Create the client:

<OL><P><LI>Create a new project with a form and three CommandButtons.

<P><LI>Add a reference to Microsoft Remote Data Object, DLLConnect, and
   EXEConnect. You will have to add the last two by using the Browse
   feature of the References dialog.

<P><LI>Add the following code:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Private Sub Command1_Click()
      Dim Connector As DLLConnect.MyConnect
      Dim Conn As rdoConnection, rs As rdoResultset, E As rdoError
<PRE></PRE>        rdoEngine.rdoErrors.Clear
        Set Connector = New DLLConnect.MyConnect
        Set Conn = Connector.Connect
        On Error Resume Next
        Set rs = Conn.OpenResultset("THIS IS BAD SQL")
        For Each E In rdoErrors
          MsgBox E.Description
        Next E
        Conn.Close
      End Sub

      Private Sub Command2_Click()
      Dim Connector As EXEConnect.MyConnect
      Dim Conn As rdoConnection
      Dim rs As rdoResultset
      Dim E As rdoError
        rdoEngine.rdoErrors.Clear ' required to prevent previous error
                               ' from showing
        Set Connector = New EXEConnect.MyConnect
        Set Conn = Connector.Connect
        On Error Resume Next
        Set rs = Conn.OpenResultset("THIS IS BAD SQL")
        For Each E In rdoErrors
          MsgBox E.Description
        Next E
        Conn.Close
      End Sub

      Private Sub Command3_Click()
      Dim Connector As EXEConnect.MyConnect
      Dim Conn As rdoConnection
      Dim rs As rdoResultset
      Dim E As rdoError
      Dim Errors As Variant
        Set Connector = New EXEConnect.MyConnect
        Set Conn = Connector.Connect
        Set Errors = Connector.Errors
        Errors.Clear
        On Error Resume Next
        Set rs = Conn.OpenResultset("THIS IS BAD SQL")
        For Each E In Errors
          MsgBox E.Description
        Next E
        Conn.Close
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Run the program and press each of the CommandButtons in turn.
<P>
   Command1 and Command2 both break object programming standards because
   they refer to the global rdoErrors collection. The code for
   Command1_Click works (displays errors) because it runs the server as an
   in-process component, whereas Command2 doesn't work because the server
   is an out-of-process component and uses a different instance of
   RDOEngine.
   
   Command3 works with an out-of-process component because it follows
   object design principles and gets the errors collection from the
   Connector object and not from the RDOEngine global object.
<P>
</OL>NOTE:

<UL><LI>This problem can also affect ActiveX components that share DAO
   objects or other classes that have global objects.

<LI>This problem can also affect Visual Basic 4 and other 32-bit VBA
   products.
