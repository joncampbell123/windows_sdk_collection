The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for
   Windows, versions 2.0 and 3.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual Basic programming system for Windows, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Edit menu commands (such as Cut, Copy, Paste, and Undo) have no effect
when applied to selected text in the Properties Bar entry window.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Properties Bar entry window was not designed to handle the Edit menu
commands (such as Cut, Copy, Paste, and Undo). The Edit menu commands
affect the controls on the form, not the Properties Bar entry window even
if you first select text in the Properties Bar entry window before choosing
the Edit menu with the mouse.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Instead of choosing Edit commands with the mouse, select the desired text
in the Properties Bar entry window and use the Edit shortcut keys, as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>Command    Shortcut Keys
</PRE> 
<P>
<PRE>Cut        SHIFT+DELETE
Copy       CTRL+INSERT
Paste      SHIFT+INSERT
Undo       ALT+BACKSPACE

</PRE>NOTE: NUM LOCK needs to be off if you select the DELETE or INSERT key from
the numeric keypad.
<P>
For example, select text in the Properties Bar entry window. Then press
CTRL+INSERT (while NUM LOCK is off) to copy text to the Clipboard. Press
SHIFT+INSERT to paste clipboard text into the Properties Bar entry window.
Press ALT+BACKSPACE to undo a cut, copy, or paste.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose New Project.

<P><LI>Double-click a label box from the Toolbox (symbolized by a capital A in
   script). This should display a label box on the form.

<P><LI>With the mouse, select the text fragment "Lab" from the "Label1"
   Caption in the Properties Bar entry window, and choose Copy from
   the Edit menu.
<P>
   NOTE: While you may have thought you just copied "Lab" into the
   Clipboard, you actually copied the entire Label1 control (from
   the form) into the Clipboard. Clicking the Edit menu anywhere
   outside the Properties Bar entry window causes the focus to
   revert back to the Label1 control on the form.

<P><LI>Click the "Form1" text appearing in the Properties Bar entry
   window to set the focus there.

<P><LI>From the Edit menu, choose Paste (again, clicking the Edit menu or
   anywhere outside the Properties Bar entry window causes the focus to
   revert back to the Label1 control on the form.) This causes the
   following message box to appear:
<P>
<P><PRE>      "You already have a control named 'Label1'. Do you want to
       create a control array?".
</PRE><P>
   Select either the Yes or No command button. Notice that
   another copy of the Label1 box will appear in the upper left
   corner of the form.
