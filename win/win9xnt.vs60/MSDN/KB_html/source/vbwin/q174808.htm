The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Learning, Professional, and Enterprise Editions
   for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A project compiled in native code shows poor performance. This behavior
occurs because the project contains calls to subroutines using the GoSub
statement.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The GoSub statement has not been optimized in Visual Basic.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Instead of using sub-routines, use functions in a module or place your code
inside an event.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The GoSub statement is still provided for backward compatibility to older
versions of Visual Basic. However, the GoSub statement was not optimized
because of potential problems it can cause with the stack. Therefore, you
should not use subs of functions in your project. You will get much better
performance by calling a function in a module or placing the code inside an
event.
<P>
The following section contains instructions on how to create a sample
program that demonstrates the performance differences between inline code,
calling a function in a module, and calling a sub-routine using the GoSub
statement.
<P>
For each method, the values of two variables are swapped 1,000,000 times
and the time to perform this task is shown on a message box. Each method is
in a project that is compiled to native code. The following are the results
when this project was run on a Pentium 200Mhz computer with 64Mb of memory
running Windows NT Server version 4.0:

<UL><LI>Inline code           .016 seconds
<LI>Function call         .031 seconds
<LI>GoSub Statement      2.260 seconds
<P>
</UL>Your results may vary depending on the system configuration used to run
this test. Note that the time differences will not be evident if you run
the projects from within the Visual Basic IDE. To see the performance
difference, you need to compile each project as a native code executable
file.
<P>
To create the sample project, you will need to create four projects:

<OL><P><LI>Inline Code project - contains inline code. This project will be
   compiled to a native code executable file.

<P><LI>Function Call project - contains a project that calls a function in a
   module. This project will be compiled to a native code executable file.

<P><LI>GoSub Statement project - contains a subroutine that is called within
   the Click event using the GoSub statement. This project will be
   compiled to a native code executable file.

<P><LI>Sample project - contains the code to call the first three executable
   files. This project can be run within the Visual Basic IDE.
<P>
</OL><h3>Create the Inline Code Project</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
