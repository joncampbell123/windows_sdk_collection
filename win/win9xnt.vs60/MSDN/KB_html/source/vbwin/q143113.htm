<P>
The MSComm control encapsulates much of the functionality provided by the
communications functions of the Windows API. This encapsulation makes these
functions easier to use but does limit the functionality of the MSComm
control. Here are some tips for troubleshooting the MSComm control.

      TITLE     : BUG: Serial Port Driver for WFW 3.11 Sends Extra Byte

</PRE><P><LI>Use the Windows Accessories Terminal application (HyperTerminal in
   Windows 95) to determine if a connection can be established independent
   of Visual Basic. This will determine if a connection can be made using
   only the communication functions in the Windows API. If a connection can
   not be made, examine the physical elements of the connection. Is the
   proper cable being used? Is it connected to the serial port? If a
   connection can be made, note the settings that were used and use the
   same settings with the MSComm control.

<P><LI>Use the Visual Basic VBTerm and Dialer sample applications with the
   appropriate settings. If these work, use this code as a starting point
   for your application. If they don't work, first try the suggestions
   below on these samples. If these suggestions fix the problem, then use
   the samples as a starting point. Otherwise start with the simplest code
   possible and use the following suggestions as a starting point.

<P><LI>Set the RTSEnable property of the MSComm control to True. Many modems
   and other communication devices use the RTS signal for handshaking.

<P><LI>If the Visual Basic application using the MSComm control is running on a
   Windows for Workgroups 3.11 machine with a 16550AF UART chip and the
   InBufferSize property is greater than 1024, COMxFIFO=0 must be added to
   the [386Enh] section of the System.ini file. This entry disables the
   FIFO buffer of COMx's 16550 UART. If a serial port does not have a 16550
   UART, this setting is ignored. The default value is 1 (enabled).

<P><LI>Set the RThreshold property to 1. If you set the RThreshold property to
   any other value, you may have trouble unless all of your data consists
   of fixed-length packets.

<P><LI>Set the Interval property to 55 for best performance. (The default of
   1000 is too long.)

<P><LI>Set the InputLen property to 0 unless there is an overriding reason not
   to.

<P><LI>Always receive data when data is available. Don't rely on the
<P><PRE>    RThreshold property to tell you if data is available. Use the OnComm
    event procedure. Double-buffer the incoming data. Extract the data from
    the buffer and process it. Clean up the buffer to remove the processed
    data. For example:
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    Sub Comm1_OnComm ()
       Static ReceiveBuffer As String
       ReceiveBuffer = ReceiveBuffer &amp; Comm1.Input
       'Always buffer incoming data no matter what generated the OnComm
       'event.
       If Len(ReceiveBuffer &gt;= Limit) Then
<PRE></PRE>         Call Process(Left$(ReceiveBuffer,Limit))
         ReceiveBuffer = Right$(ReceiveBuffer, Len(ReceiveBuffer) - Limit)
         'Cleans-up buffer.
       End If
    End Sub
    'If you are looking for a terminating character sequence instead of
    'length, then the test would use InStr instead of Len.

   This procedure double-buffers the received data and, unless the program
   is bound to fail because of some other performance problems, provides
   good security for the received data. It is extremely important to handle
   every character as it comes in at high baud rates.

</PRE></OL><h2>REFERENCES</h2>
 
<P>
If the MSComm control is not satisfactory, the communication APIs available
in Windows may provide the necessary solution. Daniel Appleman's "Visual
Basic Programmer's Guide To The Windows API" book is an excellent resource
for the 16-bit communications APIs as is the VBComDem sample (<B><A href="../vbwin/q75856.htm">Q75856</A></B>). For
information on using the 32-bit communications APIs see "Create
Communications Programs for Windows 95 with the Win32 Comm API" in the
December 1994 issue of the Microsoft Systems Journal.
