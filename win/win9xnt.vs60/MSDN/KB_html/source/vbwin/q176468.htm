   Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
As a developer, you need to consider several aspects of form behavior when
developing an ActiveX document application that uses forms. Because the
ActiveX document application will always be run within a container
application, forms may behave differently than when within a standard
Visual Basic project. This article will describe the key considerations
that must be taken when developing forms for an ActiveX application.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Although an ActiveX document can be displayed in varying containers, this
article will focus on using Internet Explorer as the container.
<P>
<P><h3>Client Navigation</h3>
 
<P>
Users of Internet Explorer have the freedom of navigating to different
pages when they visit your ActiveX document. They can navigate forward,
backward, or to a specific URL address. If a Visual Basic form is open when
a user navigates to a new page, the form will remain open, visible on the
Windows desktop behind Internet Explorer. The form will remain open until
the user or the application closes it, even after the ActiveX document has
been terminated.
<P>
You cannot prevent a user from navigating. However, you can program your
application to detect when navigation occurs. The UserDocument Hide event
will fire when a user navigates to a new page from your ActiveX document
application. This event may then be used to handle your forms behavior when
a user navigates off your page.
<P>
For example, you could create a Public boolean variable named
flagIsFormOpen to keep track of when the form was open. This variable would
need to be declared in the General Declarations section of a standard code
module native to your ActiveX document project:
<P>
<PRE>   Public flagFormIsOpen As Boolean

</PRE>The forms Load and Unload events could then be used to set the value of
flagIsFormOpen to True or False:
<P>
<PRE>   Private Sub Form_Load()
      flagFormIsOpen = True
   End Sub

   Private Sub Form_Unload(Cancel As Integer)
      flagFormIsOpen = False
   End Sub

</PRE>Next, check for the value of the variable in the Hide event of the
UserDocument, and handle the forms behavior appropriately:
<P>
<PRE>   Private Sub UserDocument_Hide()
       If flagFormIsOpen Then
          frmDetails.Visible = False
       End If
   End Sub

</PRE>In the example above, the name of the form is "frmDetails." When a user
navigates away from the UserDocument, the Hide event checks for the value
of the flagFormIsOpen variable. If the Form is open, hide the form.
<P>
Next, determine if a user returns to the page before the ActiveX document
application is terminated and display the form to the user. If a user
navigates back to the ActiveX document before it is terminated, the
UserDocument's Show event fires:
<P>
<PRE>   Private Sub UserDocument_Show()
      If flagFormIsOpen then
         frmDetails.Visible = True
      End if
   End Sub

</PRE>Finally, as a general rule, forms should be unloaded when the object that
created them terminates. Therefore, the ActiveX document should unload any
open forms it created when the ActiveX document terminates. The ActiveX
document may terminate in various scenarios. The Terminate event of the
UserDocument can be used to unload the form if it is still open:
<P>
<PRE>   Private Sub UserDocument_Terminate()
      If flagFormIsOpen Then
         Unload frmDetails
      End If
   End Sub

</PRE>NOTE: If the visible property a form is set to False, the Form will be
Unloaded automatically when the Terminate event fires. When this occurs,
however, the QueryUnload event of the form does not fire and the Cancel
argument of the Unload event is ignored.
<P>
<P><h3>Modal Forms</h3>
 
<P>
The behavior of modal forms in ActiveX Documents is inconsistent between
different versions of Internet Explorer, on different operating systems,
and between in-process (DLL) and out-of-process (EXE) servers. When a modal
form is opened within an ActiveX document, the desired behavior would be to
have the form modal to the UserDocument and the container application.
However, this is not always the case. The chart below shows the varying
behavior of modal forms:
<P>
<PRE>                IE3/95    IE3/NT   IE4/95   IE4/NT
                ------------------------------------
ActiveX EXE     Partial   Partial  Partial  Partial
ActiveX DLL     Modal     Modal    Modal    Modeless

</PRE>In the chart above, "modal" means the modal form behaved as a true modal
form.
<P>
"Modeless" means the modal form behaved just like a modeless form.
<P>
"Partial" means the modal form behaved in some ways like a modal form. In
certain partial cases, modal forms were modal to the UserDocument and only
objects created by the UserDocument. The modal form was not modal to the
container or any other frames displayed by Internet Explorer. In other
cases, the form appeared to work as a modal form but the Refresh button on
the IE toolbar was still accessible.
<P>
The behavior of modal forms is the responsibility of the container.
Therefore, the chart above is subject to change with future releases of
Internet Explorer.
<P>
Note that regardless of the value of the ShowInTaskBar property, modal
forms will not appear in the Windows Task Bar.
<P>
<P><h3>Modeless Forms</h3>
 
<P>
You cannot use modeless forms in some containers, including Internet
Explorer, when the server is in-process. If you attempt to use a non-modal
form, the following error may be received:
<P>
<PRE>   "Run-time error '406':  Non-modal forms cannot be displayed in
   this host application from an ActiveX DLL, ActiveX Control or
   Property Page."

</PRE>To avoid this problem, you can code all of your forms to open as modal
(being aware of the issues stated above) or you can test for the behavior
of the container, using the App object, before opening the form:
<P>
<PRE>   If App.NonModalAllowed Then
      frmModeless.Show vbModeless
   Else
      frmModeless.Show vbModal
   End If

</PRE>If you do use modeless forms, users will be able navigate away from your
ActiveX document and the form will drop to the background if navigation
takes place.
<P>
Unlike modal forms, modeless forms will appear in the Windows TaskBar if
the ShowInTaskBar property is set to true.
<P>
<P><h3>Avoiding Forms</h3>
 
<P>
In ActiveX Document applications, it is recommended that forms be avoided.
Instead, use other UserDocuments to achieve the same tasks. As described
above, the behavior of forms may make your application difficult to use or
confusing for clients. UserDocuments can achieve most of the same tasks as
forms and can be manipulated much more easily than forms in an ActiveX
document application.
<P>
If you have some existing forms that you would like to convert to
UserDocuments, Visual Basic 5.0 ships with the "VB ActiveX Document
Migration Wizard" that allows you to convert Visual Basic forms to
UserDocuments easily. To access the "VB ActiveX Migration Wizard," choose
Add-In Manager from the Add-Ins menu in Visual Basic. From within the Add-
In Manager, select the "VB ActiveX Migration Wizard" and choose OK. Now
choose the Wizard from the Add-Ins menu. (If the "VB ActiveX Migration
Wizard" was not an available selection in the Add-In Manager, you may need
to add it by running the Visual Basic 5 installation program).
<P>
In an ActiveX document application you can add additional UserDocuments to
your project. These will become individual .VBD files when the application
is compiled. You can then navigate to the .VBD files using the NavigateTo
method of the Hyperlink object, as in the following example:
<P>
<PRE>   Private Sub_Command1_Click()
      HyperLink.NavigateTo "UserDocument2.Vbd"
   End Sub
