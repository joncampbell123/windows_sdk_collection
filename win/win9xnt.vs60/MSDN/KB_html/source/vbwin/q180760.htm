The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic 5.0, version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Form Activate events may not fire correctly after a form is closed and then
reopened.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Remove ControlMenus, MinButtons, and MaxButtons from all forms (set their
properties to False), and use menu or command button code to close forms.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. We are researching this
bug and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The problem is difficult to reproduce. It only occurs when a form is closed
using the Control Menu or Window Close buttons (upper-right corner), and
then reopened while the application continues to run.
<P>
NOTE: This problem does not occur when the Hide and Show method are used to
navigate among forms.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Open a new Windows CE project in Visual Basic 5.0. Form1 is created by
   default.

<P><LI>Add another form (Form2) to the project.

<P><LI>Add a CommandButton (Command1) to Form1 and paste the following code
   into the General Declarations section of Form1:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Private Sub Command1_Click()
<PRE></PRE>         Form2.Show
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Add a CommandButton (Command1) to Form2 and paste the following code
   into the General Declarations section of Form2:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Private Sub Command1_Click()
<PRE></PRE>         Form1.Show
      End Sub

      Private Sub Form_Activate()
         MsgBox "Form2 is activated"
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Press the F5 key to run the project in emulation.

<P><LI>Click on Command1 on Form1. Form2 is brought to the front and the
   message box indicates that the Form2 Activate event was fired. Click OK
   to clear the message box.

<P><LI>Click on Command1 on Form2. Form1 is brought to the front. Click the
<PRE>   'X' button to close Form1. Form2 Activate is fired again. Clear the
   message box.

</PRE><P><LI>Click on the Command1 on Form2 to bring up Form1. Click on Command1 on
   Form1. Form2 shows, but the message box in the Form2 Activate event does
   not fire.
