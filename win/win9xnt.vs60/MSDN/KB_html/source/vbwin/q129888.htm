<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Setup kit for Visual Basic version 4.0 now fills distribution disks
completely by splitting files across disks. This article explains how to
deal with some of the issues that may come up when you use the new Setup
Wizard in Visual Basic version 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>

<P><h3>Making Changes to SETUP1.EXE</h3>
 
<P>
Making changes to the SETUP1.EXE project restricts your ability to use the
same disk scheme after recompiling the .EXE file. Use the following steps
if you want to keep the same disk scheme after making changes to an .EXE
file:

<OL><P><LI>Edit the SWDEPEND.INI file to add a key to the [SETUPWIZ] or
   [SETUPWIZ-32] section as in this example:
<P>
   USES4=RESERVED.DAT.

<P><LI>Create a file by the same name (RESERVED.DAT) somewhere in the Windows
   search path. When the Setup Wizard creates disks, it will always copy
   RESERVED.DAT to disk 1.

<P><LI>Delete RESERVED.DAT after the images are created.

<P><LI>Edit the SETUP.LST file on disk 1 to delete the line referring to
   RESERVED.DAT in the [Bootstrap] section. Then renumber all instances of
<PRE>   'FILEX=' that follow that line you just deleted so that the file numbers
   are contiguous.

</PRE></OL><h3>Designing an Installation for an Operating System</h3>
 
<P>
The Setup Wizard for Visual Basic version 4.0 does not allow you to specify
the target operating system environment. This capability would reduce the
number of files needed on the distribution disks because many of the files
would not be necessary if you are creating the project for an environment
that already carries the supporting files.
<P>
Use the following steps to design installation disks for multiple operating
system environments.

<OL><P><LI>Create several SWDEPEND.INI files, one for each targeted distribution
   environment.

<P><LI>Delete the 'USESX=' keys in the [SETUPWIZ] and/or [SETUPWIZ-32] sections
   and also in the [VB Runtime xxxx] and/or [VB Runtime xxxx-32] sections.

<P><LI>Before starting the SetupWizard, copy the desired SWDEPEND.INI file to
   the Windows directory.

<P><LI>Run the Setup Wizard. In Step 5 of Setup Wizard, clear the files you
   don't need to ship from the selection of files.
