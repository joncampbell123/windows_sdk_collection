The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation, Learning, Professional, and
   Enterprise Editions for Windows, version 5.0
   on the following platforms: NT, Win95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
VB5DCOM.EXE is a Visual Basic 5.0 sample application that demonstrates how
to use WithEvents and CallBacks remotely via DCOM.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
It also addresses all of the security settings that are required to make
DCOM function correctly with Visual Basic 5.0 using DCOM Config. It even
demonstrates how to check a client machines registry to confirm that DCOM
is installed on WIN95 platforms and enabled on WINNT platforms. If DCOM is
not present on the WIN95 machine, then it presents the user with the
opportunity to immediately download the necessary DCOM files from the
Microsoft web site.

   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Place the file Vb5dcom.exe in a root directory of a drive that has at least
150KB of available space. This a self-extracting executable so it will
create the proper folders for you and place all the files in their
respective locations. Execute the file Vb5dcom.exe. You will now have a
DCOMDemo folder with separate Client and Server folders.
<P>
Open the server project \DCOMDemo\Server\DCOMDemoServer.vbp. In the
project's properties, make sure that the "remote server files" option on
the component tab is checked and make an executable of the server. The
server will now be registered on your machine and you will have a .vbr file
containing the registry entries for the server. Close the server project.
<P>
Open the client project \DCOMDemo\Client\DCOMDemoClient.vbp. Set a
reference to the DCOMDemoServer in the projects references. Run the project
locally to check for problems before distributing to other machines for
testing remotely.
<P>
See the included file \DCOMDemo\Permissions.txt if you encounter problems
(such as Error 70 - Permission denied).
