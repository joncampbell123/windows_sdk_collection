<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When an OLE Automation client requests an object that can be provided by
more than one server, OLE uses a predefined set of rules to determine which
server is used to supply that object. This article lists the order used by
OLE when providing objects.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Each object that can be provided to an OLE Automation client can be
identified by an unique 64-bit number called a CLSID. The system registry
contains a key called CLSID (immediately off of HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT), which
has as subkeys every CLSID registered on the system. The subkeys of each
CLSID hold information for each object, including the path and filename of
the server(s) that can be used to provide that object, according to this
table:
<P>
<PRE>   Key               Server
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   InprocServer      16-bit DLL (in-process) server
   InprocServer32    32-bit DLL (in-process) server
   OutprocServer     16-bit EXE (out-of-process) server
   OutprocServer32   32-bit EXE (out-of-process) server

</PRE>It is possible (and completely allowed by OLE) to have more than one of the
above keys beneath a given CLSID. If this situation occurs, OLE uses a
predefined order to determine which server is used to provide an object.
This decision is based both on the bitness of the potential OLE Automation
client and the bitness of the operating system. OLE uses this order:

<OL><P><LI>In-process (DLL) server of same bitness as the client
</OL>2. 32-bit local server (only for 16-bit clients on a 32-bit OS)
3. Out of process server of same bitness as client
4. Out of process server of other bitness as client
