The information in this article applies to:

- Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic
<PRE>  Programming system for Windows, version 3.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following is a list of reserved error codes that may be returned by the
new Microsoft Access version 2.0 Jet engine that Visual Basic can now use
if you have installed the Jet 2.0/Visual Basic 3.0 Compatibility Layer.
<P>
The reserved error numbers listed here are not Visual Basic error codes.
They are unmapped Jet 2.0 errors that are exposed only as "Reserved Errors"
in Visual Basic. In a future version of Visual Basic, many of these Jet 2.0
errors will be mapped to Visual Basic error codes.
<P>
Because these reserved error numbers are subject to change, developers
should not rely on them being the same and should be ready to update the
error-trapping routines when the next version of Visual Basic is released.
<P>
With each of the Jet version 2.0 error numbers listed below, you'll find a
brief error string that appears when the error is viewed in Microsoft
Access version 2.0. Only the message "Reserved Error" appears when the same
error appears in Visual Basic.
<P>
When an error from the Jet 2.0 engine occurs, calling the ERR statement
will return 3000 for the error number. You can get the actual reserved
error by looking at the results returned by ERROR$.
<P>
NOTE: There are pipe characters (|) throughout these strings that act as
placeholders for context information such as column names, table names, and
so forth that would be filled in at the time of the error.
<P>
In the Microsoft Access Online Help file, use the following steps to find
more detailed information about each of the error strings and what they
mean when applied to Microsoft Access:

<OL><P><LI>Choose Help from the Microsoft Access main menu.

<P><LI>Choose Search, and search for this topic:
<P>
   error messages: reference

<P><LI>Select that topic.
<P>
</OL>Now you can search for specific error strings alphabetically.

        read-only database.
  -8221 Can't find table or constraint.

  -8223 Can't create relationship.  Referenced table '|' doesn't

        '|'.
  -8225 Table '|1' already has an index named '|2'
  -8226 Table '|' doesn't exist.

  -8228 There is already a relationship named '|' in the current
        database.

  -8262 Field '|' can't be a zero-length string.
  -8263 This validation rule must be met.
  -8264 Can't perform cascading operation.  Since related records
        exist in table '|', referential integrity rules would be
        violated.
  -8265 Can't perform cascading operation.  There must be a
        related record in table '|'.
  -8266 Can't perform cascading operation.  It would result in a
        null key in table '|'.
  -8267 Can't perform cascading operation.  It would result in a
        duplicate key in table '|'.
  -8268 Can't perform cascading operation.  It would result
        in two updates on field '|2' in table '|1'.
  -8269 Can't perform cascading operation.  It would cause field
        '|' to become null, which is not allowed.
  -8270 Can't perform cascading operation.  It would cause field
        '|' to become a zero-length string, which is not allowed.
  -8271 Can't perform cascading operation:  '|'
  -8272 Invalid entry.  Can't perform cascading operation
        specified in table '|1' because value entered is too big
        for field '|2'.
  -8273 Write conflict due to cascading
  -8274 Can't perform cascading update on table '|' because it is
        currently in use.
  -20000 Can't open this database for update.

  -30002 Name not found in this collection.

  -30004 Property can be set only when the field is part of a Recordset
         object's Fields collection.
  -30005 Can't set this property once the object is part of a collection.
  -30006 Can't append.  Index is part of a TableDefs collection.
  -30007 Property not found.
  -30008 Invalid property value.
  -30009 Object isn't a collection.
  -30010 Method not applicable for this object.
  -30011 Can't set this property for remote objects.
  -30012 Can't append a relation with no fields defined.
  -30013 Can't append.  Object already in collection.
  -30014 Can't delete a built-in property.
  -30015 Property '|' must be set before using this method.
  -30016 User-defined properties don't support a Null value.
  -30017 Object is no longer valid.

         this Recordset.
  -30019 The action was canceled by an associated object.
  -30020 Error in DAO automation.
