The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Professional Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows, version 2.0
- Microsoft Professional Toolkit for Microsoft Visual Basic programming
<PRE>  system for Windows, version 1.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Graph custom control allows you to place a legend on a graph so
that each set of numerical data has a corresponding LegendText property.
If one or more of the LegendText properties is a null string, Graph may
space the legend texts incorrectly or make them overlap.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around the problem, add a string of text other than the null
string to the LegendText. If you do not want any text to appear, you
can add a string of spaces.
<P>
Note that this problem is related to your computer's configuration. It
can appear worse on some computers, or it may not appear at all.
Occasionally, the problem can be circumvented by changing the Width
and/or Height property of the graph. However, you cannot calculate the
amount necessary to correct the problem, and it may not prove to be a
permanent solution. For these reasons we do not suggest this method as
a viable workaround.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Graph custom control
supplied with the products listed above. This problem was corrected
in the Graph custom control shipped with Microsoft Visual Basic
version 3.0 for Windows.
<P>

<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic or from the File menu, choose New Project (ALT,
   F, N) if Visual Basic is already running. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Add File. In the Files box, select the
   GRAPH.VBX custom control file. The Graph tool appears in the
   toolbox.

<P><LI>On Form1, add a command button (Command1) and a Graph control (Graph1).

<P><LI>Change the following properties:
<P>
<PRE>   Control    Property   Value
   ------------------------------------

   Command1   Caption    Create Legends
   Graph1     NumSets    3
   Graph1     Width      3500
   Graph1     Height     2100

</PRE><P><LI>In the Command1 Click event, add the following code:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Command1_Click ()
      Graph1.LegendText = "legend 1"
      Graph1.LegendText = ""
      Graph1.LegendText = "legend 3"
      Graph1.DrawMode = 2       'redraws graph to show new legend texts
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Press F5 to run the program, and click the Command1 button.
<P>
</OL>When you run the program and click the Command1 button, the graph
will update with the three LegendText properties. The second one is a
null string and does not appear, but its corresponding colored box
does. On most computers, this colored box appears lower than expected,
and may be partially overlapped by the legend's third colored box. By
changing the Width and/or Height property of Graph1, you can change
the placement of the second colored box.
