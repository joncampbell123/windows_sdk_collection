<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Visual Basic 3.0 "Professional Features Book 2" manual provides
information on the three different locking methods that you can use to
control multi-user data access in your Visual Basic applications. This
information applies primarily to the way the Access engine handles locking
for Access and ISAM databases. Notes on ODBC databases are included. This
article contains code samples that demonstrate each method. Notes on using
the Data Control in a multi-user situation are also included.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Each of the samples below requires the following constant declarations in
the General Declarations section of Form1:
<P>
Const MB_RETRYCANCEL = 5
Const MB_YESNO = 4
Const IDCANCEL = 2
Const IDNO = 7
Const DB_DENYWRITE = &amp;H1
<PRE>Const DB_DENYREAD   = &amp;H2
</PRE>Const ERR_RESERVED = 3000
Const ERR_CANT_OPEN_DB = 3051
Const ERR_CANT_LOCK_TABLE = 3262
Const ERR_DATA_CHANGED = 3197
Const ERR_RECORD_LOCKED = 3260
Const RERR_ExclusiveDBConflict = "-8194"
<P>
The sample programs check for possible multi-user locking conflicts at the
appropriate places in the code, and inform the user with a message box if a
conflict is detected. In most cases the code allows the user to retry the
operation or cancel. Note that the error handling in the samples is only
for the purposes of trapping locking errors, and you will need much more
extensive error handling code in an actual application. A short explanation
follows each sample.
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Example for Level 1: Database Locking</h3>
 
<P>
This first example is the most restrictive. It opens the database object
for exclusive use, which prevents all other users from accessing that
database while it is open.

<OL><P><LI>Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add a command button (Command1) and a list box (List1) to Form1.

<P><LI>Add the following code to the Command1 click event procedure:
<P>
<PRE>Sub Command1_Click ()
  Dim db As database
  Dim ds As dynaset
  Dim ret As Integer
  Dim fSuccess As Integer

  ' Attempt to open database exclusively, checking for locking conflicts.
  fSuccess = False
      ' Disable any previous error handler
      ' and instead, just resume next
  On Error Resume Next
  While Not fSuccess
    Err = 0
    Set db = OpenDatabase("BIBLIO.MDB", True)
    If Err Then
      If Err = ERR_CANT_OPEN_DB Then
        ret = MsgBox("Database in use by another user.", MB_RETRYCANCEL)
        If ret = IDCANCEL Then Exit Sub
      Else
        MsgBox "Unexpected error" &amp; Str$(Err) &amp; " opening database."
        Exit Sub
      End If
    Else
      fSuccess = True
    End If
  Wend
  On Error GoTo 0 ' disable error trapping OR place On Error statements
                  ' pointing to a new error handler here
  ' Once the database is open we know we are accessing the data exclusively
  Set ds = db.CreateDynaset("Authors")
  Do Until ds.EOF = True
    If ds("Author") &gt; " " Then list1.AddItem ds("Author")
    ds.MoveNext
  Loop

  ds.Close
  db.Close
End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>From the Run menu, choose Start or press the F5 key to run the
   program. Click the Command1 button. If another user tries to open the
   BIBLIO.MDB database at the same time you are running the code listed
   above, they would get an error message.
<P>
</OL>Note that if you are using the MS Access 2.0 Compatibility Layer, you will
receive a reserved error if you can not open the database exclusively. In
this case, the VB run-time error is err 3000, with the reserved error value
-8192. To trap this error in the code above, you can modify the line:
<P>
<PRE>   If Err = ERR_CANT_OPEN_DB Then

</PRE></OL>to read:
<P>
<PRE>   If Err = ERR_RESERVED And InStr(Error$, RERR_ExclusiveDBConflict) Then


</PRE><h3>Step-by-Step Example for Level 2: Table or Dynaset Locking</h3>
 
<P>
This second example, Dynaset or Table Locking, is the most often used. It
is less restrictive then database locking, since it allows other users to
access other tables in the database. This method sets the DB_DENYWRITE and
DB_DENYREAD options when opening a Dynaset object or table object. By using
this method, you have the flexibility of locking only the records or tables
you are working with at the time, so other records or tables can be used by
others who are using the same database.
<P>
There are a number of variations at this locking level that you can access
by changing the option settings.

<OL><P><LI>Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add a command button (Command1) and a list box (List1) to Form1.

<P><LI>Add the following code to the Command1 click event procedure:
<P>
<PRE>Sub Command1_Click ()
  Dim db As database
  Dim ds As dynaset
  Dim ret As Integer, fSuccess As Integer

  Set db = OpenDatabase("BIBLIO.MDB")

  ' Attempt to open the dynaset, checking for locking conflicts.
  fSuccess = False
      ' Disable any previous error handler
      ' and instead, just resume next
  On Error Resume Next
  While Not fSuccess
    Err = 0
    Set ds = db.CreateDynaset("Authors", DB_DENYWRITE Or DB_DENYREAD)
    If Err Then
      If Err = ERR_CANT_LOCK_TABLE Then
        ret = MsgBox("Table(s) in use by another user.", MB_RETRYCANCEL)
        If ret = IDCANCEL Then Exit Sub
      Else
        MsgBox "Unexpected error" &amp; Str$(Err) &amp; " opening table."
        Exit Sub
      End If
    Else
      fSuccess = True
    End If
  Wend
  On Error GoTo 0 ' disable error trapping OR place On Error statements
                  ' pointing to a new error handler here
  ' Once the dynaset is open we know we are the only one accessing the data
  Do Until ds.EOF = True
    list1.AddItem ds(1)
    ds.MoveNext
  Loop

  ds.Close
  db.Close
End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>From the Run menu, choose Start or press the F5 key to run the
   program. Click the Command1 button. If another user tries to update
   the Authors table when you're running the AddItem loop, they would
   get an error message.
<P>
</OL>Table level locking can be performed using the OpenTable, CreateDynaset, or
CreateSnapShot methods by passing the appropriate values as the second
parameter to one of these functions. This method is not normally used for
Snapshots, as they are read-only, and changes to the data will not normally
affect a Snapshot (with the exception of memo fields - see the notes
section at the end of this article for more information).
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Example for Level 3: Page Locking</h3>
 
<P>
This third example shows the Page Locking that is automatically built in to
the database engine. That is, if you don't provide Database Locking or
Dynaset or Table Locking, Page Locking is enforced automatically.
<P>
There are two different types of Page Locking when the Edit mode is
invoked, Optimistic or Pessimistic. Pessimistic Locking is the default. In
pessimistic locking, Visual Basic locks the page containing a record as
soon as you use the Edit method, and it unlocks the page when you use
Update or Rollback. Use Optimistic Locking when you want to lock a page
only at the time you Update the data. You do this by setting the record's
LockEdits property.
<P>
Page locking is enforced on a per page basis. A  page  is based on the
number of records that can fit within one 2048 byte (or 2K) block of
memory.
<P>
Since entire pages are locked, and a given page may contain more then one
record, users need not be on the exact same record to cause a locking
conflict. For example, if user A locks a record at the very beginning of a
page, and user B attempts to do an Edit of another record that is also on
that page, user B will receive a locking error.
<P>
The same locking scheme applies to the index pages. When the Seek method is
used or indexes are being rebuilt, the index pages are locked on a 2K page
basis. This can also cause locking errors, which the programmer should
handle appropriately.

<OL><P><LI>Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add a command button (Command1) and a list box (List1) to Form1.

<P><LI>Add the following code to the Command1 click event procedure:
<P>
<PRE>Sub Command1_Click ()
  Dim db As database
  Dim ds As dynaset
  Dim ret As Integer, fSuccess As Integer

  Set db = OpenDatabase("BIBLIO.MDB")
  Set ds = db.CreateDynaset("Authors")

  Do Until ds.EOF = True

  ' Attempt to access records, checking for possible page locking conflicts
    fSuccess = False
      ' Disable any previous error handler
      ' and instead, just resume next
    On Error Resume Next
    While Not fSuccess
      Err = 0
      ds.Edit
      If Err Then
        If Err = ERR_DATA_CHANGED Then
          ret = MsgBox("Record has been updated. Overwrite?",
</PRE></OL>MB_RETRYCANCEL)
<PRE>          If ret = IDNO Then fSuccess = True
        ElseIf Err = ERR_RECORD_LOCKED Then
          ret = MsgBox("Record in use by another user.", MB_RETRYCANCEL)
          If ret = IDCANCEL Then Exit Sub
        Else
          MsgBox "Unexpected error" &amp; Str$(Err) &amp; " editing record."
          Exit Sub
        End If
      Else
        fSuccess = True
      End If
    Wend
  On Error GoTo 0    ' disable error trapping OR place On Error statements
                     ' pointing to a new error handler here

  ds("Author") = ds("Author")

   ' With Optimistic locking you would check locking on Update vs. Edit
  ds.Update
  ds.MoveNext
</PRE>Loop
<P>
<PRE>  ds.Close
  db.Close
End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>From the Run menu, choose Start or press the F5 key to run the
   program. Click the Command1 button. The records that are included
   in the results set that totals up to a 2K page will be locked from
   the other users. They will receive an error message if they try to
   open the any record in your results set.
<P>
</OL>For Optimistic locking, you would want to check for locking errors on the
Update method, rather then the Edit methods.
<P>
<P><h3>Multi-user Access with the Data Control</h3>
 
<P>
Using the data control is essential the same as working with the Database
and Dynaset objects. The Data Control can use any of the three locking
levels described above, as follows:

<OL><P><LI>Database locking: Set the Exclusive property to true.

<P><LI>Table locking: Set the Options property to the desired value. These
   values are the same as those passed as the second parameter to
   CreateDynaset.

<P><LI>Page locking: This is handled in exactly the same way as a Dynaset
   object.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: If you set the DatabaseName and/or RecordSource properties of a
Data Control at design time, the Data Control will automatically attempt to
perform the equivalent of an OpenDatabase and CreateDynaset when the form
containing the data control is first loaded.
<P>
If an error occurs when the Data Control attempts to automatically open the
Database or Dynaset, the Data Control will fire its Error event and pass in
the appropriate run-time error value. Since no Visual Basic code is
executing at this time, you will need to handle any possible locking
conflicts in the Error event rather then using On Error.
<P>
<P><h3>Error Handling</h3>
 
<P>
There are two main run-time errors to trap for with page level locking. The
first is error 3260 "Couldn t Update; currently locked by user  x  on
machine  y .", which indicates that another user has the page you want to
modify locked.
<P>
The second, error 3197 "Data has changed; operation stopped." indicates
that the underlying data in the database has been changed by another user
since the last time you retrieved that page from the physical database.
This indicates that someone has modified the record (or some field of the
record if you are using a Dynaset or Snapshot) that you are attempting to
modify.
<P>
For example, if user A creates a Dynaset on the table Authors, and pulls in
the first page (2k) of records from the database. User B now creates an
identical Dynaset, retrieving the same 2k of records. If User A now updates
the first record in the Dynaset, user B will not immediately see this
change, since User B has already retrieved the first page of records and
will not do so again unless he or she refreshes (recreates) the Dynaset.
<P>
If user B now attempts to modify the first record of the Dynaset, he or she
will receive the "Data has changed; operation stopped" error, warning them
that they are about to overwrite new data which they have never retrieved
from the database. If you re-execute the operation that caused the "Data
has changed; operation stopped" after receiving the error once, the data
will be overwritten without the error being generated a second time.
<P>
NOTE: Although the AddNew method does not modify existing records, the
page where the new record is to be added is still locked when the Update
statement is executed to prevent two users from trying to add data at the
same location in the database. This means that you should perform the same
checks for locking conflicts with AddNew that you use for the Edit method.
<P>
<P><h3>Notes on Snapshots</h3>
 
<P>
Error 3197 "Data has changed; operation stopped." can occur for Snapshots
which have memo fields. Since memo fields are usually quite large, the
Access engine does not pull the entire contents of a memo field into the
SnapShot at the time it is created; instead, a reference to the memo field
in the database is stored in the SnapShot.
<P>
If the data in the memo field is changed by another user between the time a
Snapshot is first populated (meaning that you access a given record, using
the Move or Find methods or visit all records, using the sn.MoveLast
method) and the time that record is revisited or made the current record
again, the database engine will signal that your data is out of date by
invoking run- time error 3197.
<P>
<P><h3>NOTE ON ODBC</h3>
 
<P>
When using external data engines such as Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase, or
Oracle through ODBC, the locking methodology is the responsibility of the
remote database engine. Visual Basic acts as a front-end to these database
servers and does not control the data sharing aspects of the back-end
database engines. In some cases, you can control how the remote server
locks data by using backend-specific SQL statements or administrative
options.
<P>
Some implications of the Access engine deferring to back-end locking
schemes:

<OL><P><LI>The setting of LockEdits has no effect on ODBC databases.

<P><LI>The Exclusive parameter of the OpenDatabase method is ignored.

<P><LI>The technique shown in the section "Step-by-Step Example for Level 2:
   Table or Dynaset Locking", will fail on ODBC databases, with the error
   "ODBC--Can't lock all records."

<P><LI>It is not recommended that the programmer attempt to lock the entire
   table or the entire database, using backend native syntax, as this can
   be detrimental to throughput in a high-volume transaction environment.

<P><LI>Incorporating sophisticated error handling to react correctly when
   locking contention occurs is the only reliable way to allow the backend
   database engine to operate its native locking scheme for maximum
   throughput.
<P>
</OL><h3>Example Showing How to Call FreeLocks After Locking Error Occurs</h3>
 
<P>
In certain circumstances, particularly in an intense multi-user contention
environment, the local access engine may get out of synchronization with
the host (the VB program). When that occurs, the FreeLocks statement
provides a way to allow the engine to 'catch up' and clear any leftover
locks. The FreeLocks method tells the engine to perform its default idle
processing, including freeing locks that are no longer in use but haven't
timed out yet.
<P>
Below is an example showing how to call the FreeLocks method after a
locking error occurs in a multi-user system. The following code is a sample
of an error trapping routine that checks to see if a record is locked in a
multi-user system:
<P>
<PRE>Sub EditRecord(ds as dynaset)

   On Error Goto ErrLock
   ds.lockedits = True  ' Return lock errors on Edit call, not the update.

</PRE></OL>Retry:
<PRE>   ds.Edit
   ds.fields(0).value = "Something"
   ds.fields(0).value = "Else"
   ds.update
   exit sub

</PRE>ErrLock:
<PRE>   ds.bookmark = ds.bookmark  ' Cancel the update.
   FreeLocks
   tm = timer
   ' Wait 3 seconds:
   while timer - tm &lt; 3
      doevents
   wend
   resume Retry

End Sub
