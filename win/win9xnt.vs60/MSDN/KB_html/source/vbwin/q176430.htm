The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual Basic Learning, Professional, and Enterprise Editions
   for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Controls located inside two nested frames located on an SSTab control may
not repaint correctly at run-time when resized if the SSTab control they
are located on was made visible immediately prior to resizing the control.
The incorrect repaint varies by control, but ranges from lack of a border
to not being visible at all.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Two workarounds exist:

<UL><LI>Make sure that controls located on nested frames on an SSTab are resized
   before rather than after making the SSTab visible.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Add the following code after resizing the controls:
<P>
<P><PRE>      SSTab1.Visible = False
      SSTab1.Visible = True
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>

<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add an SSTab (SSTab1 by default) to Form1.

<P><LI>Draw a Frame control (Frame1 by default) on Tab0 of SSTab1 so that it
   is contained by Tab0.

<P><LI>Draw another Frame control (Frame2 by default) inside Frame1 so that it
   is contained by Frame1.

<P><LI>Draw a TextBox (Text1 by default) inside of Frame2 so that it is
   contained by Frame2.

<P><LI>Add a CommandButton (Command1 by default) to Form1.

<P><LI>Paste the following code in the General Declarations section of Form1:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Private Sub Command1_Click()
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         SSTab1.Visible = False  'this could happen in form load, or any
                                 'other event.

         SSTab1.Visible = True            'one workaround is to switch
         Text1.Width = Text1.Width - 50   'the order of these two lines


        'alternate workaround if above workaround is not feasible
        'SSTab1.Visible = False
        'SSTab1.Visible = True

      End Sub
