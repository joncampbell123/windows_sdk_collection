<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A memory leak occurs in a Visual Basic project that has forms that
are loaded and unloaded several times.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The small icon of a form remains in memory after the form is
unloaded, which results in a memory leak.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this bug in Visual Basic 4.0, use the DestroyIcon
function during the Form_Unload event to remove the small icon
from memory. Copy the following code sample to the code window of
each form in your project:
<P>
<PRE>   Private Declare Function SendMessage Lib "user32" _
      Alias "SendMessageA" _
      (ByVal hwnd As Long, _
       ByVal wMsg As Long, _
       ByVal wParam As Long, _
       lParam As Long) As Long

   Private Declare Function DestroyIcon Lib "user32" _
      (ByVal hIcon As Long) As Long

   Private Const WM_SETICON = &amp;H80
   Private Const MiniIcon = 0
   Private Const NullIcon = 0

   Private Sub Form_Unload(Cancel As Integer)
      Dim hIcon As Long
      hIcon = SendMessage(hwnd, WM_SETICON, MiniIcon, ByVal _
      NullIcon)
      If hIcon &lt;&gt; 0 Then
         DestroyIcon hIcon
      End If
   End Sub

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed
in Visual Basic Version 5.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Programs that load and unload forms frequently can cause a
significant leak in memory because the operating system will lose
1148 bytes every time a form is unloaded. The workaround is to
destroy the icon when the form is unloaded.
<P>
Use the SendMessage function with the WM_SETICON message to get
the handle of either the large or small icon and to then replace
it with the icon specified by the NullIcon parameter; in this case
replacing it with Null. With the MiniIcon parameter set to zero,
the message applies to the small icon.
<P>
The return value is the handle to the old icon which is removed
from memory by the DestroyIcon function.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce the Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start a new project. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add another Form to the project.

<P><LI>Add the following code to the Click event of Form1:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Dim i as Integer
      For i = 1 To 1000
<PRE></PRE>         Form2.Show
         Form2.Hide
      Next i

</PRE><P><LI>Press the F5 key to run the project. You will notice a
   performance drop where Form2 loads more slowly as the
   iterations progress. Press the CTRL+BREAK keys to end the
   application.
