<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
RDO 2.0 gives you the ability to handle asynchronous processing more
elegantly than RDO 1.0. Because Visual Basic 5.0 allows objects to be
dimensioned WithEvents, you can use the events of the object as if it were
a visual control, such as a textbox, rather than constantly referring to
properties such as StillExecuting.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This project is an example of dimensioning object's WithEvents using the
events of RDO 2.0's rdoConnection object. Be sure to change the connect
string and query string to correctly connect to and query your database.
<P>
The sample establishes an asynchronous connection to the database and runs
an asynchronous query. When the asynchronous calls are made, the
CommandButton on the form is disabled. The cbton is then re-enabled in the
rdoConnection's QueryComplete and Connect event. This code is more elegant
than using a timer to monitor the StillExecuting property repeatedly.
<P>
In the code below, note that the rdoConnection object variable MyConn is
treated almost like a visual control. From the code window, the MyConn
object variable is available from the dropdown list of available objects.
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Begin by opening a new project and adding a reference to the Microsoft
   Remote Data Object 2.0. To add a reference, select References from
   the Project menu.

<P><LI>Place a CommandButton on the form and set its Name property to
   cmdOpenResultset.

<P><LI>Add the following code to the form. Be sure to modify the gstrConnect
   constant accordingly to ensure that RDO will connect to your database:
