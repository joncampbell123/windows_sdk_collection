</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses three methods for sending data or a preformatted
file directly to the printer, thus bypassing the Windows printer driver:

<UL><LI>Using the Windows API Escape() with PASSTHROUGH
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Using the Windows API SpoolFile()
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Opening the printer port for binary file access
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Applications written for Windows version 3.1 can use either the SpoolFile()
function or the PASSTHROUGH printer escape to send a printer-specific file
to Print Manager for spooling to a printer. In addition, Visual Basic
allows you to open the printer port (lpt1, lpt2, etc.) as an MS-DOS device
and send data directly to it. The following sections discuss each method.
<P>
<P><h3>Using the Windows API Escape() with PASSTHROUGH</h3>
 
<P>
Overall, the Escape() API works well. The major drawback is that not all
printer drivers support it because it is considered obsolete. For
additional information on how to implement this function, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../vbwin/q96795.htm">Q96795</A></B>
<PRE>TITLE     : Using PASSTHROUGH Escape to Send Data Directly to Printer

</PRE><h3>Using the Windows API SpoolFile()</h3>
 
<P>
The SpoolFile function puts a file into the spooler queue. This is useful
when you have large files to print and you do not want to have your program
handle all of the printing. The following is a list of known limitations of
the Windows SDK SpoolFile() function:

<UL><LI>SpoolFile() is documented as being for use with local printers only.
   Using SpoolFile() with network printers results in undefined behavior;
   sometimes you may get output, sometimes you may get a general protection
   fault (GPF).

<LI>Print Manager must be enabled (in the Printer Control Panel dialog box)
   for you to use SpoolFile().

<LI>Print Manager treats the file exactly as it treats temporary files
   generated through "normal" GDI printing. This has two major
   effects:
<P>
   - The file must use the correct language/format for the printer. Print
<P><PRE>     Manager does not attempt to interpret or modify the file in any way,
     but simply writes the contents to the port.
</PRE><P>
   - Print Manager deletes the file when done spooling it to the port.

<LI>Finally, a bug in SpoolFile() causes Print Manager to cause a GPF when
   the application that called SpoolFile() terminates before Print Manager
   is done spooling the file to the port.
<P>
</UL>Despite these limitations, the API SpoolFile() is convenient and simple to
use. Remember that SpoolFile() treats the file you send to it just like any
other temporary file and deletes it when done. Therefore, if you need to
preserve the file you want to print, you need to copy it. The code below
provides an example of calling SpoolFile().
<P>
Before you run this sample, you need to have a preformatted file to print.
You can create this by printing a document from Word and choosing the Print
to File option. This sample assumes that C:\TMP\DATA.PRN is the file you
want to print.

<OL><P><LI>Start a New Project in Visual Basic; form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Place the following declarations in the General Declarations section of
   the form (each declaration needs to be on one line of code):
<P>
<PRE>Declare Function SpoolFile Lib "GDI" (ByVal lpszPrinter As String,
                                      ByVal lpszPort As String,
                                      ByVal lpszJob As String,
                                      ByVal lpszFile As String)
                                      As Integer

                                            ByVal lpReturnedString As
                                                                   String,
                                            ByVal nSize As Integer)
                                            As Integer

</PRE><P><LI>Add a command button (Command1) to the form and place the following code
   in the Click() event:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Command1_Click ()

   Dim DefaultPrinter As String  'hold the default printer information
   Dim Driver As String          'holds driver name
   Dim Port As String            'holds printer port of driver
   Dim FileToSpool As String     'name of file we are going to print
   Dim ret As Integer            'return value of API calls

   'initialize our printer buffer, call the API, and trim the Nulls
   DefaultPrinter = Space$(128)

   'the following statement needs to be on one line of code
   ret = GetProfileString("windows", "device", "NONE", DefaultPrinter,
   Len(DefaultPrinter))

   DefaultPrinter = Left$(DefaultPrinter, ret)

   'parse the printer line
   'for the port, look for the second comma, this is where the port is
   'for the printer driver, take the string up to the first comma
   Driver = Left$(DefaultPrinter, InStr(DefaultPrinter, ",") - 1)
   Port = Mid$(DefaultPrinter, InStr(Len(Driver) + 2, DefaultPrinter, ",")
   + 1)

   'copy our data file and print the copy - SpoolFile will DELETE it!
   FileToSpool = "c:\tmp\toprintr.prn"

   'spool the file to the PrintManager

   'check for errors (values in the Win 3.1 SDK help file
   If ((ret &lt; -5) Or (ret &gt; 0)) And (ret &lt;&gt; &amp;H4000) Then
       MsgBox "File Spooled-Don't Quit until PrintManager is done
   printing!"

   End If

</PRE><P><LI>When you run the program and choose the command button, the program will
   print the file C:\TMP\DATA.PRN to the default printer.
<P>
</OL><h3>Opening the Printer Port for Binary File Access</h3>
 
<P>
Using this method is much the same as implementing printer escape sequences
in a Visual Basic for MS-DOS or QBasic applications. The advantages and
disadvantages of this method are listed below:

<UL><LI>No Windows API functions are used.

<LI>This method prints to the MS-DOS device LPTx, which can be redirected by
   your network.

<LI>Your program handles all the printing.

<LI>This method is not supported under Windows NT.
<P>
</UL>Below is a sample program that opens an input file and the printer port,
"lpt1", for binary file access. The program then grabs an 8K chunk of data
from the input file and sends it directly to the printer, looping until it
reaches the end of file.

<OL><P><LI>In Visual Basic, start a new project; form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add a command button (Command1) to the form, and place the following
   code in the click event:
<P>
<PRE>      Sub Command1_Click ()

      Const MaxSize = 8192     'max buffer size

      Dim Chunk As String      'buffer to hold data
      Dim numLoops As Long     'number of 8k loops
      Dim LeftOver As Integer  'amount of file left
      Dim i As Integer         'counter for loops

      'open our datafile and printer port
      Open "c:\tmp\data.prn" For Binary As #1
      Open "lpt1" For Binary As #2

      'calculate size of file and amount left over
      numLoops = LOF(1) \ MaxSize
      LeftOver = LOF(1) Mod MaxSize

      'initialize variables and loop
      Chunk = Space$(MaxSize)
      For i = 1 To numLoops
          Get #1, , Chunk
          Put #2, , Chunk
      Next

      'grab what's leftover
      Chunk = Space$(LeftOver)
      Get #1, , Chunk
      Put #2, , Chunk

      'close all our open files
      Close #2
      Close #1
      End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Press F5 to run the program and it prints out the file
   C:\TMP\DATA.PRN for you.
