The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for
<PRE>  Windows, versions 2.0 and 3.0
</PRE>- Microsoft Visual Basic programming system for Windows, version 1.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Visual Basic for Windows PrintForm method provides a way to print
the client area of a form. However, PrintForm does not allow you to
control the size or proportion of the printed output, or to print the
non-client area (the caption and border) of the form.
<P>
The following code example uses Windows API functions to print the
entire form, and provides a method to control the size of the output.
This method can also be used to print only the client area to a
specific size and to control the position of the printed form to allow
text or other graphics to be printed on the same page as the image of
the form. The method is also applicable to printing all the forms in a
project.
<P>
NOTE: This example will not work correctly on PostScript printers.
For the example to work correctly, the printer must use a standard
non-PostScript laser printer configuration (such as PCL/HP).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Combining the Windows API functions BitBlt, StretchBlt,
CreateCompatibleDC, DeleteDC, SelectObject, and Escape allows greater
control over the placement and size of the printed form than the
PrintForm method. In a two-part process, the image of the entire form
is captured by using BitBlt to make an invisible picture, and is
turned into a persistent bitmap using the AutoRedraw property. Then
the picture is printed using the method of printing a picture control
(outlined in a separate article, found by querying for the following
word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base):
<P>
<PRE>   CreateCompatibleDC

</PRE>This method works on maximized forms as well as any smaller forms.
The use of GetSystemMetrics allows a general procedure to handle
different window border styles passed to it by querying the video
driver for the size of windows standard borders in pixels.
<P>
The example below requires a single form with an invisible picture
control.

<P>
</OL>Double-click the form to invoke the FormPrint procedure. Any form
passed as a parameter to FormPrint will be printed. BitBlt will
transfer the image to the Picture control, then StretchBlt transfers
it to the printer DC, which will print the image that was transferred
by BitBlt.
<P>
Optionally, you could place text or graphics in the picture
(Form1.Picture2) before printing with StretchBlt or print directly
to the page using Printer.Print or Printer.Line. If you choose the
latter method, by adjusting the second and third parameters of
StretchBlt, you can make the already printed content be followed by
the image of the form on the same page.
