<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Below is a summary of Application Programmer's Interface (API) functions
for Microsoft Windows that programmers commonly use to extend the
abilities of Visual Basic.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Commonly-Used API Functions for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
The following Windows API functions are very useful for Visual Basic
programmers:

<UL><LI>BitBlt: Move a bitmap from a source device context to a destination.

<LI>ExtractIcon, DrawIcon, and LoadIcon: Manipulate icons.

<LI>FindExecutable: Find and retrieve the executable filename that is
   associated with a specified filename.

<LI>GetWindowsDirectory: Get the pathname of the Windows directory.

<LI>GetSystemDirectory: Get the pathname of the Windows system subdirectory.

<LI>GetSystemMetrics: Get widths and heights of the display elements of
   Microsoft Windows.

<LI>GetTempFileName: Return a temporary filename and path using the TEMP
   environment variable.

<LI>GetWindowPlacement and SetWindowPlacement: Get or set the show state and
   the normal (restored), minimized, and maximized positions of a window.

<LI>GetProfileString, GetProfileInt, WriteProfileString: Get or set the
   information stored in the initialization file for Windows (WIN.INI).

<LI>GetPrivateProfileString, GetPrivateProfileInt, SetPrivateProfileString:
   Get or set the information in a given initialization file (ininame.INI).

<LI>SendMessage: Send Windows messages to control applications. For example,
   the LB_SETTABSTOPS message sets tab stops in a list box. LB_FINDSTRING
   finds the first string in the list box which matches prefix text.
   Hundreds of other messages are available.

<LI>SetCapture: Send all mouse input to the specified window, regardless of
   the cursor position.

<LI>SetWindowPos: Change the size, position, and ordering of child, pop-up,
   and top-level windows.

<LI>SetCursorPos: Reposition the mouse pointer (cursor).
<P>
</UL><h3>Additional Commonly-Used API Functions for Windows</h3>
 
<P>
The following API functions for Windows are also very useful for Visual
Basic programmers:

<UL><LI>BringWindowToTop, SetActiveWindow: Activate a window.

<LI>CreateCompatibleDC: Prepare image in memory, such as before copying an
   image to the compatible device.

<LI>DeleteObject, ReleaseDC: Remove object or device context from memory.

<LI>DragAcceptFiles, DragFinish: Support File Manager drag/drop file
   ability.

<LI>FindWindow, ShowWindow: Check to see if given applications are currently
   running. This is useful before you perform Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE).

<LI>GetActiveWindow, IsWindow: Find out when a Shell function has finished
   loading a program.

<LI>GetDesktopWindow: Get a handle to the Windows desktop window, which
   covers the entire screen and is the area on top of which all icons and
   other windows are painted.

<LI>GetFreeSpace, GetVersion, GetWinFlags: Check system settings for
   Microsoft Windows, such as for reporting in an About box under a Help
   menu.

<LI>GetModuleFileName, GetModuleHandle, GetModuleUsage: Get full pathname of
   the executable file from which the specified module was loaded.

<LI>GetPaletteEntries, CreatePen, SelectObject: Manipulate color palettes.

<LI>GetParent: Get handle of specified window's parent.

<LI>EnumChildWindows: Get list of child windows that belong to specified
   parent window.

<LI>GetWindowLong, SetWindowLong: Get or set window style information.

<LI>GetWindowText: Get the caption title of a window or the text in a
   control.

<LI>IsAppLoaded, IsIconic, IsWindowVisible: Find the state of the windows of
   an application -- visible, loaded, or minimized to an icon.

<LI>LoadCursor, DestroyCursor, GetCursorPos: Handle different mouse cursors.

<LI>LZOpenFile, LZCopy, LZClose: Manipulate compressed files. See the
   LZEXPAND.DLL file that ships with Visual Basic version 3.0. The
   functions in LZEXPAND.DLL manipulate files that compressed by the
   COMPRESS.EXE utility supplied with the Windows Software Development Kit
   (SDK) versions 3.0 and 3.1.

<LI>OpenComm, WriteComm, GetCommEventMask, SetCommState: Use the COMn:
   serial communications port.

<LI>RoundRect, FillRect, ExtFloodFill, StretchBlt: Perform graphic
   operations beyond Visual Basic capabilities.

<LI>SetSysModalWindow: Set a window to be system-modal, such as for a
   screen saver's password dialog box.

<LI>SndPlaySound: Play waveform .WAV sound file sounds.

<LI>WinExec: Run a Windows-based or other application, as an
   alternative to Basic's Shell function.

<LI>WinHelp: Invoke WINHELP.EXE, the Windows Help application. Useful as
   an alternative to invoking WINHELP.EXE by setting the Common Dialog's
   Action property to a value of 6.
<P>
</UL><h3>Visual Basic Setup Kit API Routines</h3>
 

<UL><LI>DiskSpaceFree: Get free space on specified disk. The Declare statement
   is found in SETUP1.GLB in the SETUPKIT subdirectory for Visual Basic:
<P>
<PRE>   Declare Function DiskSpaceFree Lib "SETUPKIT.DLL" () As Long

</PRE><LI>GetFileVersionInfoSize and GetFileVersionInfo in Windows API: Get file
   version information from the version-information resource that was
   added to an application using the VERSIONINFO statement.
<P>
   The VERSIONINFO statement is found in the file installation library
   found in Windows version 3.1. The resource contains such information
   about the file as its version number, its intended operating system,
   and its original filename. The resource is intended to be used with
   the Windows file installation library functions.
<P>
   The GetFileVersion function is defined in SETUP1.BAS in the SETUPKIT
   subdirectory for Visual Basic. The GetFileVersion function invokes the
   GetFileVersionInfo and GetFileVersionInfoSize Windows API functions.
   The following Declare statements are taken from SETUP1.GLB:
<P>
<PRE>   Declare Function GetFileVersionInfoSize Lib "VER.DLL"
      (ByVal lpszFileName As String, lpdwHandle As Long) As Long

   Declare Function GetFileVersionInfo Lib "VER.DLL"
      (ByVal lpszFileName As String, ByVal lpdwHandle As Long,
      ByVal cbbuf As Long, ByVal lpvdata As String) As Integer
