The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Professional and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic,
<PRE>  16-bit only, for Windows, version 4.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Grid custom control does not provide any text editing capability.
However, you can create a spreadsheet-style grid that allows editing by
using a picture box and a text box.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
We do not recommend creating a spreadsheet-style grid with a large
matrix of text box controls because doing so will slow down your
program, and use excessive system resources.
<P>
An efficient way to create a grid is to draw vertical and horizontal
lines to represent the cells of the grid. Use a single text box to
allow editing of the active cell. Check for MouseDown events to move
the text box to the currently active cell position, and use the Print
method to draw text in a cell when the text box moves away from the
cell. Then, store the grid cell values in a two dimensional array,
indexed by the column and row.
<P>
Code can be added to allow for highlighting areas, using ARROW keys to
move between cells, and so on.
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic, or from the File menu, choose New Project (ALT,
   F, N) if Visual Basic is already running. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Place a picture (Picture1) on Form1, and set its properties as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   Property      Value
   -----------------------
   AutoRedraw    True
   ScaleMode     3 - Pixel
   Height        2000
   Width         3000

</PRE><P><LI>Place a text box (Text1) in Picture1 by clicking the text box tool. The
   mouse pointer turns to cross-hairs. Click and drag inside Picture1 to
   place a gray rectangle appears in Picture1.

<P><LI>Add the following code to the general Declarations section of Form1:

</PRE><P><LI>Press F5 to run the program. Click a cell and edit the text.
<P>
</OL>This example is very limited in functionality. Text can be edited in
each cell but you must click a cell to move to that particular
cell. This article shows a method of creating a grid without tying up
a large amount of system resources. Feel free to add code to increase
its functionality.
