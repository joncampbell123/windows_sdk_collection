The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for
<PRE>  Windows, version 3.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Excel exposes a variety of objects which can be accessed from Visual Basic
by using Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) or the OLE control. The Excel
Chart is one of these objects. However, if the chart is embedded in an
Excel version 4.0 spreadsheet, there is no direct way to activate the Chart
using OLE automation. This article gives you two possible solutions.
<P>
When you use the OLE 2.0 control to embed an Excel version 4.0 chart, the
SourceDoc and SourceItem should contain the fully qualified path, filename,
and chart name. The documentation suggests that Visual Basic should be able
to access the Chart directly, but for Excel version 4.0 this does not work.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is a problem with Excel version 4.0 and OLE. Excel version 4.0 does
not correctly write the path to the embedded object as the OLE layer
expects.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Two Possible Solutions</h3>
 
<P>
You can copy and paste the chart object into a separate chart sheet and
perform the OLE automation with that. To do this, double-click the chart
object and choose Edit Copy. Then choose File New, and select Chart. Then
choose Edit Paste to paste the chart into the blank chart sheet. This chart
will still be linked to the worksheet data, so it will automatically update
when the worksheet data is changed.
<P>
The second option is to upgrade to Excel version 5.0, which is capable of
linking to a Chart Object within an Excel Sheet (or Book). In this case,
you would set the SourceDoc property to:
<P>
<PRE>   C:\EXCEL\BOOK1.XLS!Sheet1![BOOK1.XLS]Sheet1 Chart 1

</PRE>Here the portion up to the exclamation mark (!) is the path to the file,
and the rest of the information specifies the Chart within the Sheet within
the Book.
