The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Standard, Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual
   Basic, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
GetTempFileName is an API function used to create a temporary filename.
Although this function is supported on both 16-bit and 32-bit platforms,
minor differences in its calling conventions exist. Additionally, when used
with a 32-bit platform such as Windows 95 or Windows NT, GetTempFileName
might fail. This article discusses the function's cross-platform
portability and explains the cause and resolution of its failure on 32-bit
platforms.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using the GetTempFileName API function on a 32-bit platform, one of
the following symptoms may appear:

<UL><LI>The function passes back a null parameter for the filename and returns
   0. This is more likely to happen in Windows NT.

<LI>The function passes back a pathname without a filename and returns 0.
   This more likely to happen in Windows 95.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Contrary to its usage on 16-bit platforms where only the drive letter is
passed, GetTempFileName requires you to pass the drive letter and the
pathname when used on 32-bit platforms. Furthermore, the pathname specified
must contain existing directories. For example, examine the following
function declarations:

<UL><LI>For 16-bit platforms such as Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups:
<P>
<PRE>   Declare Function GetTempFileName Lib "Kernel" (ByVal cDriveLetter as _
      Integer, ByVal lpPrefixString As String, ByVal wUnique As Integer, _
      ByVal lpTempFileName As String) As Integer

</PRE><LI>For 32-bit platforms such as Windows NT and Windows 95:
<P>
<PRE>   Private Declare Function GetTempFileName Lib "kernel32" _
      Alias "GetTempFileNameA" (ByVal lpszPath As String, _
      ByVal lpPrefixString As String, ByVal wUnique As Long, _
      ByVal lpTempFileName As String) As Long

</PRE></UL>Notice how the first parameter is the only parameter that changes in the
declarations. In 16-bit, the first parameter is an integer representing a
drive letter. The pathname is specified by the function not by the user
(see the Visual Basic 3.0 Windows 3.1 SDK help file for more information).
<P>
In 32-bit, however, the first parameter is a string that gives the
pathname. So if you were to cease a temporary file in the C drive root
directory, the first parameter will be assigned a different value for each
case:

<UL><LI>For 16-bit:    cDriveLetter = 2 (Integer representation of drive C)

<LI>For 32-bit:    lpszPath = "C:\"
<P>
</UL>If lpszPath is an invalid path or if it contains a nonexistent directory,
GetTempFileName will pass back the lpTempFileName parameter with a null
value or with a pathname only. The return value of the function in both
cases will be zero.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.

<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce and Resolve Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Create a new project in 32-bit Visual Basic 4.0. Form1 is created by
   default.

<P><LI>Copy the following code into the General Declarations section of Form1:
<P>
<PRE>   Private Declare Function GetTempFileName Lib "kernel32" _
      Alias "GetTempFileNameA" (ByVal lpszPath As String, _
      ByVal lpPrefixString As String, ByVal wUnique As Long, _
      ByVal lpTempFileName As String) As Long

   Private Sub Form_Click()
      Dim lpszPath As String
      Dim lpPrefixString As String
      Dim wUnique As Long
      Dim lpTempFileName As String

      ' Because the C:\windows directory, probably, doesn't exist,
      ' using this line will cause the problem to occur:
      lpszPath = "C:\windows"     ' Line A

      ' To resolve the problem, change the previous line into a comment
      ' and change the following line from a comment into an executed line:
      ' lpszPath = "C:\windows"    ' Line B

      lpPrefixString = "shn"

      ' If wUnique is nonzero, it will be appended
      ' to the temporary filename. If the parameter is zero,
      ' Windows uses the current system time to create a
      ' number to append to the filename.
      wUnique = 0

      ' Initialize variable
      lpTempFileName = Space$(100)
      Print GetTempFileName(lpszPath, lpPrefixString,_
         wUnique, lpTempFileName)

      ' If running under Windows 95, use the following line to get
      ' rid of the null character
      ' Print Mid$(lpTempFileName, 1, InStr(lpTempFileName, Chr$(0)) - 1)
      Print lpTempFileName
   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Start the program by pressing the F5 key.

<P><LI>Notice how the problem is reproduced. Change Line A into a comment and
   make Line B into an executed line. Then repeat step 3. The problem
   should now disappear.
