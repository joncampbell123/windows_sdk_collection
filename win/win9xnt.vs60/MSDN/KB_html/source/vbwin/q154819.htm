<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to access PC bus devices in Visual Basic for
Windows. Many programs written in MS-DOS versions of BASIC used Peek, Poke,
and In and Out to access the PC bus directly. This functionality is not
supported in Visual Basic for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
MS-DOS did not implement any memory protection; this meant that BASIC
applications were able to write to any memory location directly, giving
fast access to the hardware of the PC, including custom hardware that
plugged into the expansion ports. In a multitasking environment it was
clearly unacceptable for an application to write to memory owned by
another application. The hardware port addresses are deemed to belong to
the system. Accordingly, applications are unable to write directly to the
PC bus addresses.
<P>
It is often desirable to port MS-DOS BASIC code to a Windows environment.
However, programs that attempt to control custom devices will fail to port
directly.
<P>
Effectively, there are two potential solutions:

<OL><P><LI>Use a custom Virtual Device Driver (VxD). It is likely that the
   manufacturers of more popular custom devices will have a VxD. However,
   there may be no VxD, or the VxD interface may be structured differently.
   Unfortunately, it is unlikely that a VxD could be accessed from Visual
   Basic as it is often necessary for VxD's to use Callback Functionality
   that is not supported in Visual Basic. It would be possible to use a
   C DLL to call the VxD and the DLL to be controlled from Visual Basic.

<P><LI>Use a third-party DLL or OCX that emulates the functionality. There
   are a number available commercially or as shareware.
