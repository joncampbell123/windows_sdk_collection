The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Visual Basic Programming System for Windows, version 3.0
- Microsoft Jet 2.0/Visual Basic 3.0 Compatibility Layer
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article documents some further installation issues that are not
covered in the ACC2COMP.TXT file that ships with the Microsoft Jet 2.0/
Visual Basic 3.0 Compatibility Layer.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Visual Basic version 3.0 includes support for the database engine that
ships with Microsoft Access version 1.1: the Microsoft Jet Database Engine
(Jet). This support provides Visual Basic developers with the ability to
create and distribute royalty-free applications with Jet as the underlying
database. However, Microsoft Access version 2.0 contains a new Jet file
format that Visual Basic version 3.0 cannot access.
<P>
To provide this capability, Microsoft created the Microsoft Jet 2.0/Visual
Basic 3.0 Compatibility Layer (referred to as the Compatibility Layer). Use
of the Compatibility Layer is optional: Microsoft Access version 2.0 reads
and writes Jet 1.1, so Visual Basic/Jet 1.1 applications do not need to be
converted even if users upgrade to Microsoft Access version 2.0. There are
some major benefits to upgrading, though, which are described in the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   TITLE     : Fact Sheet on Microsoft Jet 2.0/VB 3.0 Compatibility Layer

</PRE>The ACC2COMP.TXT file outlines in detail exactly how to install the
Compatibility Layer and update all the associated .INI files. However, it
contains some errors and missing information, which is corrected by the
following items:

<OL><P><LI>Errors in ACC2COMP.TXT:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - In Table 2.1, "Files That Are Replaced or Modified by the
      Compatibility Layer," change PDOJET.DLL to PDBJET.DLL.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - In the file names for the files that the Crystal Reports
      modification program uses, change PDDBJET.DLL to PDBJET.DLL.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - The program CRWACC20.EXE does not change the date of a file it
      modifies to the current date; it changes the dates according to
      the following list:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>                CRW.EXE    3/16/94
             PDBJET.DLL    3/24/94
            PDCTJET.DLL    3/24/94
            PDIRJET.DLL    3/24/94

    - In the new entries for SETUPWIZ.INI section, under the
      [ACCESS] keyword, change MSABC100.DLL to MSABC110.DLL.

    - In the new entries for SETUPWIZ.INI section, under the
      [PDBJET.DLL] keyword, change MSABC200.DLL to MSABC110.DLL.

</PRE><P><LI>When the setup program starts, it states that it is searching for
   installed components. Yet it always assumes that Visual Basic is
   in the directory C:\VB.

<P><LI>The Crystal Reports modification program, CRWACC20.EXE, must be
   put in the same directory as the files it modifies or else be given
   a full path to the files. The files CRW.EXE, PDBJET.DLL, PDCTJET.DLL,
   and PDIRJET.DLL usually reside in different directories. CRWACC20.EXE
   is copied to the root of the Visual Basic directory, so full
   paths must be given to modify any files.

<P><LI>The CRWACC20.EXE program gives confirmation that it has modified
   CRW.EXE, but it does not give confirmation that it has found and
   modified the .DLL files. You can verify that the .DLL files were
   modified by looking at the date stamp, which will be changed to
   the date as indicated in item 1, above.

<P><LI>The setup program has a button for Complete Installation, yet there
   are no other options.

<P><LI>If you have updated your version of Crystal Reports from the version
   that shipped with Visual Basic version 3.0, you should not use
   CRWACC20.EXE. Instead, you should contact Crystal Services to get an
   update that is compatible with Microsoft Access version 2.0.

book 2, for information on how to contact Crystal Services.
