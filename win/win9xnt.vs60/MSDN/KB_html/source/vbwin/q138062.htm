<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It is possible to specify the preferred address in memory where you want an
OLE DLL that was created in Visual Basic to be loaded. If the OLE DLL is
unable to load at the preferred address, it automatically finds a suitable
address; however, the OLE DLL may take longer to load into memory in this
case, and will consume more system resources (swap file and possibly
memory). By specifying a base address, you may improve the performance of
the OLE DLL by anticipating and avoiding conflicts with other OLE DLLs.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
With Win32, each process has its own 4 GB virtual address space. Any DLLs
that the process might use, are loaded into this address space. If a DLL
could be loaded as is using the addresses within it as calculated from the
specified base address, then it can be memory mapped right off the disk. No
relocation is required. However, if relocation is required because some
other DLL is occupying the memory at the specified base address or because
of another use of that memory (such as memory-mapped files, memory
allocations, reserved virtual address ranges, and so on), then a new
temporary copy of it is automatically made with the new offsets and mapped
onto the new memory location in the process's virtual address space.
<P>
Memory addresses beyond the location 11000000 are typically used by Visual
Basic OLE DLLs. So this is the default value of the base address that is
used if you don't specify one when compiling the DLL.
<P>
If your application uses two DLLs, you can load them faster by specifying
appropriate base addresses. You could specify the default base address for
the first DLL and add the size of this DLL to this base address in order to
determine the base address for the second DLL.
