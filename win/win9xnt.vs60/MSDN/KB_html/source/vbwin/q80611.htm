The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for
<PRE>  Windows, versions 2.0 and 3.0
</PRE>- Microsoft Visual Basic programming system for Windows, version 1.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The CURDIR$ function returns the path to the current directory on the
currently selected drive. Because the current directory is not necessarily
the directory where the current Visual Basic program resides, the CURDIR$
function is not a reliable means for determining the location of the
currently executing program. This information applies to the CURDIR$
function, and to the drive list box, directory list box, and file list box
controls in Visual Basic.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use any of the following methods to start a program under Windows:

<UL><LI>From the MS-DOS prompt, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      WIN drive:\pathname\program name
</PRE>
<LI>From Windows Program Manager, choose Run from the File menu, and
   enter the full pathname of the executable program.

<LI>From Windows File Manager, choose Run from the File menu, and
   enter the full path of the executable program.

<LI>From Windows Program Manager, choose New from the File menu, and
   create a new program item for the executable program. Double-click
   the resulting icon.

<LI>From Windows File Manager, use the mouse to choose the appropriate
   drive and directory containing the executable file, and double-click
   the executable filename.
<P>
</UL>If the program is launched using the first, third, or fifth method above,
the CURDIR$ value will return the current directory at the time Windows was
launched or at the time the program was started from File Manager. The
current directory can be checked by opening File Manager and reading the
current directory from the bar below the drive buttons; for the fifth
method, the File Manager's current directory will actually be the directory
where the started program resides.
<P>
If the program is launched using the second method from the Windows Program
Manager, the CURDIR$ value will be the path to the location of the program
that was started.
<P>
If the program is launched using the fourth method, the CURDIR$ value is
the working directory you specified for the icon, or if you left the
working directory blank, CURDIR$ returns the Windows directory.
<P>
NOTE: The current directory of an MS-DOS session does not necessarily
indicate the current directory that will be returned by CURDIR$.
