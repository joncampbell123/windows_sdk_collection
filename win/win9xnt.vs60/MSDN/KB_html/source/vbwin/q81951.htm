The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Professional Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows,
<PRE>  versions 2.0 and 3.0
</PRE>- Microsoft Professional Toolkit for Microsoft Visual Basic programming
<PRE>  system for Windows, version 1.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you set the Outline property of the Visual Basic 3D Command
Button custom control to False, the button appears to have an outline
when the button has the focus.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This is by design. The Outline property is not designed to turn the outline
off when the command button control has the focus.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Visual Basic 3D Command Button custom control has an Outline
property that can be set to True or False. When the property is set to
False, the outline does not appear around the control at design time.
At run time, if the button has the focus, the outline appears around
the control.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic or from the File menu, choose New Project (ALT,
   F, N) if Visual Basic is already running. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Add File. In the Files box, select the
   THREED.VBX custom control file. The 3D Command Button tool appears
   in the toolbox.

<P><LI>Create one 3D Command Button (Command3D1) and one text box (Text1)
   on the form (Form1).

<P><LI>Set the Outline property of Command3D1 to False.

<P><LI>Press F5 to run the application. Press TAB to move the focus
   between the two controls on Form1.
<P>
</OL>When the Command3D1 button does not have the focus, an outline does not
appear. When the Command3D1 button has the focus, an outline appears
around the control, even though the Outline property is set to False. This
behavior is by design.
