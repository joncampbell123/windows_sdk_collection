   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from
               Online Services

</PRE><h3>What the Update Does for You</h3>
 
<P>
The updated BTRV110.DLL now uses text indexes, with exceptions as described
in the section titled "Using Btrieve Indexes" of the file BTRIEVE.TXT,
which ships with Microsoft Access version 1.1 and Visual Basic version 3.0.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Find Out If You Have the Updated Btrieve Driver Installed</h3>
 
<P>
The BTRV110.DLL file, which resides in the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM (local install)
or the \ACCESS (network install) directory, should have a file size
of 104560. The previous (old) driver had a file size of 104432.
<P>
If you have Microsoft Windows for Workgroups, you can use File Manager to
determine if you have the correct version. Choose Properties from the File
menu in File Manager to view information including the file version. The
version of the updated BTRV110.DLL is 1.10.0011. The previous (old) driver
file version was 1.10.0001.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Install the Update for Single-User Installations</h3>
 
<P>
Make a backup of your current BTRV110.DLL file by renaming the file or by
copying it to another location. Then simply copy the updated BTRV110.DLL to
your \WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Install the Update for Network Installations</h3>
 
<P>
Ask the network administrator to:

<UL><LI>Make a backup of the current BTRV110.DLL by renaming the file or by
   copying it to another location.
<LI>Replace the old BTRV110.DLL file on the network in the \ACCESS
   directory with the updated BTRV110.DLL file.
<LI>Make the new file available for those who installed Microsoft Access
   or Visual Basic on their local hard drives. In such a case, those users
   should also copy this file to their \WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory.
<P>
</UL> 
************************** WARNING *******************************
Due to the nature of Microsoft Access' setup program, if setup is
run after updating the BTRV110.DLL file, the updated file will be
replaced with an older version of the file unless:

<OL><P><LI>Setup /n is run and "No" is selected in answer to the question
   "Do you want to install Microsoft Access on your hard disk?" OR
</OL>2. The Custom Installation option is chosen, and then from the
<PRE>   Microsoft Access Setup Options dialog the "xBASE, Paradox,
   Btrieve drivers" option is unchecked (or the Select button for
   this option is used to deselect the Btrieve option), OR
</PRE></OL>3. The Minimum Installation option is chosen.
