The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Visual Basic programming system for Windows, version 1.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In Windows version 3.1, if you print a Visual Basic form to a
printer by either selecting Print from the File menu during design
time or by using the PrintForm method during run time, some of the
controls on the form may not be not be printed (such as the frame,
command button, option button, or check box). This problem is known to
occur when using Windows 3.0 video drivers with Windows version 3.1. The
problem is also known to occur with third-party video drivers that
claim to be Windows version 3.1 compatible. The problem does not occur
when you run Visual Basic with Windows version 3.0.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To overcome this problem, delete the old video driver and install the new
Windows version 3.1 compatible driver. This can be done through Windows
Setup (see your Windows version 3.1 manual for details).
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem may result when you install Windows version 3.1, because
some of the Windows version 3.0 video drivers may not be updated.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 
<P>
To reproduce the problem, do the following (using a Windows version 3.0
video driver with Windows version 3.1):

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic, or from the File menu, choose New Project (ALT,
    F, N) if Visual Basic is already running. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add controls to Form1 such as frame, command button, check box,
    and option button.

<P><LI>From the File Menu, choose Print.

<P><LI>In the Print dialog box, select Current and Form.

<P><LI>Choose the OK button to start printing.

<P><LI>Note that the frame, command button, and option button are not
    printed.

<P><LI>Add the following code to the Form1 Click event:
<P>
       Form1.PrintForm

<P><LI>Press F5 to run the program.

<P><LI>Click in the form.

<P><LI>Note that the frame, command button, and the check box are not
    printed.
<P>
</OL>To overcome this problem, delete the old video driver and install the
new Windows 3.1 compatible driver. You can do this through Windows
Setup (see your Windows 3.1 manual for details).
