<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has made available to the public debugging symbols to aid in the
identification of bugs within Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0 with Visual Studio
SP2 applied. Debugging symbols allow debugging tools like Visual C++ and
Dr. Watson to obtain stack traces describing the functions within built
components, such as MSVBVM50.DLL, which are being called when a crash
occurs. These traces aid Microsoft in diagnosing problems that cannot be
easily reproduced on other systems.

   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

</PRE>To install the debugging symbols, you first must extract them from
VB5SP2DS.EXE. When you run the VB5SP2DS.EXE, it will prompt you for a
directory in which to extract the files. When the extraction process is
complete, there will be two sub-directories containing the debugging symbol
files. These files all have a DBG file extension.
<P>
The DBG files in the "x86" directory are for debugging Visual Studio
Service Pack 2 on Intel platforms. The DBG files in the "Alpha" directory
are for debugging Visual Studio Service Pack 2 on the Alpha platform.
<P>
Different debugging tools have different methods of locating debugging
symbols. Usually, you can put a DBG file in the same directory as the EXE,
DLL, or OCX for which it applies and a debugging tool will find it. For
instance, if MSVBVM50.DLL is in C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32 directory, you can copy
MSVBVM50.DBG to C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32 and most debugging tools will locate it.
You should consult your debugging tool documentation for more information
on installing debugging symbols so that the tool can use them.
<P>
All the DBG files in VB5SP2DS.EXE include only Common Object File Format
(COFF) debugging symbols. To use them with Visual C++ 5.0, you must copy
SYMCVT.DLL from your Visual C++ CD-ROM to your Windows system directory.
DRWTSN32.EXE that comes with NT can understand the COFF debugging symbols
without SYMCVT.DLL.
