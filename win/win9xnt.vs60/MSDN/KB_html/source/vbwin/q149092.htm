The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Standard, Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual
   Basic, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to programmatically edit the data and add new
records to a DBGrid control. You can change the contents of a cell and
those changes will appear
on the screen, but they are not written to the data source bound to the
DBGrid control. To write these changes to the data source, you must instead
edit the underlying recordset.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following example creates a simple database containing one table with
four fields and five records. Each record is a number in the field. The
database is going to be the data source.
<P>
When you click on a cell, the data in that cell is shown in a TextBox. When
you change the contents of that cell, the changes are shown on the DBGrid
control. However, when you execute the UpdateControls method through a
command button, the changes disappear from the cell, indicating the data
source was not updated.
<P>
You must click the Update Recordset button when you make your changes in
the TextBox to ensure that the changes are written to the data source. The
Update Recordset button updates the underlying recordset of the Data
control. Since the DBGrid control is bound to the Data control, the changes
appear in the DBGrid control.
<P>
<P><h3>Creating the Sample Application</h3>
 
<P>
The following sample application demonstrates how to edit the contents
of a DBGrid cell:

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic. Once it is running, on the File menu, click
   New Project. Add a Data control, a DBGrid control, a TextBox, and
   three Command buttons. Set the following properties for each control:
<P>
<PRE>   Control       Default Name       Property       Value
   -----------------------------------------------------

   DBGrid        DBGrid1            DataSource     Data1

</PRE><P><LI>Copy the following code sample to the Form1 code window:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Option Explicit
      Dim rs1 As Recordset

</PRE><h3>Running the Sample Application</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>On the Run menu, click Start, or press F5.

<P><LI>Click on a cell on the DBGrid control and change the contents of
   that cell. Click the Update DBGrid button. Note that your changes
   disappear from the DBGrid. Clicking on a blank area on the DBGrid
   control gives error 6148 - Invalid row number.

<P><LI>Click on a cell. Note that the contents of the cell appear on the
   TextBox. Change the contents of the TextBox and then click the Update
   Recordset button. Note that your changes now appear on the DBGrid
   control.

<P><LI>Click the Add New Records button to add a new record to the DBGrid
</OL>control. The contents of the text box will be added as a new record.
