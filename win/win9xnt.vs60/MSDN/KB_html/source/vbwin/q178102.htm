Make The Most Of Your Data Choices - This primer gives you the scoop on
what you can do with today's data architectures, including Data Access
Objects (DAO), Remote Data Objects (RDO), ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), and
the Open Database Connectivity application programming interface (ODBC
API). By Ward Hitt.
<P>
Give Your Data A Makeover - Use the most appropriate user interface (UI)
design for the type of database application you're writing. No single UI
serves every database app or form you create. Rather, create your UI based
on the category of database functionality your app provides.
By Joel Garcia.
<P>
Use A Dll For Practical Internet Transfers - Create effective, custom
Internet applications without third-party controls using a "virtual modem"
DLL. You'll create an Internet "chat" application to demonstrate how your
applications can transfer files and pictures over the Internet.
By Ron Schwarz.
<P>
Program With Events - Use VB5's new keyword, WithEvents, to handle events
generated by an object. The object can be a form, any control on a form, an
object you create from a class, or any database that generates events.
Trust us: it'll make your life easier. By Deborah Kurata.
<P>

(MTS) might not have all the pieces in place, but it's stable enough to use

debugging. By Jonathan Zuck.
