The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Professional and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic,
   16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After placing a DBList control onto a SSPanel with the AutoSize property
set to '3 - AutoSize child sized to panel,' the DBList control flashes
continuously.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
A combination of the DBList control and SSPanel with AutoSize set to 3 will
always cause this problem. It will not occur if the SSPanel's AutoSize
property is anything other than '3 - AutoSize child sized to panel.'
<P>
Note that a primary use for setting AutoSize to 3 was to give "a three-
dimensional look to standard controls such as list boxes." In this case,
there is no need to use a 3D panel, because the DBList control has an
Appearance property and a 3D look can be achieved solely by setting this
property.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a issue in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of the article. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>

<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic, or if it is already running, choose New Project from
   the File menu.

<P><LI>If the 3D controls (panel, command button, etc.) are not in the Toolbox,
   right-click the Toolbox and select 'Custom Controls' from the
   pop-up menu. In the Custom Controls dialog box, double-click the
   entry labeled 'Sheridan 3D Controls' and click OK to add all of the 3D
   controls.

<P><LI>Double-click the SSPanel button in the Toolbox to add a SSPanel to the
   form. Resizing the panel to a larger size will make it easier to perform
   the next step.

<P><LI>Add a DBList control to the form as a child of the SSPanel by clicking
   the DBList button in the Toolbox and dragging the DBList on top of the
   SSPanel.

<P><LI>Click and select the SSPanel control, and change the AutoSize property
   to '3 - AutoSize child sized to panel'. The DBList control will resize
   itself and then start flashing. The SSPanel control can be selected in
   the Properties window and its AutoSize property changed to any value
   outside of 3 to stop this behavior.
