The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Professional Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows,
   versions 2.0 and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Files used with the Setup Kit must be decompressed or compressed by using
COMPRESS -r &lt;filename&gt;. The following error can occur if you use a method
other than COMPRESS -r to create a file with an underscore as the last
character:
<P>
<PRE>   Error - Could not execute: SETUP1.EX 2

</PRE>However, VER.DLL must be named VER.DL_ on the setup disk and must not be
compressed.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The filename listed in the error message above can be different from
SETUP1.EX if you customized the Setup Kit.
<P>
The following two commands both create a file named SETUP1.EX_, but they
are not equivalent:
<P>
<PRE>   COMPRESS -r SETUP1.EXE             (correct)
   COMPRESS SETUP1.EXE SETUP1.EX_     (incorrect)

</PRE>The COMPRESS.EXE option -r compresses a file, replaces the last character
of the filename with an underscore (_), and stores the replaced character
in the compressed file. When the Setup Kit uses VER.DLL to decompress a
file, VER.DLL reads the character from the file and restores the file to
its original name.
<P>
If you create a file with an underscore as the last character without
using COMPRESS -r, VER.DLL renames the file by removing the underscore.
For example, SETUP1.EX_ becomes SETUP1.EX.
<P>
NOTE: If you create a custom setup, the default SETUP.LST will not include
VER.DLL (or more precisely VER.DL_) as a file to copy. Ensure that you do
copy the .DLL file. You will want to make sure it is there in all cases.
