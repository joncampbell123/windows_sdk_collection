The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Professional Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows,
<PRE>  version 3.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Some Pen Windows operating systems allow the rotation of the screen from O
to 270 degrees to allow for greater comfort for the user's hand.
Unfortunately, there is no straightforward way to use this capability from
within a Visual Basic program.
<P>
However, if you change some settings in the SYSTEM.INI file, you may be
able to rotate your application relative to the screen. The SYSTEM.INI file
contains the information that Pen Windows operating system looks at as it
loads the display drivers.
<P>
NOTE: The Professional Edition of Visual Basic version 3.0 for Windows has
the Pen Controls, which you can use to create Pen Windows applications. The
Pen Windows operating system is required to load these controls and use
them in your applications. Therefore, the sample code shown in the More
Information section below requires that you have both the Professional
Edition of Visual Basic version 3.0 for Windows and the Pen Windows
operating system, which is available through Original Equipment
Manufacturers (OEMs).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Applicable Settings in the SYSTEM.INI File</h3>
 
<P>
The following entries in SYSTEM.INI relate to the display orientation and
rotation:
<P>
[boot]
display.drv=vgap.drv  ' Sets the video driver that supports inking.
<P>
[Display Driver]
DisplayOrientation=n  ' Specifies the tablet orientation. The value
<PRE>                      ' of n is the number of times the screen and
                      ' tablet have been rotated 90 degrees
                      ' counterclockwise (default is zero).

</PRE>OrientatableDrivers={list of drivers}
<PRE>                      ' Specifies on a single line, the path to the
                      ' rotatable screen drivers.

</PRE>OrientatableDrivers=driver1,driver2,driver3,driver4
<PRE>                      ' Each driver in the line represents the driver
                      ' for 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees right, in that
                      ' order.

</PRE>Using the API calls GetPrivateProfileString, WritePrivateProfileString and
ExitWindows, you can change the display orientation by using the sample
code listed below.
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Instructions for Creating the Program</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start a new project in Visual Basic. This creates Form1 by default.

<P><LI>Copy and paste the sample code (listed below) into a text document by
   using an editor such as NOTEPAD.EXE.

<P><LI>Review the code in the file line by line. As instructed by the comments
   in the code, change each of the long continued lines of code into one,
   single line of code.

<P><LI>Save the file as a text file with the name PEN.FRM.

<P><LI>Start Visual Basic. Choose the Remove File option from the File menu,
   and remove the default Form1.FRM already in the project.

<P><LI>Choose Add File from the File menu, and add the PEN.FRM file to your
   project.

<P><LI>Choose Project from the Options menu, and select Form1 for the Start Up
   Form in the dialog box.

<P><LI>Run the program. Click the various command buttons to get the different
   rotations written on the buttons.
<P>
