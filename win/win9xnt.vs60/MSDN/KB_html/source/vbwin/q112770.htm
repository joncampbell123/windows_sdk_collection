The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for
<PRE>  Windows, version 3.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If a copy of an executable is running on your computer, and you try to
create a new executable with the same name, you'll receive this error:
<P>
<PRE>   Wrong version of runtime DLL.

</PRE>followed by another error:
<P>
<PRE>   Unexpected error quitting.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error is caused by the fact that Windows doesn't load a new copy of a
module if it thinks the module is already in memory. Because one instance
of your .EXE file is running already, attempting to run the re-compiled
version really just increments the usage count of the .EXE that is already
running.
<P>
The Visual Basic error occurs because VBRUN300.DLL tries to open the .EXE
file and read resources out of it. But the .EXE file you're reading from is
different from the .EXE file that is actually running (because you did a
<PRE>'Make EXE' over the old one), so VBRUN300 has problems. It signals with the
</PRE>"Wrong version of run-time DLL" error. It reports this error because it is
under the assumption that because it could not read the .EXE file, it
doesn't have the correct version of VBRUN needed to execute that .EXE file.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around the problem, either rename the .EXE when you create a new
executable, or exit from the executable that is currently running.
