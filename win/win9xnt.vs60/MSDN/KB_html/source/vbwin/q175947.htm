<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The purpose of this paper is to help customers decide which Visual Basic
data access interface makes sense now, and in the future for any given
application. This paper is split into two parts to address these issues
separately. It is clear that there are plenty of "right" solutions from
which to choose. The real question is, which does the job today and best
positions your team and application for what is coming in the future?
Developers find it especially difficult to work with future solutions that
don't meet today's real problems. Fortunately, Visual Basic developers do
not have to take that course when deciding among today's solutions.
