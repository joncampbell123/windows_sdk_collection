The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Professional Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Performing an AddNew and then and Update method on a table or dynaset
causes the Jet database engine to allocate a small amount of memory that is
not released until the Jet database engine is unloaded from memory.
Therefore, programs that perform many Updates over a long period of time
without unloading the Jet database engine will eventually result in an "Out
of Memory" error.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two possible workarounds:
<P>
Update Vbdb300.dll to version 3.00.0530, dated 1 Feb 95 by downloading
Vbdb300.exe. You can find Vbdb300.exe, a self-extracting file, on these
services:

   TITLE     : How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from
               Online Services

   NOTE: This version of the Vbdb300.dll does require the VB/Access
   compatibility layer (Comlyr.exe) and the updated Jet engine in the
   Access Service Pack (Accsvc.exe in the GO MSACCESS forum).

</PRE>-OR-
<P>
Periodically shell to another Visual Basic program that does not use the
Jet database engine to unload the database application. This will cause all
of the memory held by the Jet database engine to be released back to the
system. You can then restart your application from the non-database
program.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This bug in Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows version 3.0 was corrected
with Vbdb300.dll version 3.00.0530 dated 1 Feb 95.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is not corrected by using the Microsoft Access 2.0/Visual
Basic 3.0 Compatibility Layer; nor is it corrected by using the Microsoft
Access version 2.0 Service Pack.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Behavior</h3>
 
<P>
NOTE: You will need the older version 3.00.0529 of Vbdb300.dll and the
Professional Edition of Visual Basic to reproduce the problem outlined
below.

<OL><P><LI>Create a new project. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add a label control to Form1.

<P><LI>Enter the following code for Form1:
<P>
<PRE>   'Enter the following lines as one line
   Declare Function GetFreeSpace Lib "kernel" (ByVal flag As Integer) _
      As Long

   Sub Form_Activate ()

   been allocated from the global memory heap. This memory is not recovered
   until you exit from Visual Basic.
