The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Professional and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic,
   16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Changing the value of the SeeThru property of the Graph control has no
effect on the behavior of the control.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The SeeThru property of the Graph control is present but it was not
implemented in the Graph16.OCX or the Graph32.OCX controls. It was provided
in the .VBX version of the Graph control so that the control could be
placed on top of other controls. The primary reason for doing this was to
allow a PictureBox control to provide a background for the graph. The
Visual Basic development team did not think this was appropriate for an
.OCX control, so this functionality was intentionally omitted. This change
was not noted in the documentation for Visual Basic 4.0. The SeeThru
property was retained to provide backward compatibility only.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
There is no known workaround at this time.
