<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Solely declaring and calling the Unicode versions of 32-bit API functions
in the same way that the ANSI versions are used will not work. This article
shows one way that the Unicode version of an API function can be used
without the need to create a type library.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Visual Basic 4.0, like Windows NT, is based internally on the double-byte
Unicode standard. However, Visual Basic 4.0 assumes that the world outside
of itself still uses the single-byte ANSI model. Any strings passed as
parameters to an external function will be converted by Visual Basic from
their internal Unicode representation to an ANSI representation before the
call to the function is made. In the same way, all strings that return to
Visual Basic from an external function are assumed to be in an ANSI
representation, and Visual Basic will attempt to make the conversion to a
Unicode representation for internal use. This behavior makes it impossible
to call an external function that expects or returns a Unicode string in
the same way as a function that deals only with ANSI strings.
<P>
One way to call a Unicode function is to create a type library referring to
the Unicode function to be called, refer to this type library from within
Visual Basic, and then make all calls to the Unicode function via the type
library.
<P>
For more information on this approach, see the text file VB4DLL.TXT,
located in the same directory as your Visual Basic executables.
<P>
Unicode functions can also be accessed by using Visual Basic 4.0's ability
to create arrays of the new Byte data type. If the string(s) that are
passed to and from the external function are represented in Visual Basic as
byte arrays, then Visual Basic will not do any conversion when passing or
receiving data to or from the outside world.
<P>
The following code shows how to declare and call both the ANSI
(GetWindowsDirectoryA) and Unicode (GetWindowsDirectoryW, for Wide)
versions of the GetWindowsDirectory API call:
<P>
<PRE>Declare Function GetWindowsDirectoryA Lib "Kernel32" _
    (ByVal lpBuffer As String, ByVal nSize As Long) As Long
Declare Function GetWindowsDirectoryW Lib "Kernel32" _
    (lpBuffer As Any, ByVal nSize As Long) As Long

Sub mainA()
    Dim sBuf As String
    Dim cSize As Long
    Dim retval As Long

    sBuf = String(255, 0)
    cSize = 255

    retval = GetWindowsDirectoryA(sBuf, cSize)

    sBuf = Left(sBuf, retval)
    Debug.Print sBuf
End Sub

Sub mainW()
    Dim Buf() As Byte, sBuf As String
    Dim cSize As Long
    Dim retval As Long

    ReDim Buf(254)
    cSize = 255

    retval = GetWindowsDirectoryW(Buf(0), cSize)

    sBuf = Left(Buf, retval)
    Debug.Print sBuf
End Sub

</PRE>The mainA() procedure makes a call to the ANSI version of
GetWindowsDirectory, while the mainW() procedure does the same for the
Unicode version. Both procedures output the same result, although the
method they use to do so differs.
<P>
The call to the ANSI version is done in the same way that has always
existed for passing and returning strings to and from an external DLL. A
Visual Basic string is dimensioned and padded with a certain number of
spaces, and the function is called with this string and the length of the
string as parameters. After the function returns, the extra spaces are
stripped off of the returned string and the value is printed out. The ByVal
in front of the string in the Declare for GetWindowsDirectoryA indicates
that a reference to a null-terminated string should be given to the DLL,
not that a copy of the Visual Basic string should be passed.
<P>
The call to the Unicode version works a bit differently. In addition to
dimensioning a string variable, sBuf, we also dimension a dynamic array of
bytes. The ReDim statement then sizes the byte array to be 255 bytes large
(indexed from 0). When GetWindowsDirectoryW is called, it is passed a
reference to the first element of the byte array and the size of the array.
<P>
The call fills in the Buf array with the Unicode codes for the characters
representing the Windows directory and returns the number of bytes it has
modified. Remember that, since the function is returning Unicode info, each
character will take two bytes to store. For example, if your Windows
directory is 'C:\WINNT' then Buf(0) will be 67 and Buf(1) will be 0, Buf(2)
will be 58, while Buf(3) is 0, and so on. The values may differ if a non-
English code page is used.
<P>
The line of code immediately following the call to GetWindowsDirectoryW
uses Visual Basic 4.0's byte array-string coercion features to coerce the
byte array into a string. When assigning a byte array to a string Visual
Basic assumes that the information stored in the byte array is in a Unicode
format. From then on, the sBuf variable holds a Visual Basic string
representing the current Windows directory and can be manipulated as such.
<P>
The example above shows how to pass an uninitialized and empty byte array
to a function. A byte array initialized with some string can also be passed
to an external function. For example, the following code snippet declares,
initializes, and passes a byte array to a function called MyPassFunction:
<P>
<PRE>   Dim bArray() As Byte
   bArray = "Hello" &amp; vbNullChar
   MyPassFunction bArray(0)
</PRE>
