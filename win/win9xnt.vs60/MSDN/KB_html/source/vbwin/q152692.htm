The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic,
   16-bit only, for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If a control is placed on a Sheridan tab control, and if focus is set to a
different tab, and then the control is set to a different position, the
result may be that the control takes on a large negative Left value after
focus again switches to a different tab. Setting the Left property back to
a reasonable positive value may cause two instances of the control to
appear on different tabs of the control.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
The only workaround is to design one tab at a time. Before moving to design
a different tab, the controls on the original tab should be placed at their
final location.
<P>
If the problem described above does occur, the only option is to reset the
Left property of the controls in the Visual Basic Properties window to
reasonable positive values, and then delete any unwanted instances of the
control that were created on other tabs.
<P>
When the controls have been placed at a desirable position, it is worth
keeping a backup of the Form file on which the tab is placed. That way if
the problem of large negative values in the Left property does occur, the
original Top and Left properties can be restored by reading the backup Form
file.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. Microsoft is researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps To Reproduce the Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Make Form1 large, so it fills most of the screen. This problem
   only seems to surface on large forms, and typically where the video
   resolution is 800x600 (or greater) pixels.

<P><LI>Place a Sheridan tab control on Form1, and set the size so it fills
   most of Form1.

<P><LI>Place a Command button on the upper-left corner of Tab 0.

<P><LI>Click Tab 1 to set focus.

<P><LI>Click Tab 0 to set focus.

<P><LI>Move the Command button from the upper-left corner to the
   upper-right corner of Tab 0.

<P><LI>Click on Tab 1 to set focus, and then click on Tab 0 to set focus.
<P>
</OL>At this point the Command button is missing. By selecting the Properties
window, and viewing the Left property of the Command button you can see
that it is set to a large negative value. Switching the Left property to a
positive value (e.g. 100) causes the Command button to reappear on Tab 0.
However, the Command button also appears on Tab 1.
