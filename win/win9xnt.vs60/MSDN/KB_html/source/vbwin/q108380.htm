The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Professional Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows, version 3.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The find methods take longer to find farther records than nearer records.
For example, the FindFirst method takes longer to find records that are
farther into the Dynaset or Snapshot. Using FindFirst, FindNext, or
FindLast on indexed fields isn't any faster than on non-indexed fields.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Creating a Dynaset or Snapshot is relatively fast because of indexes.
Indexes are used when you create the Dynaset or Snapshot, such as when
you specify a selection criteria or an ORDER BY clause in the
CreateDynaset method. However, after the Dynaset or Snapshot is
created, it does not use the indexes for searches.
<P>
The find and move methods always search sequentially within the current
Dynaset or Snapshot. The find and move methods don't use indexes. For
example, the FindLast and MoveLast methods require reading the entire
recordset before processing continues.
<P>
The find methods are: FindFirst, FindLast, FindNext, and FindPrevious.
The move methods are: MoveFirst, MoveLast, MoveNext, and MovePrevious.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Repositioning the record pointer to a location far into a large Dynaset
or Snapshot may be faster if you re-create the Dynaset or Snapshot
instead of searching the existing one.
<P>
For example, you could change the RecordSource property of a data
control at run time as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   txtSearchString = "target string to find"
   ' Place the following two lines on one, single line:
   data1.Recordsource = "select * from mytable where myfield = '" &amp;
      txtSearchString &amp; "' order by myotherfield"
   data1.Refresh   ' Update the data control with the new Recordset

</PRE>You can also open a Table object in addition to the Dynaset or Snapshot.
You can use the Seek method on the Table to find a specific record keyed
by an index.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
