The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Standard, Professional, and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft
   Visual Basic, 16-bit and 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Sheridan Command button does not stay invisible although the Visible
property is set to false. This can occur if the Visible property of a
Sheridan Command button was set to false in a procedure in another form.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Microsoft products
listed at the beginning of this article. Microsoft is researching this
issue and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use the ShowWindow API function instead of the Visible property of the
button to hide/show the button. This function takes only two parameters: a
window handle that becomes the hWnd property of the Sheridan control, and a
constant that determines how to show the window.
<P>
The declaration below can be pasted in the General...Declarations section
of the form where the routine is to hide the window:
<P>
<PRE>   #If Win16 Then

   Private Declare Function ShowWindow Lib "User" (ByVal hWnd As Integer,

   ByVal nCmdShow As Integer) As Integer

   #Else

   Private Declare Function ShowWindow Lib "user32" (ByVal hwnd As Long,

   ByVal nCmdShow As Long) As Long

   #EndIf


   Const SW_SHOW = 5

   Const SW_HIDE = 0

</PRE>To hide a Sheridan Command button, issue a command similar to the
following:
<P>
<PRE>   ShowWindow Form1.SSCOmmand1.HWnd, SW_HIDE

</PRE>and, to show a button:
<P>
<PRE>    ShowWindow Form1.SSCommand1.HWnd, SW_SHOW

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Reproduce Problem</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start a new project. Form1 is created by default. On Form1 place a
   regular Command button and a Sheridan SSCommand button. Go to the
   Properties window and change the TabIndex property of the SSCommand1
   control to 0.

<P><LI>In the Form_Load event for Form1, place the following code:
<PRE>   Private Sub Form_Load()

       Form2.Show

   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Insert another form into the project. On Form2, place a regular command
   button. In the Command1_Click event for the button on Form2, place the
   following code:
<P>
<PRE>   Private Sub Command1_Click()

       Form1.SSCommand1.Visible = False

   End Sub

</PRE></OL>Run the project by pressing the F5 key. Bring Form2 to the foreground and
press the Command button to make the Sheridan Command button on Form1
disappear. Click anywhere on Form1 to bring it to the foreground. Notice
that SSCommand1 reappears.
<P>
To correct this problem with the workaround, paste the declaration for
ShowWindow in the Form...Declarations section of Form2. Instead of the
command to make Visible property false, use the following command:
<P>
<PRE>   Call ShowWindow(Form1.SSCOmmand1.HWnd, SW_HIDE)

</PRE>The button will not reappear until the following command is issued:
<P>
<PRE>   Call ShowWindow(Form1.SSCommand1.HWnd, SW_SHOW)
</PRE>
