<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When compiling a large project to native code, especially with
optimizations selected, the compile time may be so long as to give the
appearance of having "hung" the machine. Because there is no status bar to
indicate the progress of the compiler, the only indicator available is to
watch for hard drive activity, which may only occur once or twice a minute
as this is a CPU intensive activity.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is by design. Compiling to native code takes more time than compiling
to p-code. There are some techniques suggested below for taking advantage
of some Visual Basic language features to speed up compile time.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Using the techniques outlined below can result in significantly faster
compile time. In some cases it has reduced compile time for large projects
from over an hour to less than 10 minutes.
<P>
<P><h3>Minimize the Dots</h3>
 
<P>
When referencing objects in Visual Basic, you use the dot syntax '.' to
navigate an object's hierarchy of collections, objects, properties, and
methods. It is not uncommon to create very lengthy navigation strings. For
example:
<P>
<PRE>   ' Refers to cell A1 on Sheet1 in the first workbook
   ' of an Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.
   Application.Workbooks.Item(1).Worksheets.Item_
   ("Sheet1").Cells.Item(1,1)

</PRE>In addition to being a rather lengthy string to type, this line of code is
fairly difficult to read and it is extremely inefficient.
<P>
The compiler must resolve each dot every time a dot is encountered. To
write applications that compile quickly, minimize the use of dots when
referencing an object.
<P>
You can usually minimize the dots by analyzing the objects and methods
available to you. For example, the above line of code can be shortened by
removing the Item method (this is the default method for collections
anyway, so you'll rarely use it in code) and by using the more efficient
Range method:
<P>
<PRE>   ' Refers to cell A1 on Sheet1 in the first workbook
   ' of an Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.
   Application.Workbooks(1).Worksheets("Sheet1").Range("A1")

</PRE>You can shorten this even further by rewriting the code so that it refers
to the active sheet in the active workbook, instead of a specific sheet in
a specific workbook:
<P>
<PRE>   ' Refers to cell A1 on the active sheet in the
   ' active workbook.
   Range("A1")

</PRE>Of course, the above example assumes it's OK to refer to cell A1 of any
sheet that happens to be active.
<P>
<P><h3>Use Set and With...End With</h3>
 
<P>
Using the Set statement also allows you to shorten navigation strings and
gives you a bit more control over your code. The following example uses the
Dim and Set statements to create variables that refer to frequently-used
objects:
<P>
<PRE>   Dim xlRange As Object
   Set xlRange = Application.ActiveSheet.Cells(1,1)
   xlRange.Font.Bold = True
   xlRange.Width = 40

</PRE>Visual Basic provides the With...End With construct to set an implied
object within code:
<P>
<PRE>   With Application.ActiveSheet.Cells(1,1)
      .Font.Bold = True
      .Width = 40
   End With
