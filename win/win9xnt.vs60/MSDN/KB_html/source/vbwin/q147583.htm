The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Professional and Enterprise Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic,
   16-bit only, for Windows, version 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Attempting to add more than one file in Step 7 of the Visual Basic 4.0
Setup Wizard fails. After selecting multiple files and clicking OK, the
Setup Wizard displays a dialog containing "This file may be required for
your program to run correctly" and prompts if a search for this file should
be continued. If the search is terminated, a dialog displays "The file(s)
you selected were already in the list. No new files have been added."
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Setup Wizard attempts to look for a single file with a filename that is
the concatenation of all the files selected. This problem only occurs with
the 16-bit version of the Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 Setup Wizard for
Windows when run on Microsoft Windows 95. It does not occur on Microsoft
Windows NT version 3.51 or on any 16-bit Microsoft Windows operating
system. This problem does not occur using the 32-bit version of the
Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 Setup Wizard for Windows.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use any of the following methods to work around this problem:

<UL><LI>Add each file one at a time.
<P>
  - or -

<LI>Create setup media or a template (.Vbz) file for the setup using an
   operating system other than Microsoft Windows 95. If a template is
   created on another machine, then the .Vbz file can be copied to the
   Microsoft Windows 95 machine and selected in Step 1 of the Setup Wizard
   using the Load Template button.
<P>
   - or -

<LI>Add files manually to a template file generated on the Windows 95
   machine. In step 7, click Save Template and save a template(.Vbz)
   file to disk. Open this template file in a text editor and manually add
   a line for each file that you want to add. Listed below are some sample
   added FileXX lines, just replace the first parameter with the path to
   the file you wish to include:
<P>
<P><PRE>      File17=C:\ENROLL\ENROLL.ICO,0,$(AppPath),,|32760|,-1,0,0,0,,,0
      File18=C:\ENROLL\MSTRS.EXE,0,$(AppPath),,|32760|,-1,0,0,0,,,0
      File19=C:\ENROLL\README.HLP,0,$(AppPath),,|32760|,-1,0,0,0,,,0
      File20=C:\ENROLL\TRAIN.HLP,0,$(AppPath),,|32760|,-1,0,0,0,,,0
</PRE><P>
   Then restart the Setup Wizard and click Open Template to load the
   modified template file.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
