The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Professional Edition of Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows,
<PRE>  versions 2.0 and 3.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article gives the steps necessary to create a help file similar to the
Glossary help file in Visual Basic version 3.0 for Windows. It describes
how to implement non-scrolling regions that contain context sensitive jump
buttons.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
From the Visual Basic for Windows Main Help Screen, select the Glossary to
bring up an alphabetical list of keywords. You can see a non-scrolling
region with bit mapped buttons above a scrolling region. When you click a
button labeled from A to Z, you are able to jump within the current help
screen context. Several steps are necessary for you to re-create this
behavior in a Visual Basic application.
<P>
NOTE: you will need to use a word processor (for example, Microsoft Word
for Windows) that supports Rich Text Format (.RTF) files. This example
assumes you are using Microsoft Word for Windows, and describes the
appropriate Word commands.
<P>
<P><h3>Steps to Create Your Glossary Help File</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Creating the Non Scrolling Region:
<P>
   From within Word, highlight the paragraphs that you do want to be part
   of the non-scrolling region.
<P>
   Select: Format Paragraph Keep With Next to cause the selected text to
   become non-scrolling at the top of the context topic screen.
<P>
   NOTE: Non-scrolling regions cannot appear after scrolling regions
   in the same topic.

<P><LI>Jumping to a location within a context screen:
<P>
   To jump to the middle of a topic, put a context (#) footnote at the
   destination. This footnote gets associated with the footnote you create
   (for example, GotoMyJump). When you create the hotspot (the double
   underlined text that appears in color), add the footnote name
   (GotoMyJump) in hidden text.
<P>
   In normal usage, the jump to a context screen brings you to the top of
   the screen, but that's just because the footnote is placed at the
   beginning. For the Glossary Help File, the context screen is one
   continuous document which has multiple entry points dependent upon which
   jump button is selected.

<P><LI>Jumping from a labeled button:
<P>
   Do this by making a small bitmap for each letter. Enter the code to
   display them {bmc MyBmp.bmp} at the top of your topic. Double underline
   the bitmap to make it a jump. After each bitmap, enter the text to point
   them to their respective context strings. In this example, it might look
   like this:
<P>
<P><PRE>      {bmc MyBmp.bmp}GotoMyJump
</PRE><P>
   You can create multiple context strings (#) in the same topic file, so
   create one for each letter.
