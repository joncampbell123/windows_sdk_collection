<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using transactions to an ODBC database, it is possible to cause a
Visual Basic application to appear to hang until the ODBC query time-out
interval is reached and error 3146 "ODBC Call Failed" is raised. The
DBEngine errors collection will show an ODBC "Time-out Expired" error.
<P>
The Visual Basic application appears to hang and will eventually display
and error with an ODBC Time-out message after the interval specified in the
QueryTimeout property of the database object (default = 60 seconds). If the
error is trapped and handled, the application can resume normally although
the data may have been rolled back or partially committed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the Microsoft Jet Engine, used by Visual Basic, performs transactions
on an ODBC database, it issues ODBC transactions down each connection that
it opens between the BeginTrans and the CommitTrans/Rollback. It then
commits or rolls back all of the transactions on all of the connections
when a CommitTrans or Rollback is issued.
<P>
It must do this because the Jet engine offers global and nested
transactions while the current ODBC specification does not; it only allows
for a single transaction on a per connection basis.
<P>
If needed, the Jet engine will open multiple connections in order to
perform the transactions. The server sees each connection as a separate
process. It has no way of knowing that it is from the same application or
that you may want the connections to get along with each other in terms of
locking or available data. It simply treats each connection as a completely
independent and distinct entity.
<P>
This raises a problem. If the Jet engine opens a connection, begins a
transaction that affects a given page of data on a given table, then opens
another connection and begins another transaction that affects the same
page of data, the server will block (serialize) the second connection until
the first one releases the locks (completes). This causes the Visual Basic
application to hang on the line of code that is running the statement on
the second connection until the transaction that it sent on the first
connection completes. This can never happen because the transaction on the
first connection is open until a CommitTrans or Rollback is encountered in
the Visual Basic code, but that code is hung waiting for the transaction to
complete. It is hung indefinitely unless a time-out occurs on one of the
connections, which is what eventually happens.
<P>
The following example demonstrates the problem with most ODBC servers:

<OL><P><LI>Create a datasource for your server named DSN_BLK_TEST using the ODBC
   Administrator applet.

<P><LI>Open Visual Basic 4.0 (16- or 32-bit) and start a new project.

<P><LI>Reference the appropriate DAO reference in the References dialog.

<P><LI>Add a CommandButton to the form.

<P><LI>Add the following code to the click event of the CommandButton:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Private Sub Command1_Click()
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         Dim db As Database
         Dim rs As Recordset
         Dim strSQL As String
         Dim intLoop As Integer

         'Open up the ODBC datasource
         Set db = DBEngine.Workspaces(0).OpenDatabase("", _
         False, False, "ODBC;DSN=HOOHAA;DATABASE=TestDB;UID=sa;PWD=;")
         'Create a table with two fields one a primary key
         strSQL = "IF EXISTS(SELECT * FROM sysobjects WHERE id = "
         strSQL = strSQL &amp; "object_id('t_blocking')) DROP TABLE t_blocking"
         db.Execute strSQL, dbSQLPassThrough
         strSQL = "CREATE TABLE t_blocking (f_pkey int " &amp; _
                  "NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,"
         strSQL = strSQL &amp; " f_dummy varchar(10) NULL)"
         db.Execute strSQL, dbSQLPassThrough
         Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("SELECT * FROM t_blocking")
         'Demonstrate Blocking
         BeginTrans
         'Add some records
         For intLoop = 1 To 25
            rs.AddNew
            rs.Fields("f_pkey") = intLoop
            rs.Fields("f_dummy") = "test" &amp; Str$(intLoop)
            rs.Update
         Next intLoop
         'Try to update a few records. This should cause a second
         'connection' to be created by the JET engine
         'causing a blocking condition.
         strSQL = "UPDATE t_blocking SET f_dummy = 'updated' " &amp; _
                  "WHERE f_pkey &gt; 20"
         db.Execute strSQL
         CommitTrans

      End Sub

</PRE></OL>The code should appear to hang on the last db.Execute statement. Using the
server administrative tools for the server that you are using, check the
locking status on the t_blocking table. It should show the first connection
blocking the second.
<P>
NOTE: Depending on the locking mechanisms of the server, this test may
not cause a locking problem.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around the problem:

<OL><P><LI>Keep transactions as small as possible. If this condition is
   encountered, check the locking on the server and limit the transaction
   to the point where blocking occurs.

<P><LI>Use the ODBC API. If you are using Visual Basic 4.0 32-bit Enterprise
   Edition, use the Remote Data Objects (RDO) or Remote Data Control (RDC).
   Because you have complete control over connections and transactions on
   the connections, you can avoid this problem.

<P><LI>Use SQLPassthrough queries that combine the blocking statements into
   one statement that does transactions within the SQL statement. This
   could be ad hoc SQL or precompiled into a stored procedure.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
