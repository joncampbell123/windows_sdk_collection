   for Windows, version 5.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run the Visual Basic 5.0 Application Setup Wizard on a project
that uses COMCTL32.OCX, the Out of Date Dependencies dialog box displays
the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   The dependency file for the following component(s) is out of date.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
A version of COMCTL32.OCX later than 5.00.3714 was installed and registered
on the system, but the dependency file COMCTL32.DEP was not updated.
<P>
This can occur if a newer COMCTL32.OCX was installed when you visited a Web
site. When a user navigates to a Web site that uses an ActiveX control,
such as COMCTL32.OCX, Internet Explorer checks to see if the current
version installed on the system is newer, older, or the same version as the
one being used by the Web site. If the version currently installed on the
system is older, Internet Explorer replaces the control with the newer
version. When this occurs, the dependency files for that control are not
updated and the message described above will occur when you run the
Application Setup Wizard.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Obtain the latest versions of COMCTL32.OCX and COMCTL32.DEP from the
Microsoft Web site.
<P>
For additional information on how to obtain the latest version of
COMCTL32.OCX, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>      ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../vbwin/q167121.htm">Q167121</A></B>
      TITLE     : FILE: Updated Comctl32.ocx Version 5.00.3828 Available

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is by design.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Visual Basic 5.0 ships with COMCTL32.OCX version 5.00.3714, as well as its
dependency file COMCTL32.DEP. After the initial release of Visual Basic
5.0, version 5.00.3828 of COMCTL32.OCX became available via the Visual
Basic Control Creation Edition and the Microsoft Web site.
