<UL><LI>Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The example program included below demonstrates how to extract an
icon from a Windows program, whether it is currently running or not.
There are two different techniques depending on whether the program is
run in Windows version 3.0 or 3.1. The API function ExtractIcon,
introduced in Windows version 3.1, simplifies the process of extracting
the icon. In Windows version 3.0, a different approach is required.
Both methods are illustrated below.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The example program shown below displays the icon of an application in a
picture box. The example demonstrates the handling of the hDC property of
the picture box control, specifically the relationship between the Refresh
method, the Image property, and the AutoRedraw property. The code in the
Command3_Click event demonstrates how to transfer the captured icon image
to the Picture property of a picture box (Picture2).
<P>
<P><h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic, or from the File menu, choose New Project (ALT,

<P>
   Both methods extract the first icon in the file. This can be
   modified to find the second or succeeding icons by:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Storing the value of n&amp; in the Do Loop from the first extraction
      and plugging that in as the starting point of the next search
      in Windows version 3.0.
</PRE><P>
<PRE>                                  - Or -

    - Setting the third parameter of the ExtractIcon function to a
      specific index number in Windows version 3.1.

   You could do this in a loop to find and examine each icon in the file.

   The Windows version 3.0 method may take slightly longer to iterate and
   find the icon resource ID number.
