The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for
<PRE>  Windows, versions 2.0 and 3.0
</PRE>- Microsoft Visual Basic programming system for Windows, version 1.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows does not support the actual movement
of controls between forms. Attempting to change the parent/child
relationship of a control from one form to another can result in
unpredictable behavior.
<P>
However, by creating a control array of the same control type on each
form, and by creating a subroutine or function in a Visual Basic for
Windows module, you can simulate the movement of a control from one form
to another. An example of how to do this is listed below.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This example uses the Windows API functions GetFocus and GetParent to
determine the origin of the control dropped onto a form. For more
information on GetFocus and GetParent, query separately on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   GetFocus
   GetParent

</PRE>The following steps demonstrate how to simulate the movement of
controls between two forms. Note that you can improve this example by
Loading and Unloading the controls as they are needed.

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic for Windows, or from the File menu, choose New
    Project (press ALT, F, N) if Visual Basic for Windows is already
    running. Form1 will be created by default.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose New Form (press ALT, F, F). Form2 will be
    created.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose New Module (press ALT, F, M). Module1
    will be created.

<P><LI>Create the following controls for both Form1 and Form2:
<P>
<PRE>    Control          Name         Property Setting
    -------          ----------   ----------------
    Command button   Command1()   Index = 0
    Command button   Command2     Caption = "Enable Drag"

   (In Visual Basic version 1.0 for Windows, set the CtlName Property
    for the above objects instead of the Name property.)

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following code to the Module1 (or GLOBAL.BAS in Visual Basic
    version 1.0 for Windows):
<P>
<PRE>' Windows API function declarations.
Declare Function GetFocus Lib "USER" () As Integer
Declare Function GetParent Lib "USER" (ByVal hWnd As Integer) As Integer

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following code to the General Declarations section of
    Form1:

</OL>To drag controls from one form to the other, choose the Enable Drag
button. Once this button has been activated on a form, you can drag
any of the command buttons from one form to the other. The drag mode
can be disabled by choosing the Disable Drag button. When drag mode
has been disabled, clicking any of the command buttons on the form
will cause a message box to be displayed.
