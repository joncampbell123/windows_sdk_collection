<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows API provides the ability to perform a copy, move, rename, or
delete operation on a file system object using the SHFileOperation API
function exported by Shell32.dll. This article shows how to copy a list of
files into a named folder while displaying a dialog box with a copy
animation and an animated scroll bar displayed to show the progress of the
copy operation. The article also shows how to create a sample project that
demonstrates how the use of this API function.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The SHFileOperation function provides the ability to move, rename, or
delete file system objects based on the flags passed to the function. The
function requires the address of the SHFILEOPSSTRUCT structure. This
structure contains the following members:

<UL><LI>hwnd - Window handle to the dialog box to display information about the
   status of the file operation.

<LI>wFunc - the operation to perform, as defined by one of the following
   values:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - FO_COPY - Copies the files specified in the pFrom member to the
      location specified in the pTo member.
    - FO_DELETE - Deletes the files specified in pFrom. (pTo is ignored.)
    - FO_MOVE - Moves the files specified in pFrom to the location
      specified in pTo.
    - FO_RENAME - Renames the files specified in pFrom.
</PRE>
<LI>pFrom - Address of a buffer to specify one or more source file names.
   Multiple names must be null-separated. The list of names must be double
   null-terminated.

<LI>pTo - Address of a buffer to contain the name of the destination file or
   directory. The buffer can contain multiple destination file names if the
   fFlags member specifies FOF_MULTIDESTFILES. Multiple names must be
   null-separated. The list of names must be double null-terminated.

<LI>fFlags - Flags that control the file operation. This member can be a
   combination of the following flags:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - FOF_ALLOWUNDO - Preserve Undo information, if possible.
    - FOF_CONFIRMMOUSE - Not currently implemented.
    - FOF_FILESONLY - Perform the operation on files only if a wildcard
      file name (*.*) is specified.
    - FOF_MULTIDESTFILES - The pTo member specifies multiple destination
      files (one for each source file) rather than one directory where all
      source files are to be deposited.
    - FOF_NOCONFIRMATION - Respond with Yes to All for any dialog box that
      is displayed.
    - FOF_NOCONFIRMMKDIR - Does not confirm the creation of a new directory
      if the operation requires one to be created.
    - FOF_NOERRORUI - No user interface will be displayed if an error
      occurs.
    - FOF_RENAMEONCOLLISION - Give the file being operated on a new name in
      a move, copy, or rename operation if a file with the target name
      already exists.
    - FOF_SILENT - Does not display a progress dialog box.
    - FOF_SIMPLEPROGRESS - Displays a progress dialog box but does not show
      the file names.
    - FOF_WANTMAPPINGHANDLE - If FOF_RENAMEONCOLLISION is specified, the
      hNameMappings member will be filled in if any files were renamed.
</PRE>
<LI>fAnyOperationsAborted - Value that receives TRUE if the user aborted any
   file operations before they were completed, or FALSE otherwise.

<LI>hNameMappings - Handle to a file name mapping object that contains an
   array of SHNAMEMAPPING structures. Each structure contains the old and
   new path names for each file that was moved, copied, or renamed. This
   member is used only if the fFlags member includes the
   FOF_WANTMAPPINGHANDLE flag. The handle must be freed by using the
   SHFreeNameMappings function.

<LI>lpszProgressTitle - Address of a string to use as the title of a
   progress dialog box. This member is used only if fFlags includes the
   FOF_SIMPLEPROGRESS flag.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: The 32-bit version of Visual Basic aligns structures at double-word
boundaries, but some API functions, such as the SHFileOperation, expect the
data to arrive as byte-aligned. If you pass the SHFILEOPSTRUCT structure
without taking this double-word boundary into consideration, the
fAnyOperationsAborted, hNameMappings, and the lpszProgressTitle members of
the structure will not be passed correctly. If you want the copy dialog box
to contain a custom message string as defined by the lpszProgressTitle
member, use a byte array to work around this limitation. The use of a byte
array is demonstrated in the sample project.
<P>
The next section shows you how to create a sample project that demonstrates
how to use the SHFileOperation function to copy the Visual Basic executable
file and a Help file to a test folder. The sample project also shows you
how to display a custom message string in the dialog box that displays the
progress information.

<PRE>   Click Copy Files to start the copy process. To copy all the files in the
   Visual Basic program directory, check Copy All Files in VB Directory. To
   show where a custom message will display in the dialog box that shows
   the copy progress, check Display Custom Message.

   NOTE: On faster machines the dialog may not be displayed because the
   copy Operation completes before the dialog is shown. Select the Copy All
