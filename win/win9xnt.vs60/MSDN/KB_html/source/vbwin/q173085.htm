<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This example illustrates a Visual Basic application starting another
process with the purpose of redirecting that process's standard IO handles.
The Visual Basic application redirects the created process's standard
output handle to an anonymous pipe, then proceeds to read the output
through the pipe. This sample just redirects STDOUT of the new process. To
redirect other handles (STDIN and STDERR), create a pipe for each handle
for which redirection is desired. The Visual Basic application would read
from the read ends of the pipes for the redirected STDOUT and STDERR. If
STDIN redirection was desired, the Visual Basic application would write to
the write end of the appropriate pipe. An example follows:
<P>
<PRE>   'A pipe for redirection of STDOUT
   CreatePipe(hReadPipe1, hWritePipe1, sa, 0)
   
   'A pipe for redirection of STDERR
   CreatePipe(hReadPipe2, hWritePipe2, sa, 0)
   
   'A pipe for redirection of STDIN
   CreatePipe(hReadPipe3, hWritePipe3, sa, 0)
   
   'Preparing to start the process with redirected handles
   start.hStdOutput = hWritePipe1
   start.hStdError = hWritePipe2
   start.hStdInput = hReadPipe3
   
   'Reading output from the started process's STDOUT
   ReadFile(hReadPipe1, mybuff1, 100, bytesread, ByVal 0&amp;)
   
   'Reading output from the started process's STDERR
   ReadFile(hReadPipe2, mybuff2, 100, bytesread, ByVal 0&amp;)
   
   'Writing to the started process's STDIN
   WriteFile(hWritePipe3, mybuff3, 100, byteswritten, ByVal 0&amp;)
