The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Standard and Professional Editions of Microsoft Visual Basic for
<PRE>  Windows, versions 2.0 and 3.0
</PRE>- Microsoft Visual Basic programming system for Windows, version 1.0
 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to initiate a Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)
conversation between a Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows destination
application and a Pioneer Software Q+E for Windows source application.
(Q+E is a database query tool.)
<P>
This article demonstrates how to:

<OL><P><LI>Prepare a Q+E database file for active DDE.

<P><LI>Initiate a manual DDE link (information updated upon request from the
   destination) between Visual Basic for Windows (the destination) and
   Q+E (the source).

<P><LI>Use LinkRequest to update information in Visual Basic for Windows
   (the destination) based on information contained in Q+E (the source).

<P><LI>Initiate a automatic DDE link (information updated automatically from
   source to destination) between Visual Basic for Windows (the
   destination) and Q+E (the source).

<P><LI>Use LinkPoke to send information from Visual Basic for Windows (the
   destination) to Q+E (the source).

<P><LI>Change the LinkMode property between Automatic and Manual.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A destination application sends commands through DDE to the source
application to establish a link. Through DDE, the source provides data
to the destination at the request of the destination or accepts
information at the request of the destination.
<P>
The following steps serve as a example of how to establish a DDE
conversation between Visual Basic for Windows and Q+E.
<P>
First, generate a Q+E database file to act as the source.

<OL><P><LI>Create a database (.DBF) file (see the Q+E manuals for the
   procedure). For this example, you will use one of the default
   files, ADDR.DBF, that is provided with Microsoft Excel for Windows.

<P><LI>If Q+E is already running, exit Q+E. For this example to work
   properly, Q+E must not be loaded and running.
<P>
</OL>Next, create the destination application in Visual Basic for Windows.
<P>
The destination is the application that performs the link operations. It
prompts the source to send information or informs the source that
information is being sent.

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic for Windows. Form1 will be created by default.

<P><LI>Create the following controls with the following properties on
   Form1:
<P>
<PRE>   Default Name     Caption            Name
   ------------     -------            -------
   Text1            (not applicable)   Text1
   Option1          Manual Link        ManualLink
   Option2          Automatic Link     AutomaticLink
   Command1         Poke               Poke
   Command2         Request            Request

   (In Visual Basic version 1.0 for Windows, set the CtlName Property
    for the above objects instead of the Name property.)

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following code to the General Declaration section of Form1:
<P>
   Const AUTOMATIC = 1
   Const MANUAL = 2
   Const NONE = 0
<P>
<PRE>   '  Const TRUE = -1  ' In Visual Basic 1.0 for Windows uncomment
   '  Const FALSE = 0  ' these two lines.

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following code to the Load event procedure of Form1:
<P>
<PRE>Sub Form_Load ()        ' This procedure will start Q+E and load the
                        ' file "ADDR.DBF".
    z% = Shell("C:\EXCEL\QE C:\EXCEL\QE\ADDR.DBF",1)
    z% = DoEvents ()                ' Process Windows events. This
                                    ' ensures that Q+E will be
                                    ' executed before any attempt is
                                    ' made to perform DDE with it.
    Text1.LinkMode = NONE           ' Clears DDE link if it already
                                    ' exists.
    Text1.LinkTopic = "QE|QUERY1"   ' Sets up link with Q+E.
    Text1.LinkItem = "R1C1"         ' Set link to first cell on
                                    ' spreadsheet.
    Text1.LinkMode = MANUAL         ' Establish a manual DDE link.
    ManualLink.Value = TRUE
End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following code to the Click event procedure of the
   Manual Link button:
<P>
<PRE>Sub ManualLink_Click ()
        Request.Visible = TRUE       ' Make request button valid.
        Text1.LinkMode = NONE        ' Clear DDE Link.
        Text1.LinkMode = MANUAL      ' Reestablish new LinkMode.
End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following code to the Click event procedure of the
   AutomaticLink button:
<P>
<PRE>Sub HotLink_Click ()
        Request.Visible = FALSE  ' No need for button with automatic link.
        Text1.LinkMode = NONE    ' Clear DDE Link.
        Text1.LinkMode = AUTOMATIC        ' Reestablish new LinkMode.
End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following code to the Click event procedure of the
   Request button:
<P>
<PRE>Sub Request_Click ()
    ' With a manual DDE link this button will be visible and when
    ' selected it will request an update of information from the source
    ' application to the destination application.
    Text1.LinkRequest
End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following code to the Click event procedure of the Poke
   button:
<P>
<PRE>Sub Poke_Click ()
    ' With any DDE link this button will be visible and when selected
    ' it will poke information from the destination application to the
    ' source application.
    Text1.LinkPoke
End Sub

</PRE></OL>You can now run the Visual Basic for Windows destination application
from the Visual Basic for Windows environment (skip to step 4) or you
can save the application and create an .EXE file and run that from
Windows (continue to step 1):

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu, save the Form and Project using the name
   CLIENT.

<P><LI>From the File menu, choose Make an EXE File, and name it CLIENT.EXE.

<P><LI>Exit Visual Basic for Windows.

<P><LI>Run the application (from Windows if an .EXE file, or from the Run
   menu if from the Visual Basic for Windows environment). Form1 of
   the destination application will be loaded and Q+E will automatically
   be started with the database file ADDR.DBF loaded.

<P><LI>Make sure that the main title bar in Q+E reads "Q + E," NOT
   "Q + E - ADDR.DBF." If the title bar is incorrect, then from the
   Window menu of Q+E, choose Arrange All.
<P>
</OL>You can now experiment with DDE between Visual Basic for Windows and Q+E
for Windows:

<OL><P><LI>Try typing some text in R1C1 (the cell that holds the name "Tyler")
   in the Q+E spreadsheet and then choose the Request button. The text
   will appear in the Visual Basic for Windows text box.

<P><LI>Choose the Automatic Link button and then type some more text in
   R1C1 of the Q+E spreadsheet. The text is automatically updated
   in the Visual Basic for Windows text box.

<P><LI>Type some text in the text box in the Visual Basic for Windows
   application and choose the Poke button. The text is sent to R1C1 in
   the Q+E spreadsheet.
<P>
</OL>Note that if you do not have the Allow Editing option checked on
the Edit menu in Q+E, you will not be able to change the contents of
the Q+E spreadsheet. This may prevent some DDE operations. For
example, attempting to LinkPoke to Q+E from Visual Basic for Windows
when the Allow Editing option is not chosen will cause the program to
crash and result in a "Foreign application won't perform DDE method or
operation" error message. Attempting to change the contents of the
spreadsheet from Q+E will result in a "Use the allow editing command
before making changes" error message. From the Edit menu of Q+E,
choose Allow Editing to enable this option. When viewed from the Edit
menu, Allow Editing should have a check mark next to it when enabled.
<P>
You can also establish DDE between applications at design time. For
more information, see the Communicating with Other Applications chapter of
the "Microsoft Visual Basic:
Programmer's Guide."
