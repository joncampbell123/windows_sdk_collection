<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Visual Basic programming system for Windows,
<PRE>  versions 2.0 and 3.0
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
An Overflow error results if you attempt to set CurrentX or CurrentY
to a value greater than 32,767 while the current ScaleMode is set to
Twips. When using another ScaleMode such as pixels, the same problem
occurs if the conversion of the CurrentX or CurrentY value to twips
is greater than 32,767.
<P>
However, when you use the Print method (or other graphics method) you
can correctly cause the value of CurrentX or CurrentY to exceed 32,767
when the ScaleMode is set to twips.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When CurrentX or CurrentY is set explicitly, Visual Basic incorrectly
converts the value using the current scale mode to twips. If the result
of the conversion to twips is greater the 32,767, an Overflow error
occurs. For example, if the ScaleMode is set to Pixels, CurrentX and
CurrentY cannot exceed approximately 2731 pixels if the twips per pixel
ratio is 12 because 12 times 2731 is 32,772 which is greater than 32767.
<P>
When setting CurrentX or CurrentY, Visual Basic should convert the
value using the current ScaleMode to pixels rather than twips before
comparing the result to 32,767. As a result of this bug, CurrentX and
CurrentY are each restricted to a limit 12-14 times smaller (depending on
TwipsPerPixelX or TwipsPerPixelY) than they should be.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around the problem, call the Windows API functions:

<UL><LI>Call TextOut to control the position of text in a picture box or a form.
<LI>Call MoveTo and LineTo to control the position of a line.
<LI>Call other appropriate Windows API functions to position the output for
   other graphics methods such as the circle method.
<P>
</UL>An example is shown in the MORE INFORMATION section below.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed
at the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual
Basic version 4.0.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Because the ratio of twips per pixel varies from one device (or screen
resolution) to another, you will need to calculate the limit for the device
you are using. To calculate the exact pixel limit of CurrentX, divide 32768
by Screen.TwipsPerPixelX. To calculate the limit of CurrentY, divide 32768
by Screen.TwipsPerPixelY. To find the limit of CurrentX and CurrentY for
your printer, use the Printer object in place of the Screen object in the
calculations above.
<P>
<P><h3>Example for Using API Calls as Workaround</h3>
 
<P>
The following example shows how to use the three API calls TextOut, MoveTo,
and LineTo to work around the problem. Note that when you call Windows API
functions to print or draw, all X and Y coordinates are measured in pixels
regardless of the current ScaleMode setting.

<OL><P><LI>Start Visual Basic or from the File menu, choose New Project (ALT, F, N)
   if Visual Basic is already running. Form1 is created by default.

<P><LI>Add the following declarations to the General section of Form1:
<P>
<PRE>   ' Enter the following Declare statement on one, single line:
   Declare Function TextOut Lib "GDI" (ByVal hDC As Integer,
      ByVal X As Integer, ByVal Y As Integer, ByVal lpString As String,
      ByVal nCount As Integer) As Integer

   ' Enter the following Declare statement on one, single line:
   Declare Function MoveTo Lib "GDI" (ByVal hDC As Integer,
      ByVal X As Integer, ByVal Y As Integer) As Long

   ' Enter the following Declare statement on one, single line:
   Declare Function LineTo Lib "GDI" (ByVal hDC As Integer,
      ByVal X As Integer, ByVal Y As Integer) As Integer

</PRE><P><LI>Add the following code to the Form_Click event:
<P>
<PRE>   Sub Form_Click ()
      X1% = 100
      Y1% = 100
      X2 %= 200
      Y2 %= 200

      retvaL&amp; = TextOut(FORM1.hDC, 100, 100, "ONE LINE", 8)

      retvaL&amp; = MoveTo(FORM1.hDC, X1%, Y1%)

      retvaL&amp; = LineTo(FORM1.hDC, X2%, Y2%)

   End Sub

</PRE><P><LI>From the Run menu, choose start (ALT, R, S), or press the F5 key to run
   the program.

<P><LI>Click the form, and you will see the words "ONE LINE" on the form and a
   diagonal line from the upper left to the lower right. The line starts
   at the X1 and Y1 coordinates given in the MoveTo API call and ends at
   the X2 and  Y2 coordinates given in the LineTo API call. The words
   "ONE LINE" should appear 100 pixels from the top and 100 pixels from the
   left. Note that TextOut may be used without MoveTo because TextOut gives
   its own coordinates. However using LineTo without using MoveTo results
   in a line stating from the current output position.
