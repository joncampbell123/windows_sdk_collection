<P>
</OL>a. Verify that your cables are in good working condition, and connected 
<PRE>   properly. If you are using an internal or external modem, verify that 
   the  end of your modem cable is connected to a telephone service jack 
   in the wall.

</PRE></OL>b. Verify that all cable connections are secure.

c. Verify that your phone cable is functional by trying it with your 
<PRE>   telephone or replacing it with a cable that you know works.

</PRE>d. Click Redial.

<OL><P><LI>Listen for a dial tone. If you do not hear a dial tone, your 
   organization or telephone might not support this type of outside call,
   or might require an additional access code.

<P><LI>Contact your telephone company or phone system administrator or your 
   local telephone company to verify your service and proper setup.
<P>
</OL>If you still encounter problems using the ICW, view the Support.txt file

   due to updates or repairs. Wait a while and then run the ICW again.
