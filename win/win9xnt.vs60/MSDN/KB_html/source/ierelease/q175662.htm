<LI>The registry was not updated correctly when you changed a cookies
   option on the Advanced tab in the Internet Options dialog box.

<LI>Your computer's system date is set too far in the future.
<P>

   or Always Accept Cookies.

<P><LI>Click OK.

   cookies" error message to verify that you are able to access the Web
   address.

select the Always Accept Cookies option.
