The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 3.0, 3.01, 3.02, 4.0, 4.01 for
   Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 3.0, 3.01, 3.02, 4.0, 4.01 for
   Windows NT 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to view a secure Web site with Internet Explorer 3.x, you may
receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   The Internet site you are trying to view uses a security certificate
   that was signed by an unknown Authority. This page cannot be viewed.

</PRE>If you click OK, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Internet Explorer can not load the Internet Site. The operation
   completed successfully.

</PRE>When you try to view a secure Web site with Internet Explorer version 4.0
or 4.01, you may receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   You are about to begin viewing pages over a secure connection. Do you
   want to continue?

</PRE>If you click Yes, you may receive the following message:
<P>
<PRE>   This page requires a secure connection, which includes a server
   authentication. The Certificate Issuer for this site is untrusted or
   unknown. Do you wish to continue?

</PRE>If you click Yes, the Web page loads normally.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur in Internet Explorer 3.x for either of the
following reasons:

<UL><LI>The security certificate on the Web site is not a root authority or a
   known authority.

<LI>The security certificate is not correctly installed on your computer.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, upgrade to Internet Explorer 4.01. To install
Internet Explorer 4.01, visit the following Microsoft Web site:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/">http://www.microsoft.com/ie/</A></B>

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
There are two types of security certificate issuers: root authority, and
non-root authority. A non-root authority security certificate issuer is
trusted by, and issues certificates on behalf of, a root authority. A root
authority security certificate issuer is a certificate issuer that
verifies the safety of the content on a Web site. For a browser program to
use a security certificate, the program must "know" the issuing authority.
In Internet Explorer versions 3.x, 4.0, and 4.01, a group of authorities
are "known" by default. New authorities may be added according to the
issuing software.
