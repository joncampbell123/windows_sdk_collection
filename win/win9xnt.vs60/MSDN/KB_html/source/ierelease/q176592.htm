The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 4.0, 4.01 for Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to install Internet Explorer over a network from a shared
installation files folder that was downloaded from the Internet to a
Windows 95-based computer, you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup cannot continue because files are missing from the
   installation directory. Please run Setup again and choose
   Recovery. This will download the missing files and continue
   setup.

</PRE>NOTE: Internet Explorer installation files are downloaded to the Internet
Explorer 4.0 Setup folder by default.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error message can occur if the Ie4mfc40.cab cabinet file is missing
from the installation files folder.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this behavior, have your network administrator download the
Internet Explorer installation files to the Windows 95-based computer by
following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, and then click Run.

<P><LI>In the Open box, type the following command (including quotation
   marks), and then click OK
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;path&gt;\ie4setup.exe /c:"ie4wzd /s#e /d:0"
</PRE><P>
   where &lt;path&gt; is the full path to the Internet Explorer installation
   files folder.
<P>
   For example, if the Internet Explorer installation files are located in
   the Internet Explorer 4.0 Setup folder, type the following command
   (including quotation marks):
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\internet explorer 4.0 setup\ie4setup.exe /c:"ie4wzd /s#e /d:0"
</PRE><P>
   This starts the Active Setup Wizard.

<P><LI>After the files are downloaded, copy or move the Ie4setup.exe file to
   the folder in which you downloaded the Internet Explorer installation
   files.
<P>
   NOTE: The Ie4setup.exe file is not copied to the installation files
   folder during the download.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When you download the Internet Explorer installation files from the
Internet to a Windows 95-based computer, the Ie4mfc40.cab cabinet file is
not downloaded if the following files are already installed on the
computer:

<UL><LI>Mfc40.dll
<LI>Msvcrt40.dll
<LI>Olepro32.dll
<P>
</UL>NOTE: These files are installed by Internet Explorer 3.x, Windows 95 OEM
Service Release 2 (OSR2), and other Microsoft programs.
<P>
The procedure above downloads all of the Internet Explorer cabinet files,
regardless of whether a particular file is already installed on the
computer.
<P>
For additional information about this procedure, please see the following
