The information in this article applies to:

<LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0 for Windows NT 4.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes the Active Setup Log.txt file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You can use the Active Setup Log.txt file to help you troubleshoot
Internet Explorer 4.0 Setup issues. This log is generated by the Internet
Explorer Setup wizard (the Ie4wzd.exe file), and provides you with an
overview of the Setup process, including the download and installation of
Internet Explorer and add-on components. The log is intended to give you a
step-by-step view of the Setup process, and an in-depth analysis of Setup
issues.
<P>
This article contains typical Active Setup Log.txt files, with
descriptions of the important entries. Note that the entries in the log
correspond directly to the progress of the Internet Explorer Setup
process. The log can be divided into several parts:

<UL><LI>Installing the Active Setup engine (if necessary)
<LI>Determining the existing configuration
<LI>Preparing for Setup
<LI>Downloading files (if necessary)
<LI>Installing specified components
<LI>Recording success
<LI>Asking for user preferences
<LI>Handing control over to the Softboot.exe file
<P>
</UL>Errors are indicated in the Active Setup Log.txt file by either the word
"error" or the word "fail." When you are searching a log file, you should
use "error" and "fail" as keywords. You can use the log to determine the
point at which Setup stops working properly. Successful operations are
indicated with a return code of "0" or "1" and are usually followed by
"(OK)."
<P>
NOTE: The Active Setup Log.txt file is not created when you upgrade
Internet Explorer 4.0 to Internet Explorer 4.01 from the Internet Explorer
Component Download Web page. To force Active Setup Log.txt information to
be displayed on screen when upgrading from the Addon page, add the
"SteppingMode" (without quotation marks) string value with a value of "Y"
(without quoation marks) under the following registry key:
