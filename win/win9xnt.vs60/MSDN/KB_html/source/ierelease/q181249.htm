The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook Express version 4.0 for Macintosh
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the "Do not download previously received mail" feature in
Outlook Express, mail messages may still be downloaded multiple times.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if you click the "Leave a copy of messages on
server" and "Do not download previously received mail" check boxes to
select them in Outlook Express, and the mail server from which you receive
mail messages does not support the "Do not download previously received
mail" feature.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this issue, view mail messages on the server instead of
downloading them. To do so, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Outlook Express, click Preferences on the Edit menu.

<P><LI>Under Accounts, click E-mail.

<P><LI>In the Mail Accounts box, click the account you want to configure.

<P><LI>Click Advanced, and then click the Allow Online Access check box to
   select it.

<P><LI>Click OK, and then click OK.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Preview Pane, and then click OK to disable the
   Preview Pane.
<P>
   NOTE: If the Preview Pane is enabled, mail messages you click to read
   on the server are downloaded to your computer.

<P><LI>In the Folder List pane, click the server on which your mail messages
   are stored.

<P><LI>To read a message, click the message in the list.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: To determine whether you have new mail messages, click Refresh
Message List on the View menu.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook Express
version 4.0 for Macintosh. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Outlook Express uses the message header status "r" as an indication that a
message has been read. Although this status is used by almost all Internet
service providers (ISPs), some mail servers, such as Microsoft Exchange
Server, do not add headers to messages. The Outlook Express "Do not
download previously received mail" feature does not work when headers are
not added to messages.
