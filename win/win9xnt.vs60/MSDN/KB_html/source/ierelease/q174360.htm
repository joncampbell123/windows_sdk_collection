The information in this article applies to:

</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The article describes the types of security zones in Internet Explorer 
4.0, and how to configure different levels of security for Web sites 
that you visit.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Internet Explorer 4.0 includes four pre-defined zones: Internet, Local 
Intranet, Trusted Sites, and Restricted Sites. You can set the security 
options you want for each zone, and then add or remove Web sites from 
the zones depending on your level of trust in a Web site.
<P>
<P><h3>Types of Security Zones</h3>
 
<P>
Local Intranet Zone:
<P>
This zone contains Web sites that can be accessed without using a proxy 
server (a server on a local area network that lets you connect to the 
Internet without using a modem) or a modem. By default, the Local 
Intranet zone contains all network connections established using a 
Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path, and Web sites that bypass the 
proxy server (if they are not assigned to the Restricted Sites or 
Trusted Sites zone). The default security level is set to Medium.
<P>
Trusted Sites Zone:
<P>
This zone contains Web sites that you trust as being safe (such as those 
on your company's intranet or from established companies in whom you 
have confidence). When you add a Web site to the Trusted Sites zone, you 
believe that files you download or run from the Web site will not damage 
your computer or data. By default, there are no Web sites assigned to 
the Trusted Sites zone, and the security level is set to Medium.
<P>
Restricted Sites Zone:
<P>
This zone contains Web sites you do not trust. When you add a Web site 
to the Restricted Sites zone, you believe that files you download or run 
from the Web site may damage your computer or data. By default, there 
are no Web sites assigned to the Restricted Sites zone, and the security 
level is set to High.
<P>
Internet Zone:
<P>
This zone contains Web sites that are not on your computer or local 
intranet, or that are not already assigned to another zone. The default 
security level is Medium.
<P>
NOTE: Security settings are applied only to files on your computer that 
are in the Temporary Internet Files folder (using the security level of 
the Web site from which the files came). All other files are assumed to 
be completely safe.
<P>
<P><h3>How to Configure Security Zones</h3>
 
<P>
To change the default security level for a zone, customize security 
options within a zone, or assign a Web site to a specific zone, follow 
the steps in the appropriate section below:
<P>
Changing the Default Security Level for a Zone:
<P>
For each security zone, you can choose the High, Medium, Low, or Custom 
security level setting. Although Microsoft recommends the High security 
setting for Web sites that are not in the Trusted Sites zone, you can 
safely use the Medium security setting in the Trusted Sites zone.
<P>
To change the default security level for a zone, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Internet Explorer, click Internet Options on the View menu.

<P><LI>On the Security tab, click the zone for which you want to change
   security levels in the Zone box.

<P><LI>Click the security level you want to use for the zone, and then click
   OK.
<P>
</OL>Customizing Security Settings Within a Zone:
<P>
The Custom option gives advanced users and administrators more control 
over all security options. For example, the Download Unsigned ActiveX 
Controls option is disabled by default in the Local Intranet zone 
(Medium security is the default setting for the Local Intranet zone). In 
this case, Internet Explorer may not run any ActiveX controls in your 
company's intranet because most companies do not sign ActiveX controls 
that are used internally only. In order for Internet Explorer to run 
ActiveX controls in your company's intranet, you would want to change 
the security level for the Download Unsigned ActiveX Controls option to 
Prompt or Enable. You can set the following security options using the 
Custom setting:

<UL><LI>Access to files, ActiveX controls, and scripts.

<LI>The level of capabilities given to Java programs.

<LI>Whether sites must be identified with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
   authentication.

<LI>Password protection using Windows NT Challenge/Response (NTLM). 
   Depending on which zone a server is in, Internet Explorer can send 
   your password automatically, prompt you for your user name and 
   password, or simply deny any login requests.
<P>
</UL>To customize security options within a zone, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Internet Explorer, click Internet Options on the View menu.

<P><LI>On the Security tab, click the zone you want to customize in the Zone
   box.

<P><LI>Click Custom (For Expert Users), and then click Settings.

<P><LI>Under Reset Custom Settings, click the security level for the entire
   zone in the Reset To box, and then click Reset.

<P><LI>Under the section for which you want to customize security settings,
   click the option you want, click OK, and then click OK again.
<P>
</OL>Assigning a Web Site to a Specific Security Zone:
<P>
To assign a Web site to a specific security zone, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>In Internet Explorer, click Internet Options on the View menu.

<P><LI>On the Security tab, click the zone you want to assign a Web site to 
   in the Zone box, and then click Add Sites.
<P>
   If you add a Web site to the Local Intranet zone, click to select
   the check boxes of the types of Web sites you want to include in the
   zone, and then click Advanced.

<P><LI>Type a Web address in the "Add this Web site to the zone" box, and 
   then click Add.

<P><LI>Click OK, and then click OK again.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: You cannot assign a Web site to the Internet zone. The Internet 
zone contains all Web sites that are not on your computer or local 
intranet, or that are not already assigned to another zone.
