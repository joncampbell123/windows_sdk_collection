The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 2.0, 3.0, 3.01, 3.02
<LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 3.0, 3.01, 3.02a for Windows 
   3.1

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you use Internet Explorer to save an image as your desktop wallpaper,
the image may not look the same on your desktop as it does in Internet 
Explorer. This behavior may occur for one or both of the following 
reasons:

<UL><LI>The image must be converted from its existing file format to bitmap
   (.bmp) format.

<LI>Windows does not use dithering when it displays the desktop
   wallpaper.
<P>
</UL>MORE INFORMATION

<P>
 
<P>
When you save a graphics file other than a bitmap file as your desktop 
wallpaper, the image must be converted from its existing file format to 
bitmap format before it can be displayed on your desktop. When the file is
converted from one graphics file format to another, the appearance of the 
image may be altered.
<P>
In addition, Internet Explorer uses a technique called "dithering" when it
displays images. Dithering enables Internet Explorer to display a larger 
number of colors than your display type normally allows. A dithered color 
is a combination of available colors that gives the appearance of a 
new color. Windows does not use dithering when it displays the desktop 
wallpaper. Therefore, when you save an image as your desktop wallpaper 
using Internet Explorer, it may not look the same as it does in Internet 
Explorer.
<P>
You can save an image as your desktop wallpaper by right-clicking the 
image in Internet Explorer, and then clicking Set As Wallpaper. 

<P>
When you save an image as your desktop wallpaper using Internet Explorer 
in Windows 95, it is saved as Windows\Internet Explorer Wallpaper.bmp.
<P>
When you save an image as your desktop wallpaper using Internet Explorer
in Windows 3.x, it is saved as Windows\Iewall.bmp.
