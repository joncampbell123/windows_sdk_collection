The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0 for Windows NT 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you copy a file using the Windows NT user interface, the file may
not acquire the permissions of the destination folder. Instead, the file's
permissions remain as they were in the original folder.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, obtain Internet Explorer 4.01. To do so, visit
the following Microsoft Web site:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/download/">http://www.microsoft.com/ie/download/</A></B>

</PRE>To work around this issue, copy the file from a command prompt. For
information about copying a file from a command prompt, follow these
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Command Prompt.

<P><LI>At the command prompt, type "copy /?" (without quotation marks), and
   then press ENTER.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This issue is fixed in Internet Explorer 4.01.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When copying a file, Windows NT treats the destination file as though it
were a new file. If the folder that receives the file is on an NTFS
volume and has default new-file permissions, the file's current
permissions are replaced with those defaults. The user who copies the file
becomes the owner of the new file. If a folder is copied to an NTFS
volume, it inherits the directory and default new-file permissions of its
new parent folder. The new files in turn inherit the new-file permissions
of their parent folder.
<P>
Normal behavior when moving a file or folder is that when a file or folder
is moved to another location on the same logical NTFS file system drive,
it retains its permissions and owners. If a file or folder is moved
between logical drives, the file or folder inherits the permissions of the
folder it is moved to. If a file or folder is moved or copied to a FAT
file system drive, all permisisons are lost because FAT file system drives
do not have the ability to set permissions.
