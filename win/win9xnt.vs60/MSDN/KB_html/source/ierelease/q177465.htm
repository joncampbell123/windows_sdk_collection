<P><h3>3. Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
 
<P>
Q. Will you be updating Microsoft Chat?
<P>
A. We will update our Web site frequently. To view the updates, click
<PRE>   the Help menu, click Microsoft On The Web, and then click Free Stuff.


</PRE>Q. How do I connect to other IRC chat rooms or channels?
<P>
A. If you want to connect to an IRC chat room or channel that you
<PRE>   already know about, carry out the following steps:

   1. If you are running with Internet Explorer 3.0, click the File
      menu, and then click New Window.

      Otherwise, you can just click New Connection.

   2. In the Connect dialog box, type the following information:

      - In the Server box, type the IRC server name.
        The default entry is ComicSrv1.Microsoft.com.

        Replace this with the IRC server you want to connect to.

      - In the Chat room box, type the chat room name, preceded by a
        number sign (#).
        The default channel name is #Comic_Chat.


</PRE>Q. How can I tell which version of Microsoft Chat I am running?
<P>
A. If you are running Microsoft Chat outside of Internet Explorer, click
<PRE>   the Help menu, and then click About Microsoft Chat. The version number
   is listed at the top of the box. From within Internet Explorer, you can
   click the Help menu, click Microsoft Chat Help, and then click About
   Microsoft Chat.


</PRE>Q. Why can't I get access to any Microsoft Chat or IRC chat rooms?
<P>
A. If you are accessing the Internet from your corporate network, you
<PRE>   will be able to download the Microsoft Chat program; however, most
   corporate proxy servers limit access to chat rooms. If you have any
   questions, please contact your system administrator or use a dial-up
   analog or ISDN line to access the Internet.


</PRE>Q. Can I create my own comic characters?
<P>
A. At this time you can use only the characters supplied with Microsoft
<PRE>   Chat. To open a Web page that contains additional characters you can
   download, click the Help menu, click Microsoft On The Web, and then
   click Free Stuff. We are working on a character-creation kit that will
   be available from the Free Stuff Web page in the second half of 1997.


</PRE>Q. Can I create my own backgrounds?
<P>
A. Microsoft Chat supplies a limited number of backgrounds, but more will
<PRE>   be added soon. Backgrounds are bitmap files, which you can create with
   any graphics package.


</PRE>Q. How does the emotion wheel (lower right corner) work?
<P>
A. The emotion wheel enables you to manually change your character's
<PRE>   emotions. The center of the emotion wheel is neutral emotion. Where
   there are multiple levels of emotion, the intensity of the emotion
   increases as the control moves away from the center.

   To see a tooltip describing each emotion, rest your mouse pointer over
   one of the eight faces around the perimeter of the emotion wheel. To
   change your character's emotions, drag the control (the dark dot in
   the center of the emotion wheel) from the center of the emotion wheel.


</PRE>Q. How can I tell characters apart when there are duplicate characters?
<P>
A. Move your mouse pointer over the character and then pause. A tooltip
<PRE>   appears that displays the user name and character.


</PRE>Q. How do I print?
<P>
A. On the File menu, click Print, click Properties, and then click
<PRE>   Graphics. Change the resolution to 150 or 300 bps. This will speed
   up printing and still provide high quality.


</PRE>Q. How big is Microsoft Chat to download?
<P>
A. The program with its existing artwork is currently 1 MB compressed.
<P>
<P>
Q. How much space does Microsoft Chat take up?
<P>
A. The Microsoft Chat program with its existing artwork is currently 4 MB.
<PRE>   Forthcoming artwork and character updates will increase this size.


</PRE>Q. Can I uninstall Microsoft Chat?
<P>
A. Yes. To uninstall Microsoft Chat, carry out the following steps:
<P>
<PRE>   1. In Control Panel, double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.
   2. Click Microsoft Chat, and then follow the instructions on your
      screen.


</PRE>Q. Why does it say my ID is in use when I go to another chat room?
<P>
A. Nicknames (IDs) must be unique. Your connection will be refused if:
<P>
<PRE>   - You are already connected to a chat room on the server.
   - You recently disconnected and the server has not refreshed.
   - Someone else is using your nickname.

   To connect, you can either choose a new nickname or make sure that
   all Microsoft Chat clients have been closed and then wait a minute
   and reopen Microsoft Chat.


</PRE>Q. How do I get more panels across the screen?
<P>
A. There are a few things you can try:
<P>
<PRE>   - Increase your screen resolution. To do this, in Control Panel,
     double-click the Display icon, and then click the Settings tab.
   - Maximize the window.
   - Move the vertical splitter to the right to make the member list
     thinner.

   Once you have done this, click the View menu, and then choose the
   largest number of panels you can. Depending on your screen resolution
   and monitor size, you can select from one to four frames.


</PRE>Q. What is the difference between Microsoft Chat and IRC chat?
<P>
A. Microsoft Chat is a graphical chat client that can be used like any
<PRE>   text chat client on the IRC channel. Not everyone inside the channel
   (chat room) needs to be using Microsoft Chat for this to work. Text
   chat users will automatically be assigned a character, so the entire
   chat is graphically represented to the Microsoft Chat client user.

   NOTE: When you use Microsoft Chat on an IRC channel where most of
         the other users are using IRC text clients, it is a good idea
         to begin by clicking the Options menu and then selecting the
         Don't Send Microsoft Chat Specific Information check box. This
         will prevent special comics messages from being sent to the other
         chat clients. After you log off Microsoft Chat, the client will
         reset. The next time you log on, the check box is not selected.


</PRE>Q. Why do I get an "HTTP 1.0 / 404 Object Not Found" error from the
<PRE>   chat room Web page?

</PRE>A. The names of the room files and the names of the channels on the server
<PRE>   were changed. Your browser or Internet service provider may be caching
   the Web pages, and you are seeing the old page which links to files that
   no longer exist. To work around this problem, try refreshing the Web
   page or clearing the local cache if your browser caches the file.


</PRE>Q. How do I connect to comicsrv1.microsoft.com if I am using AOL as my
<PRE>   Internet service provider?

</PRE>A. If you are using AOL to connect to the Internet, you will need to
<PRE>   specify port number 7000 for the following comicsrv servers:

   - comicsrv1.microsoft.com
   - comicsrv2.microsoft.com
   - comicsrv3.microsoft.com

   To do this, in the Connect dialog box enter the server name followed by
   the port number--for example, comicsrv1.microsoft.com:7000. If this does
   not work, check the Frequently Asked Questions Web page for the latest
   information about this issue. You can view this Web page by clicking the
   Help menu, clicking Microsoft On The Web, and then clicking Frequently
   Asked Questions.


</PRE>Q. I click the hot links--such as http:, mailto:--in text mode, but nothing
<PRE>   happens. Why does this work in comics mode but not in text mode?

</PRE>A. The hot links in text mode are dependent on the rich edit functions in
<PRE>   Windows. Initially, the rich edit functions did not support the hot-link
   capability, but Windows NT and later versions of Windows 95 added this
   capability to rich edit. If you cannot use the hot links in text mode,
   you can always change to comics mode and use the hot links from there.


</PRE>Q. I have Comic Chat 1.0 on my computer, and after installing Microsoft
<PRE>   Chat 2.0, I see a shortcut to Comic Chat 1.0. Is it safe to delete the
   shortcut to Comic Chat 1.0?

</PRE>A. If you installed Microsoft Chat 2.0 over Comic Chat 1.0, you might see
<PRE>   Comic Chat 1.0 icons (as well as Microsoft Chat 2.0 icons) on the Start
   menu. You can safely delete the Comic Chat 1.0 icons; this will not
   affect the usability of Microsoft Chat 2.0. For more information, see
   the Microsoft Knowledge Base.


</PRE>Q. I have a previous version of Comic Chat on my computer. Should I
<PRE>   uninstall Comic Chat before installing Microsoft Chat?

</PRE>A. We recommend that you uninstall any previous version of Comic Chat
<PRE>   before installing Microsoft Chat 2.0. However if you did not uninstall
   Comic Chat before installing Microsoft Chat, you should not experience
   any problems with Microsoft Chat.
