The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0 for Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0 for Windows NT 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you view the Internet Explorer 4.0 Components Download page,
additional components that are installed on your computer may be
displayed as not installed.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur when the program that installed the component is
not an Internet Explorer 4.0 Active Setup-aware program.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, reinstall the component from the Internet Explorer
4.0 Components Download page. After you reinstall the component from the
Internet Explorer 4.0 Components Download page, you are notified of future
updates to the component.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The additional components available on the Internet Explorer 4.0
Components Download page are installed by default into folders in the
Program Files folder on the drive on which Windows is installed, except
for the Microsoft Interactive Music Control with Microsoft Synthesizer,
which is installed in the root folder on the drive on which Windows is
installed.
<P>
An Internet Explorer 4.0 Active Setup-aware program writes information to
the following registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\software\microsoft\active setup\installed components

</PRE>When you connect to the Internet Explorer 4.0 Components Download page,
this registry key is read to determine which components are installed on
your computer. If a component that is installed on your computer is
displayed on the Internet Explorer 4.0 Components Download page as not
installed, the program that installed the component did not write to this
registry key or the registry key has been removed.
<P>
