The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 3.0, 3.01, 3.02, 4.0 for
   Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 3.0, 3.01, 3.02, 4.0 for
   Windows NT 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to install an earlier version of Internet Explorer on a
computer on which Internet Explorer 4.0 (Version 4.71.1712.6) is running
in Browser only mode (the Windows Desktop Update is not installed),
several version conflict messages are displayed, but no other error
messages are displayed and the installation process proceeds normally.
<P>
After the earlier version of Internet Explorer is installed, you may be
unable to start Internet Explorer or Internet Explorer may not function
properly. The behavior that occurs after the earlier version of
Internet Explorer is installed depends on whether you choose to keep the
existing files or replace them when the version conflict messages are
displayed.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you install Internet Explorer 4.0 and then decide that you want to
return to an earlier version of Internet Explorer, you should uninstall
Internet Explorer 4.0 before you install the earlier version. For
information about uninstalling Internet Explorer 4.0, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../ierelease/q174265.htm">Q174265</A></B>
   TITLE     : How to Uninstall Internet Explorer 4.0

</PRE>For information about obtaining an earlier version of Internet Explorer,
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../zmiscellaneous/q164475.htm">Q164475</A></B>
   TITLE     : Availability of Internet Explorer 3.02 for Windows 95
               and Windows NT 4.0

</PRE>To work around this issue if you have already installed an earlier
version of Internet Explorer on a computer on which Internet Explorer 4.0
was running, install Internet Explorer 4.0 again, and then uninstall it.
After you uninstall Internet Explorer 4.0, install the earlier version of
Internet Explorer. For information on how to install Internet Explorer
4.0 again, see the following Web page:
<P>
<PRE>   <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie">http://www.microsoft.com/ie</A></B>

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet
Explorer version 4.0. This problem has been addressed in Internet
Explorer 4.01 (Version 4.72.2106.8). When attempting to install a
previous version of Internet Explorer over Internet Explorer 4.01
in Browser only mode, the following message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Newer version of Internet Explorer detected
   The installation of Internet Explorer &lt;version&gt; cannot proceed
   because you already have a newer version of Internet Explorer
   installed. Internet Explorer &lt;version&gt; setup will now quit.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If you attempt to install an earlier version of Internet Explorer on a
computer on which Internet Explorer 4.0 (Version 1712.6) is running with
the Windows Desktop Update, the following error message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Internet Explorer 3.0 cannot be installed on a system that has
   Internet Explorer 4.0 installed.

</PRE>If you click OK, the following message is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   There was an error during the Setup process. Either the user pressed
   Cancel or there was not enough disk space. Installation failed.

</PRE>NOTE: For Internet Explorer 4.01, the following warning precedes
the above messages:
<P>
<PRE>   This program may not run correctly because of the new features
   in Internet Explorer 4.0. You may need to obtain an updated
   version of this program. For information about obtaining an
   updated version, click Details. Or, if you want to try running
   this program, click Details to determine whether it will cause
   other problems. Then, if running this program will not cause
   other problems, click Run Program.

</PRE>When you click Details on the Apps.hlp warning message, the following
information is displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Do not install previous versions of Internet Explorer over
   Internet Explorer 4.0. Older versions of Internet Explorer
   will not permit Internet Explorer 4.0 to function properly.
   If you accidentally install an older version of Internet
   Explorer over Internet Explorer 4.0, uninstall Internet
   Explorer and then reinstall Internet Explorer 4.0.

</PRE>For additional information, see the "Setup" topic in the Ie4.txt file
included with Internet Explorer 4.0.
