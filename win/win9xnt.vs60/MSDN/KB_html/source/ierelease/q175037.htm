IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to change the default storage location of
Outlook Express mail and news folders.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By default, the Outlook Express mail and news folders are located in the
&lt;Windows&gt;\Application Data\Microsoft\Outlook Express folder, where
&lt;Windows&gt; is the folder in which Windows 95 is installed. In Windows NT
and in Windows 95 with user profiles enabled, the Outlook Express mail and
news folders are located in the &lt;Windows&gt;\Profiles\&lt;Username&gt;\Application
Data\Microsoft\Outlook Express folder, where &lt;Windows&gt; is the folder in
which Windows is installed, and &lt;Username&gt; is the name you use to log on
to Windows. To change the default storage location of these folders,
follow the steps in the appropriate section below:
<P>
NOTE: If Microsoft Internet Mail and News was present on your computer
when you upgraded to Outlook Express, the default storage location of
Outlook Express mail and news folders is Program Files\Internet
Explorer\Internet Mail and News.
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry
Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys
And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit
it.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows 95</h3>
 
<P>
To change the storage location of Outlook Express mail or news, change the
"Store Root" value to the full path for the folder you want to use as the
new storage location. This value is located in the following registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Outlook Express

</PRE>NOTE: The Store Root folder contains a Mail folder and a News folder in
which the data files for mail and news are located. If you install Outlook
Express without upgrading Internet Mail and News, the Store Root is the
Outlook Express folder. If you include the Mail folder in the Store Root
path, a new Mail and News folder is created in the existing Mail folder.
As a result, you cannot see the messages in the Outlook Express\Mail
folder until you remove Mail from the Store Root path. When you use user
profiles, the "Store Root" value is located in the following registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_USERS\&lt;username&gt;\Software\Microsoft\Outlook Express

</PRE>where &lt;username&gt; is the name you use to log on to Windows 95.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows NT</h3>
 
<P>
To change the storage location of Outlook Express mail or news, change the
"Store Root" value to the full path to the folder you want to use as the
new storage location. This value is located in the following registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Outlook Express
