Cookies are bits of information written to your computer about you and
your visits to Web pages. They can include such information as:
<P>
<P><h3>Custom Pages</h3>
 
<P>
The MSN, The Microsoft Network, custom page is an example of a large
cookie. After you select the options you want for your page, the server
writes that information to your cookie to retrieve when you visit the
page later.
<P>
<P><h3>Shopping</h3>
 
<P>
If you visit a site that features a  "shopping cart" of items you wish to
purchase, a cookie can keep track of what you put in the cart. If you
need to leave and come back later, your shopping cart should be as you
left it. This keeps you from having to start over on the page.
<P>
<P><h3>Tracking</h3>
 
<P>
A webmaster can give you a cookie to track repeat visits to a page.
<P>
Cookies are written to the Windows\Cookies folder in a file named
&lt;Username&gt;.txt. The name of the file can vary with the name of the
current user, who the cookie was written for, and the different pages
offering cookies to your computer.
