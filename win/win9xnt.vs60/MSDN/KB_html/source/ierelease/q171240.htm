<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to configure Outlook Express to work offline.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To configure Outlook Express to work offline, Dial-Up Networking must be
installed and you must have Outlook Express configured for a mail or news
account that uses a Dial-Up Networking connection to connect to your
Internet service provider (ISP).
<P>
To configure Outlook Express to work offline, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>On the Tools menu, click Options.

<P><LI>Click the Dial-Up tab.

<P><LI>Under When Outlook Express Starts, click Do Not Dial A Connection.

<P><LI>Click the "Hang up when finished sending, receiving, or downloading"
   check box to select it.

<P><LI>Click OK.
<P>
</OL>After you configure Outlook Express to work offline, you can compose mail
or news messages, but they are not sent until you click Send And Receive
on the Tools menu, or you click Update in the main Outlook Express screen.
<P>
<P><h3>Additional Information</h3>
 
<P>
The Dial-Up tab contains the following options:
<P>
Do Not Dial a Connection:
<P>
This prevents Outlook Express from trying to connect when it is started.
This option is best for working offline with mail and news connections
configured to connect with a specific Dial-Up Networking connection.
<P>
Dial This Connection:
<P>
You can select the default connection Outlook Express dials when it is
started. You are not prompted for a connection to use. You receive a
password prompt if you have not enabled the Save Password option in the
Dial-Up Networking connection.
<P>
Ask Me If I Would Like to Dial a Connection:
<P>
Outlook Express prompts you to connect each time it is started. You can
select which Dial-Up Networking connection to use, or choose not to have
Outlook Express try to connect.
<P>
Warn Me Before Switching Dial Up Connections:
<P>
This causes Outlook Express to prompt you when it changes from one Dial-Up
Networking connection to another when you check mail or news for multiple
accounts configured to connect with different Dial-Up Networking
connections.
<P>
Hang Up When Finished Sending, Receiving, or Downloading:
<P>
This option causes Outlook Express to hang up the Dial-Up Networking
connection when Outlook Express has finished downloading or uploading mail
and newsgroup postings. This option is best when you use multiple mail and
news accounts, or when you need to keep phone usage to a minimum.
