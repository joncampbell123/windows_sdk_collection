<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
"Forms submit" is a method that is used to submit information to a Web
site.
<P>
When the "Warn if forms submit is being redirected" check box is selected,
an Internet Redirection dialog box appears when you are about to be
redirected to a new Web site. You can choose to continue to the new Web
site, or you can choose not to continue. If you choose to continue, any
information you exchanged with the current Web site (such as your e-mail
address) may be accessed by the new Web site.
<P>
This article describes how to cause Internet Explorer to notify you when a
forms submit is about to be redirected to a new Web site.
<P>
