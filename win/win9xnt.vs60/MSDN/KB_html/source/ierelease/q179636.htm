The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 4.0, 4.01 for Windows NT 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to install Internet Explorer, you may receive the following
error message at the end of Active Setup:
<P>
<PRE>   Installation is incomplete

   The following Internet Explorer 4.0 components were not installed.

   Internet Explorer 4.0 Web Browser
   Windows Desktop Update
   Microsoft Outlook Express

   For more information, click Help. Setup will now finish the
   installation for components that were installed successfully.

</PRE>When you click OK to continue, and then click OK to restart your computer,
you may receive several of the following error messages when you log in to
Microsoft Windows NT:

<UL><LI>An error occurred loading "C:\WINNT\System32\mlang.dll". The file may
   not have been installed or it has been corrupted.

<LI>Unable to call the function "DllInstall" in the file
   "C:\WINNT\System32\comctl32.dll" because that function does not exist
   or is not exported.

<LI>CAPI: The install program could not open signature file

<LI>Unable to find the function "DllRegisterServer" in the file

   to make it your default browser?
<P>
</UL>After you receive the error messages, the previously installed version of
Internet Explorer may start automatically.
<P>
When you try to remove Internet Explorer using the Add/Remove Programs
tool in Control Panel, you may receive the following error messages:

<UL><LI>Setup Error 544
   Setup is unable to open the data file 'C:\Program Files\Plus!\Microsoft
   Internet\Setup\SETUP.stf'; run Setup again from where you originally
   ran it.

<LI>Setup Error 723
   Setup was unable to read configuration information from the first
   section of the setup file: C:\Program Files\Plus!\Microsoft
   Internet\Setup\SETUP.stf.

<LI>Setup was not completed successfully.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if the Winhlp32.exe file is not present in the
%SystemRoot%\System32 folder.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Copy the Winhlp32.exe file from the %SystemRoot% folder to the
   %SystemRoot%\System32 folder, or expand the Winhlp32.exe file from the
   Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM to the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder.

<P><LI>Install Internet Explorer again.
