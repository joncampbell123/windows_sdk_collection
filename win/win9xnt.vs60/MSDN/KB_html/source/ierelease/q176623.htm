<P><h2>MICROSOFT OUTLOOK EXPRESS</h2>
 
<P>
Outlook Express Mail is an Internet standards based e-mail and news
reader.
<P>
To read e-mail with Outlook Express, you must be using a mail system
that uses SMTP and POP3 or IMAP protocols. At this time, you cannot
use Microsoft Outlook Express to access your e-mail account with any
of the following services: MS Mail, cc:Mail, The Microsoft Network
(MSN), with the exception of the MSN "Metro" (MSN 2.5) beta release,
CompuServe, America Online (AOL), or Microsoft Exchange Server prior
to version 5. If you don't know whether your system uses these services,
contact your administrator or your Internet service provider and ask if
they support SMTP/POP3 or IMAP mail clients.
<P>
You can also use Microsoft Outlook Express News to read bulletin-board
discussion groups, such as the Usenet, using NNTP-based news servers.
Contact your Internet service provider or network administrator for
the name of the news server that you should use. Outlook Express News
can also be used to receive support for a variety of Microsoft
products on the news server msnews.microsoft.com.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>KNOWN ISSUES IN THIS RELEASE</h2>
 
<P>
- When receiving a message using a GeoCities mail account, you might
<PRE>  be unable to view any of the original message, or you may see only
  the following information:  Postage Paid by... [graphic].

</PRE>- You will not be able to see embedded objects or images sent from
<PRE>  people using Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Exchange, or Windows
  Messaging. File attachments work fine, however.

</PRE>- If you use HTML in your signature, and you send the message before
<PRE>  any included images have finished drawing, the text you add to the
  message may be lost.

</PRE>- Some mail clients send Cyrillic messages with tags indicating that
<PRE>  they are in a western European character set. As a result, Outlook
  Express uses a western-European font to display the message, which
  then appears garbled. To work around this problem, click the View
  menu, click Language, and then choose a Russian character set, such
  as K0I8. The message should display properly using the Russian font.

</PRE>- Inbox rules are not available for IMAP accounts.
<P>
- If you are using Outlook Express with a SUN Solstice, Netscape, or
<PRE>  Innosoft IMAP server, it may cause your server to stop responding.
  Please contact the 3rd party provider for an update to the IMAP
  server software to correct this problem.

</PRE>- Outlook Express S/MIME does not verify the status of digital IDs
<PRE>  before sending encrypted or signed messages. This means that a
  digital ID that is revoked, expired, not trusted or that has an
  incorrect e-mail address will be used without providing any warning.

</PRE>- To send signed messages and receive encrypted messages,  you must
<PRE>  have a digital ID. Currently, the only way to get a digital ID
  for use with Outlook Express is to use Internet Explorer 4.0 and
  go to the Verisign Web site, <B>http://digitalid.verisign.com.</B>

</PRE>- While sending and retrieving messages, closing Outlook Express and
<PRE>  restarting it will cause Outlook Express to crash.

</PRE>- In Outlook Express News, if the option "Get 300 headers at a time" is
<PRE>  turned on, the following commands: Get New Headers, Get New Messages,
  Get All Messages, and Get Marked Messages will retrieve only 300 (or
  the number that you specify) headers at a time. To prevent this, you
  should turn off this option.

</PRE>- To cancel a news message, you must be using the same message encoding
<PRE>  options as was used for the original message.

</PRE>- If no folders are displayed for your IMAP server or if you want
<PRE>  to refresh the list of IMAP folders you need to download the folder
  list from the server. To do this, select the IMAP server. If you
  connect to the server by using a modem, click the Tools menu, and
  then select Offline &gt; Dial. If you connect to the IMAP server by
  using a LAN, you can skip this step. After you have connected to
  the server, click the File menu, click Folders, and then click
  Refresh Folder List.

</PRE>- If you need to change any of the following settings for your IMAP
<PRE>  account:

  . IMAP server name or port number
  . Account type (POP3 or IMAP)
  . Any logon information

  it is recommended that you delete the IMAP account and create a new
  account with the updated settings.

</PRE>- Outlook Express is designed to work only with IMAP4 compliant
<PRE>  servers.  IMAP2bis servers are not supported in this release.

</PRE>- If you rename a news server account name and then attempt to
<PRE>  perform some action on it, for example copying messages from the
  server, you may receive an error message. To work around this
  problem, close OE and restart after the renaming of a server.

</PRE>- If encrypting a message when there is not a certificate for one of
<PRE>  the recipients, an error will display stating that there is not
  a certificate for that recipient as well as the sender.

</PRE>- Certificates are now handled on a per account basis. You must
<PRE>  reselect which certificate to use for each account from the
  Accounts menu. Select the account you want to configure for
  security features and check the box to use a certificate when
  sending secure messages. You must also click the Certificate button
  to select which to use.

</PRE>- If you used Internet News for reading newsgroups, any messages
<PRE>  in your "Posted Items" folder will be moved into the "Sent Items
  folder when you upgrade to Outlook Express.

</PRE>- Outlook Express only shows subscribed IMAP folders in the
<PRE>  folder list. It no longer shows all your folders (subscribed and
  unsubscribed). If you want to see all your folders in the folder
  list, you should subscribe to all your folders. Click on the "File"
  menu, then click "Folder &gt;" and select "Subscribe All Folders" menu.
  If there are folders that you don't want to displayed in the folder
  list, you can unsubscribe the folder.  Click on the File menu, click
  on Folder &gt;, and select "Unsubscribe Folder".

</PRE>- If you send a Rich Text (HTML) message which contains embedded
<PRE>  pictures and the option to "Send pictures with message" is turned
  off, any pictures from a local computer or LAN will not be viewed
  when receiving and reading the message using Netscape's Messenger.

</PRE><h3>Note to French users</h3>
 
In order to comply with the French laws on the use of encryption
material, S/MIME support in Outlook Express has been disabled when
used in France. However, SSL 2.0 and SSL 3.0 support is authorized,
and hence left enabled.

<P><h2>TROUBLESHOOTING</h2>
 
<P>
- If you run into a problem, try the troubleshooter in online Help
<PRE>  or on the Microsoft Web site at
  <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/support/tshooters.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/support/tshooters.htm.</A></B> To start the online

     Topics.

    provider.
  - Your Internet service provider or LAN server supports POP3 or
    IMAP and SMTP.

    protocol) are set correctly.

</PRE>- Make sure that you use an account name and password for a news

     can type 131.107.3.27 instead.

  You do not need to log on to this news server.

  Book by right-clicking the name, and then clicking Add To Address
  Book.

</PRE>- To view responses to a particular message in a newsgroup, click the
<PRE>  plus sign (+) next to the message. The responses appear indented
  below it.

</PRE>- In mail, you can leave a copy of your messages on the server. To set
<PRE>  this option, click the Tools menu, and then click Accounts. Select
  the mail account you want to modify, and then click Properties. Click
  the Advanced tab, and then select the Leave A Copy Of Messages On
  Server check box.

</PRE>- It is possible to use HTML files as signatures as well as plain
<PRE>  text files.

</PRE>- To reorder columns, you can drag and drop column headings. Columns
<PRE>  can be resized by dragging the right edge of the column header.

<PRE>  double-click the message to open it in a separate window, click the
  View menu, and then click Full Headers.

</PRE>- If you are running Outlook Express on Windows NT and you need to add
<PRE>  support for a different language, double-click the Keyboard icon in
  Control Panel, and then click Add. Follow the instructions on your
  screen. This installs the appropriate NLS (National Language
  Support) files. You do not have to use the associated keyboard
  layout.
