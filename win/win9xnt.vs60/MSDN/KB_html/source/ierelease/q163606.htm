The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 2.0, 3.0, 3.01, 3.02, 4.0 for

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to configure Internet Explorer to display an
Edit button on the toolbar. This allows you to view Hypertext Markup
Language (HTML) source code with the editor of your choice.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By default, you can use the Source command on the View menu in Internet
Explorer to view HTML source code in Notepad. To add an Edit button to the
toolbar so that you can view HTML code in the editor you want, follow
these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Quit Internet Explorer (if it is running).

<P><LI>Double-click My Computer.

<P><LI>On the View menu, click Options (or Folder Options).

<P><LI>Click the File Types tab. In the Registered File Types box, click
   Internet Document (HTML), and then click Edit.

<P><LI>If Edit is not listed in the Actions box, there is not an Edit button on
   the Internet Explorer toolbar. To add an Edit button to the toolbar,
   click New, type "Edit" (without quotation marks) in the Action box, and
   then type the full path to the name of the editor that you want to use
   in the Application Used To Perform Action box. If you are using Internet
   Explorer 2.0 or 3.x as your browser, you may need to type a space and
   "%1" (including the quotation marks) at the end of the command. For
   example, if you want to use Notepad to be your default HTML editor,
   type the following command:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:\windows\notepad.exe "%1"
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: If you do not know the path or file name for the editor you want
   to use, you can click Browse to locate the editor instead of manually
   typing it in the Application Used To Perform Action box.
<P>
   If Edit is listed in the Actions box, there is already an Edit button on
   The Internet Explorer toolbar. To select a default HTML editor, click
   Edit under Actions, click the Edit button, and then type the full path
   to the program you want to use as your default HTML editor.

<P><LI>Click OK, click Close, and then click Close again.
<P>
</OL>Once you have completed these steps, Internet Explorer displays an Edit
button on the toolbar and a Current Page command on the Edit menu. Use
either of these to view the source code for the current document. Also,
after you have completed these steps, the Edit command is added to the
context menu that appears when you right-click an HTML file.
<P>
<P><h3>Notes</h3>
 

<UL><LI>If you are using Internet Explorer 2.0 or 3.x and do not type the "%1"
   at the end of the command, you may receive the following error message
   when you attempt to view source code:
<P>
<P><PRE>      &lt;DRIVE&gt;:\Temporary
      Cannot find this file.
      Please verify that the correct path and file name are given.
</PRE><P>
   This error occurs when the file is contained in a folder with spaces in
   its long file name. Examples include the "Temporary Internet Files"
   folder and the "My Documents" folder.

<LI>The editor you choose must be able to understand long file names, or
   you may receive an error message similar to the following when you try
   to view the source code:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Cannot find the "C:\Windows\tempor~1\Cache\&lt;filename.htm&gt;
</PRE>
<LI>Although the Edit button and Current Page command both open the HTML
   source in the editor you specified, using the Source command on the
   View menu still opens the HTML source code in Notepad.
