<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you reply to or forward a message that was composed using "Plain
Text, Quoted Printable" format in Outlook Express, there is not a quote
character at the beginning of each line of text that is included from
the message you received.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is a side effect of the "Plain Text, Quoted Printable" format in
the message you received.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Generally, you see a quote character (such as "&gt;") on each line of the
message you are quoting. For this to work, there must be a &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; pair
(\r\n) at the end of each line.
<P>
When a message is sent using "Plain Text, Quoted Printable" format, an
equal sign is added to the end of the line to let the browser know that
the line continues. Therefore, there is only one quote character at the
beginning of each paragraph quoted.
<P>
The main purpose of "Plain Text, Quoted Printable" format is to allow
for line wrapping. When you send mail on the Internet, you can send only
80 characters on a line of text. To provide word-wrap capability, the
lines are packaged in "Plain Text, Quoted Printable" format. This ends
each line with an equal sign to indicate that it continues to the next
line.
