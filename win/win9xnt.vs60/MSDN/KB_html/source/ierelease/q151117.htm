<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article briefly describes the most common types of Internet error
messages.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The five most common categories of Internet errors are:

<UL><LI>Web browser errors
<LI>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) errors
<LI>Usenet errors
<LI>Gopher/Veronica errors
<LI>E-mail errors
<P>
</UL><h3>Web Browser Errors</h3>
 

<UL><LI>404 Not Found
<P>
   The browser could not find the specific document that you requested on
   the host computer. To resolve this error, check the Uniform Resource
   Locator (URL) syntax (some URLs are case sensitive). In addition, the
   page may have been removed, had its name changed, or have been moved to
   a new location.

<LI>403 Forbidden/Access Denied
<P>
   The Web site you requested requires special access permission (for
   example a password).

<LI>503 Service Unavailable
<P>
   The host computer is too busy. Try viewing the page again after about
   30 seconds.

<LI>Bad File Request
<P>
   The form or the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) code for an online
   form has an error.

<LI>Cannot Add Form Submission Result to Bookmark List
<P>
   The results of a form (such as a WebCrawler search) cannot be saved as
   a bookmark. A bookmark can only be a document or an address.

<LI>Connection Refused by Host
<P>
   This is a version of the 403 error. The Web site you requested requires
   special access permission.

<LI>Failed DNS Lookup
<P>
   The Web site's URL could not be translated into a valid Internet
   protocol (IP) address. This error is common on commercial sites because
   the computers responsible for translating the IP addresses are
   overloaded. Try again later when there may be less Internet traffic.
   This can also be caused by a URL syntax error (the URL has incorrect
   format).

<LI>HTTP Server at Compressed &lt;xxx&gt;.com:8080 Replies:HTTP/1.0 500 Error
   from Proxy:
<P>
   This error is common with proxy servers (a server on a local area
   network that lets you connect to the Internet without using a modem).
   The proxy is either down, busy, or cannot interpret the command that
   was sent to it. You may want to wait for 30 seconds or more then try
   viewing the page again. If the problem persists, contact the network
   administrator of that proxy. Whatever is shown instead of &lt;xxx&gt;.com is
   usually your Internet service provider.

<LI>File Contains no Data
<P>
   The browser found the site, but nothing in the specific file. Try
   adding ":80" (without the quotation marks) to the URL just before
   the first slash, for example: <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com:80/">http://www.microsoft.com:80/</A></B>

<LI>Helper Application not Found
<P>
   You have attempted to download a file that needs a helper program, and
   your browser cannot find the program. On the browser's preferences or
   options menu, make sure the correct directory and file name are entered
   for the helper program. If you do not have a helper program, save the
   file to disk and obtain the helper program.

<LI>NTTP Server Error
<P>
   The browser could not find the Usenet newsgroup that you tried to
   access. Make sure the news server address is correctly listed in your
   browser's preferences or options menu and try again.

<LI>Not Found
<P>
   The link no longer exists.

<LI>Site Unavailable
<P>
   Too many users are trying to access the site, the site is down for
   maintenance, there is noise on the line, or the site no longer exists.
   This can also be caused by a user URL syntax error.

<LI>TCP Error Encountered While Sending Request to Server
<P>
   This error is caused by erroneous data on the line between you and the
   requested site. This may be hardware related. Report the error to your
   network administrator and try again later.

<LI>Too Many Users
<P>
   The site is busy. You may want to try again after about 30 seconds.

<LI>Unable to Locate Host
<P>
   The URL did not return anything, the site is unavailable, or the
   Internet connection was dropped. Check the hardware connections and
   URL syntax.

<LI>Cannot Connect to Server
<P>
   This error can occur if you are using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
   security ("https" at the beginning of the URL) when you are connecting
   to certain Web servers. This behavior has been seen on C2's StrongArm
   servers with Internet Explorer 3.x and 4.0 in Windows 95 and Windows
</UL>NT.
<P>
<P><h3>FTP Errors</h3>
 
<P>
Because there are many FTP programs available, error messages may vary.

<UL><LI>Invalid Host or Unable to Resolve
<P>
   This is the FTP equivalent of the Web browser's 404 error. The FTP
   program cannot find the site requested. This can also be caused by a
   URL syntax error.

<LI>Your FTP program connects then suddenly stops responding.
<P>
   NOTE: this is not an error message.
   If this occurs shortly after you log on, try using a dash (-) as the
   first character of your password. This turns off the site's
   informational messages, which may be causing a conflict with the FTP
   program.

<LI>Too many consecutive transmit errors
<P>
   NOTE: this is not an error message.
   This indicates that line noise has prevented the FTP program from
   continuing. This could be a hardware problem, the command string sent
   to your modem may be incorrect, or the modem may not be properly
   configured.
<P>
</UL><h3>Usenet Errors</h3>
 
<P>
Usenet is the collection of computers and networks that share news
articles. It overlaps with the Internet, but not identical to it
<P>
These type of errors are usually specific to your news reader.

<UL><LI>Invalid Newsgroup
<P>
   This is caused by a URL syntax error, or the news server may not carry
   the newsgroup you are trying to access. See your network administrator
   for assistance.

<LI>No Such Message
<P>
   This message indicates an outdated message. The message you
   requested is still in the index, but has been removed from the server.

<LI>Could Not Connect to Server
<P>
   The news server is busy or is down, or you do not have access to the
   news server. Another possibility is that your browser or news reader
   program has been set up incorrectly.

<LI>The Message Appears Unintelligible
<P>
   NOTE: this is not an error message.
   This is caused by a binary (non-text) file, such as a picture, movie,
   or program, that has been encoded into text characters. Most news
   readers include automatic decoding of binary files. To decode a file,
   use a decoding program or purchase a news reader that supports
   automatic decoding.
<P>
</UL><h3>Gopher/Veronica Errors</h3>
 
<P>
The Gopher protocol is a menu-based interface for opening resources on the
Internet. The menus have the same function as hyperlinks on the Web.
Gophers (and their search engine, Veronica) rarely return errors. The
most commonly returned messages are "Can't find site" or "Too busy."

<UL><LI>Xxxxx Does Not Exist
<P>
   This error occurs when a menu lists an item that longer exists. The
   item may have been moved or renamed. Gopher menus must be updated
   manually so they sometimes refer to outdated catalogs.

<LI>Your Search on Xxxyyyzzz Returned Nothing
<P>
   Your search term did not appear in the catalog or menu.

<LI>Sorry, But We Don't Allow Off-Site Access to this Server
<P>
   This error occurs when you have tried to access a network or site that
   has been set up strictly for local use. You cannot access the Gopher
   site unless you are considered part of that local network.
<P>
</UL><h3>E-Mail Errors</h3>
 
<P>
Most mail errors are URL syntax errors. Commas and spaces are not allowed
in e-mail addresses.

<UL><LI>Unknown User
<P>
   This may be caused by a URL syntax error. The name was typed
   incorrectly or the address was typed incorrectly.

<LI>Mail for a mail list stops appearing
<P>
   NOTE: this is not an error message.
   This may be caused be a temporary problem at the site or on the
   Internet. You may have been involuntarily "unsubscribed" by the mail
   list program at the site. Or, the list may have been discontinued.

<LI>Warning: Message Still Undelivered After Xx Hours
<P>
   This is a warning indicating that the mail message may be delayed. The
   mailer will continue to send, depending on the configuration of the
   mailer.
