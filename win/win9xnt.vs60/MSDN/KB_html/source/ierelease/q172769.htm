<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../ie_app/q168636.htm">Q168636</A></B>
   TITLE     : Microsoft Web Publishing Wizard Version 1.5 Available

</PRE>To post Web content to a Web server with WPW, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Click Start, point to Programs, point to Internet Explorer, and then
   click Web Publishing Wizard.
<P>
   NOTE: If you installed Web Publishing Wizard 1.5 on your computer
   before installing Internet Explorer 4.0, click Start, point to
   Programs, point to Microsoft Web Publishing, and then click Web
   Publishing Wizard.

<P><LI>Click Next.

<P><LI>In the File Or Folder Name box, type the path to the file or folder for
   the Web content you want to post, and then click Next.
<P>
   NOTE: To select only one file to post, click Browse Files, navigate to
   the folder that contains the file you want to post, click the file, and
   then click OK. To select all of the files and folders within a folder,
   click Browse Folders, navigate to the folder that contains the
   files you want to post, click the folder, click the Include Subfolders
   check box to select it, and then click OK.

<P><LI>In the Descriptive Name box, type a descriptive name for the Web site
   you are posting to, and then click Next.

<P><LI>In the Select Your Service Provider dialog box, click the service
   provider used by your ISP, and then click Next.
<P>
   Service Providers:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - FrontPage Extended Web
    - FTP
    - HTTP Post
    - Microsoft Content Replication System
    - Automatically Select Service Provider
</PRE><P>
   NOTE: When you choose Automatically Select Service Provider, if WPW
   cannot determine the service provider used by your ISP, you are
   returned to the Select Your Service Provider dialog box. If you do not
   know which service provider your ISP uses, contact your ISP.
<P>
   For intranet Web sites (usually internal corporate sites running on a
   local area network [LAN]) using Microsoft Internet Information Server
   (IIS) version 3.0 or later, you may be able to use one or more of the
   following methods to post your Web content:
<P>
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Content Replication System.
    - HTTP Post (RFC-1867 compliant).
    - FrontPage Extended Web.
</PRE><P>
   These methods may require the Web server's administrator to make
   configuration changes to the Web server. We recommend you contact the
   Web server's administrator to determine the preferred method.
<P>
   For Internet Web sites, the FTP protocol is the most common method of
   posting Web content to a Web server. There are versions of the
   FrontPage Extensions for Web servers using the UNIX operating system.
   To determine whether your ISP supports these extensions, contact your
   ISP.

<P><LI>Use the appropriate method for your service provider.
<P>
<P><PRE>    - FrontPage Extended Web
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      In the URL Or Internet Address box, type the URL or Internet address
      to access your personal Web pages. In the Local Directory box, type
      the path to the folder for the Web content you want to post, and
      then click Next.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      If you are prompted a second time for your personal Web page URL
      address, type the name of the URL in the URL Or Internet Address
      box, and then click Next.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      When you are prompted, click the appropriate connection type, and
      then click Next.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: If you click Dial-Up Networking in the "Choose a Dial-Up
      Networking connection to access a server on the Internet" dialog
      box, click the appropriate connection type and connection settings
      for how you want to connect to the Internet.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      WPW verifies that your ISP is using the FrontPage Extended Web
      service provider, and then displays the Publish Your Files dialog
      box. Continue to step 7.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>    - FTP
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      In the URL Or Internet Address box, type the URL or Internet address
      to access your personal Web pages. In the Local Directory box, type
      the path to the folder that corresponds to the URL you typed, and
      then click Next.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      In the FTP Server Name box, type the name of your FTP server. In
      the Subfolder Containing Your Web Pages box, type the path to the
      folder for the Web content you want to post, and then click Next.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      NOTE: Some providers do not keep user Web pages in the same folder
      as in the http address. To verify your Web page folder's location,
      contact your ISP.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Note that for security reasons, server administrators can create
      folders that are mapped to other parts of the server, or in some
      cases, a file system on a different computer. These types of folders
      are known as virtual folders. A common example is illustrated below:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         To access your Web content, you use the following URL address:

            <B><A href="http://www.my_isp.com/~myname">http://www.my_isp.com/~myname</A></B>

         On the Web server, these files are actually located in a folder
         called:

            /users/home/myname/html

      When the URL to your pages is requested from the Web server, the
      Web server knows that "~myname" means to look in the "html" folder
      in your home folder. So, if you reguest <B><A href="http://www.my_isp.com/">http://www.my_isp.com/</A></B>
      ~myname/default.htm, the Web server retrieves the file /users/home/
      myname/html/default.htm and sends it to your Web browser. In this
      case, the "~myname" folder is the virtual folder.

      When you post files using FTP, you need to know what actual folder
      the virtual folder maps to. Usually, this folder is found in your
      home folder. If you are uncertain, contact your ISP.

    - HTTP Post

      In the URL Or Internet Address box, type the URL or Internet address
      to access your personal Web pages. In the Local Directory box, type
      the path to the folder for the Web content you want to post, and
      then click Next.

      If you are prompted, type the server name, a posting command, an
      option for Secure Socket Layer (SSL), and an option for post-
      processing if required. Click Next.

     - Microsoft Content Replication System

      In the URL Or Internet Address box, type the URL or Internet address
      to access your personal Web pages. In the Local Directory box, type
      the path to the folder for the Web content you want to post, and
      then click Next.

      NOTE: If the Postinfo.html file cannot be located or read, or the
      project name cannot be determined, type the server name in the CRS
      Server Name box, type the project name in the CRS Project Name box,
      and then click Next.

      NOTE: Contact your ISP or the server administrator if you receive
      the following error message:

         Could not bind to the CRS server with the information you
         specified. Please re-enter the requested information.

      For automatic detection of the posting type to work properly, the
      ISP or server administrator must have created a Postinfo.html or
      Webpost.html file that contains all of the server-specific
      information. The Postinfo.htm file contains several definitions for
      the WebPost client, one of these definitions being the posting URL,
      which by default points to Posting Acceptor. The Postinfo.html file
      is used by the Web Publishing Wizard only. The WebPost application
      programming interface (API) on the client's computer determines
      where to post content using the information it receives from the
      Postinfo.html file. ISPs can get more information about creating a
      Postinfo.html file from the following Web site:

         <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/software/webpost/isp.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/software/webpost/isp.htm</A></B>

    - Automatically Select Service Provider

      In the Specify The URL And Directory dialog box, type the URL or
      Internet address in the URL Or Internet Address box to access your
      personal Web pages, and then click Next.

      NOTE: WPW attempts to verify the posting method the server uses. If
      WPW can determine the posting method, the Publish Your Files screen
      appears. If the screen appears, continue to step 7. If the screen
      does not appear, you are returned to the Select Service Provider
      dialog box.

</PRE><P><LI>In the Publishing Your Files screen, click Finish. If the posting
   method requires you to log on, you are prompted for your user name and
   password. Once you log on, WPW copies your files to the Web server.
   When this process is complete, the following message appears:
<P>
<P><PRE>      The Web Publishing Wizard has successfully published your file(s)
      to the Web server.
</PRE>
<P><LI>Click OK to close the Web Publishing Wizard.
