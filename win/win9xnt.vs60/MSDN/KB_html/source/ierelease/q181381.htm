The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook Express versions 4.0, 4.01 for Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you start Outlook Express, you may receive the following error
message:
<P>
<PRE>   A file needed to store your IMAP files locally could not be found. We
   may be out of Sync with the IMAP server.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if the registry key associated with your e-mail
account on the Internet Mail Access Protocol (IMAP) server is damaged.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry
Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys
And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit
it. If you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency
Repair Disk (ERD).
<P>
To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Use Registry Editor to locate the following registry key:
<P>
<P><PRE>    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Account Manager\Accounts
</PRE><P>
   The Accounts key contains several keys named 00000001 and so on. Check
   each of these keys to locate the key containing the information for the
   IMAP e-mail account. When you locate the correct key, delete it, and
   then quit Registry Editor.

<P><LI>In Outlook Express, click Accounts on the Tools menu.

<P><LI>Click the Mail tab, and then verify that the IMAP e-mail account does
   not appear.

<P><LI>Click Add, and then type the information for the IMAP e-mail account to
   re-create the account. For information about creating an e-mail account
   in Outlook Express, click Contents And Index on the Help menu in
   Outlook Express, click the Index tab, type "servers" (without quotation
   marks), and then double-click the "Adding" topic.
