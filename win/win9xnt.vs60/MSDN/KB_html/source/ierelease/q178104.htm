The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook Express versions 4.0, 4.01 for Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Outlook Express versions 4.0, 4.01 for Windows NT 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry  Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you first choose the folder to store your messages in after you
upgrade to Outlook Express, Outlook Express may stop responding (hang).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can occur if a program is running in the background when you
choose the message storage location.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry
Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys
And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit
it.
<P>
To resolve this issue, add a value named Store Root to the following
registry branch:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Outlook Express

</PRE>Set the value data for the Store Root value to the full path of the folder
you want to use as the message storage location.
<P>
NOTE: The Store Root folder contains a Mail folder and a News folder in
which the data files for mail and news are located. The Store Root folder
is not the folder containing the data files; it is the folder containing
the Mail and the News folders. If you include the Mail folder in the Store
Root path, a new Mail and News folder is created in the existing Mail
folder. As a result, you cannot see the messages in the Outlook
Express\Mail folder until you remove Mail from the Store Root path.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Outlook Express versions
4.0 and 4.01. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
