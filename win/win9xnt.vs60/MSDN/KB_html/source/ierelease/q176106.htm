The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 4.0, 4.01 for Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 4.0, 4.01 for Windows NT 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you click a link to a file, click Save This File To Disk, change the
name of the file or specify a download folder in the File Name box, and
then save it, the file that is saved may have no file extension.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem can occur if Internet Explorer 4.0 is installed and the "Hide
file extensions for known file types" (or "Hide MS-DOS file extensions for
file types that are registered") check box is selected.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, rename the file using its correct extension.
To do so, locate and right-click the file you downloaded, click Rename,
type the correct file extension, and then press ENTER.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Explorer 4.0 and
4.01. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To avoid this problem, specify the download folder in the Save in box
instead of the file name box, or use one of the following methods before
you download a file:
<P>
<P><h3>Disable the Hiding of File Extensions</h3>
 
<P>
To disable the hiding of file extensions, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Double-click My Computer, and then click Options (or Folder Options)
   on the View menu.

<P><LI>Click the View tab, and then click the "Hide file extensions for known
   file types" (or "Hide MS-DOS file extensions for file types that are
   registered") check box to clear it.

<P><LI>Click OK, and then close My Computer.
<P>
</OL><h3>Rename the File After Downloading</h3>
 
<P>
Do not rename the file before you begin downloading it. You can then
rename the file after the download is finished.
<P>
<P><h3>Retain the File Name Extension</h3>
 
<P>
If you want to rename the file before you begin downloading it, type
the correct file extension after the file name. For example, if you
are renaming a file named Test.exe, you could type "newname.exe"
(without quotation marks).
