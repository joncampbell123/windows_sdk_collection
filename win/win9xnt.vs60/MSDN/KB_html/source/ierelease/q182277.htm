The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook Express versions 4.0, 4.01 for Windows 95
</UL> 
<P>
IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you delete a mail or news account in Outlook Express, the account
may continue to appear.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can be caused by an incorrect or damaged entry in the
registry.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry
Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys
And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit
it.
<P>
To resolve this issue, delete the appropriate key in the registry. To do
so, first locate the following registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Account Manager\Accounts

</PRE>Mail accounts are labeled 00000001, 00000002, and so on. News accounts are
labeled 0000000a, 0000000b, and so on. Note that the keys may not be
listed in consecutive order. Locate the key containing the account you
want to delete, and then delete the key. After you delete the key, quit
Registry Editor and restart your computer.
