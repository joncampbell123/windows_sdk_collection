The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Outlook Express version 4.0 for Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Outlook Express version 4.0 for Windows NT 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to attach a file that is on the desktop to a message in
Outlook Express, you may receive one of the following error messages:

<UL><LI>c:\winnt\profiles\&lt;name&gt;\desktop\&lt;filename&gt;
   File not found.
   Please verify the correct file name was given.

<LI>C:\WINDOWS\DESKTOP\&lt;filename&gt;
   This file cannot be found.
   Make sure that the correct path and filename are given.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These error messages can occur if the file you are trying to attach is
located in the All Users\Desktop folder.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this behavior, drag the file from the desktop to the
message window.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
These error messages do not occur if the file you are trying to attach is
located in the Windows\Desktop folder or the Desktop folder located in
your user profile folder.
<P>
The settings in the All Users folder are used with the settings in your
user profile folder to create your profile. Settings in the All Users
folder are always available to anyone that logs on to Windows. Settings in
your user profile folder are your personal settings and are only available
to you.
<P>
The settings for all users are located in the following folder by default:
<P>
<PRE>   Folder                        Platform
   ----------------------------------------
   C:\Winnt\Profiles\All Users   Windows NT
   C:\Windows\All Users          Windows 95

</PRE>Your personal settings are located in the following folder by default,
where &lt;name&gt; is the name you used to log on to Windows:
<P>
<PRE>   Folder                        Platform
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   C:\Winnt\Profiles\&lt;name&gt;      Windows NT
   C:\Windows\Profiles\&lt;name&gt;    Windows 95 with user profiles enabled
   C:\Windows                    Windows 95 without user profiles enabled

</PRE>Note that in Windows 95, the user profile folder is created only if you
have enabled user profiles. If user profiles are not enabled, settings are
saved to the appropriate folder in the Windows folder and are available to
anyone that logs on to Windows. You do not need to enable user profiles in
Windows NT 4.0. User profiles are enabled by default in Windows NT 4.0.
<P>
For more information about user profiles in Windows 95, see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
