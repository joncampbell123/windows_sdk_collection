The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 3.0, 3.01, 3.02 for
   Windows 95
<LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 3.0, 3.01, 3.02 for
   Windows NT 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to start any of the versions of Internet Explorer listed
at the beginning of this article after upgrading from a previous version
of Internet Explorer, the following error message may be displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   Shdocvw.dll could not be found in specified path.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem is known to occur when the following conditions are true:

<UL><LI>Your computer is configured as a dual-boot system (that is, it is
   configured to run both Windows 95 and Windows NT).
<P>
   -and-

<LI>You installed your previous version of Internet Explorer in both
   Windows 95 and Windows NT.
<P>
</UL>If you upgrade one installation of Internet Explorer, but not the other,
the error message is displayed when you attempt to start the installation
of Internet Explorer that you did not upgrade.
<P>
Note that this problem occurs only when your previous versions of Internet
Explorer for Windows 95 and Internet Explorer for Windows NT were
installed in the same folder.
<P>
When you install Internet Explorer, both the Internet Explorer for Windows
95 and Internet Explorer for Windows NT files are updated. However, only
the registry and files associated with the operating system that is
currently running are updated. Because the registry and files associated
with the other operating system are not updated, Internet Explorer does
not run properly when you start that operating system.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, upgrade both installations of Internet Explorer.
