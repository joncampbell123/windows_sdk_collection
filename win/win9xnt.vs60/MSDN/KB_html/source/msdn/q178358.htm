<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article includes information about using Internet Explorer with the
October 1997 release of the Microsoft Developer Network Library (MSDN).
<P>
In order for the MSDN Library to function properly, Microsoft Internet
Explorer version 3.01 or higher should be installed on your system. The
version of Internet Explorer that you install, should be a released non-
beta version, Internet Explorer 4.0 is fully supported. There are some
features and known problems using Internet Explorer 4.0 with the MSDN
Library that are addressed in this document.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h2>Installing Internet Explorer with the MSDN Library</h2>
 
<P>
If you do not have Internet Explorer 3.01 or higher installed, you will be
prompted during MSDN Setup to install Internet Explorer version 3.02. When
you select Yes, MSDN setup will halt and display a dialog box saying, "MSDN
Setup was not completed successfully." You must click OK, complete Internet
Explorer setup, and then reboot. You must then restart MSDN setup. If you
select No, you will be required to install Internet Explorer manually.
<P>
The U.S. English Internet Explorer Version 3.02b, which includes the
Authenticode 2.0 update, is available on the October 1997 MSDN Library CD1
in the \IE subdirectory. To install, run the file Msie302.exe.
<P>
To download the latest version of Internet Explorer 4.0, connect to

<P>
<P><h2>Using Internet Explorer 4.0</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>Accessibility Enhancements</h3>
 
<P>
Internet Explorer 4.0 includes some new accessibility features that can be
used within InfoViewer and the MSDN Library. You now have the ability to
specify your own color, font, style settings so that your settings always
override settings specified by an MSDN topic or Web site. You can change
these settings in Internet Explorer 4.0 by selecting Internet Options from
the View menu, then clicking on the Accessibility button under the General
tab. You can modify the following settings.
<P>
<P><h3>Ignore Colors Specified on Web Pages</h3>
 
<P>
This option specifies whether you want Internet Explorer to use the color
settings you choose for text, background, and links. You can set these
colors on the General tab by clicking the Colors button. If the author of a
Web page chooses different colors for text and background, the settings you
choose here will override them. You cannot change the size or color of
graphics.
<P>
<P><h3>Ignore Font Styles Specified on Web Pages</h3>
 
<P>
The option specifies whether you want Internet Explorer to use the font
settings you choose. You can set these types on the General tab by clicking
the Fonts button. If the author of a Web page chooses different fonts, the
settings you choose here will override them. You cannot change the size or
color of graphics.
<P>
<P><h3>Ignore Font Sizes Specified on Web Pages</h3>
 
<P>
This option specifies whether you want Internet Explorer to use the default
font size you choose. You can set the default font size on the General tab
by clicking the Fonts button. If the author of a Web page chooses a
different default font size, the settings you choose here will override it.
You cannot change the size or color of graphics.
<P>
<P><h3>User Style Sheet</h3>
 
<P>
This option specifies whether you want Internet Explorer to use your own
style sheet to format all Web pages when they are displayed, and provides a
place for you to type the path to your style sheet. Style sheets can
specify the default font style, size, colors, and background for the body
text in addition to headings.
<P>
<P><h3>Problems Accessing Sample Data</h3>
 
<P>
Users of the Integrated Development Environment for Microsoft Visual C++
5.0, Visual InterDev 1.0, or Visual J++ 1.1 who also have Microsoft
Internet Explorer 4.0 installed will receive the following error when
selecting a URL in an MSDN title that accesses samples:
<P>
<PRE>   Error Accessing Sample Data

</PRE>Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Visual Studio 97
development products. This problem was corrected in Visual Studio 97
service Pack 2. The Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2 is available from the
Microsoft Web Site at <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/vstudio/sp/">http://www.microsoft.com/vstudio/sp/.</A></B>
<P>
For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<P>
<PRE>   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../vstudio/q170365.htm">Q170365</A></B>
   TITLE     : INFO: Visual Studio 97 Service Packs - What, Where, and Why

</PRE>This bug also affects the standalone versions of the MSDN Library prior to
October 1997. The October release of the Microsoft Development Library
includes an update required by Internet Explorer 4.0 users who want to
access samples from within an MSDN title. This update affects only the MSDN
executable, Iv5.exe. Users of the IDE who wish to benefit from this fix as
well can get it one of two ways:

<UL><LI>Install the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Copy the file containing the fix, Ivauto.dll, from the MSDN CD1 to the
   directory containing IDE executable. For example, if you installed
   Visual C++ to its default directory, C:\Program Files\DevStudio, you
   would copy Ivauto.dll as follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      From:  Disc 1 subdirectory  \x86\bin\IVAUTO.DLL
      To:  C:\Program Files\DevStudio\SharedIDE\Bin\IVAUTO.DLL
</PRE><P>
</UL><h3>Problem with Font Sizes Appearing Very Small in Some Topics</h3>
 
<P>
This problem is caused by changes in stylesheet support in Internet
Explorer 4.0. The best workaround is to change your accessibility settings
in Internet Explorer 4.0 and choose to ignore font sizes. This problem will
be fixed in the documentation of a future release of the MSDN Library.
<P>
<P><h3>Problem with Very Narrow Table Columns in MFC Documentation</h3>
 
<P>
Some documentation for MFC in Visual C++ 5.0 will appear improperly
formatted when using Internet Explorer 4.0. The Class Members topics in the
Class Library reference uses table columns that are formatted incorrectly
using hardcoded point sizes. The descriptions display as a very narrow
column. There is no good workaround for this problem. The MSDN team will
fix this in the next quarterly library release.
<P>
<P><h3>Transact SQL Topic is Blacked Out</h3>
 
<P>
This problem is caused by a mistake in the underlying HTML. The background
color setting is incorrectly authored. The good news is there is no
documentation in this section. It is a simple reference to the new location
of the Transact SQL documentation. The documentation titled "Transact-SQL
Reference" is now integrated with the Platform SDK documentation on the
MSDN Library. You can find this information in the Microsoft SQL Server
Programmer's Toolkit located in the Database and Messaging Services section
of the Platform SDK.
<P>
<P><h3>Known Problems in Internet Explorer 4.0 Beta Preview Releases</h3>
 

<UL><LI>Downloading samples from an MSDN topic did not work at all in some
   Internet Explorer 4.0 preview releases. This was fixed in newer
   releases. Connect to <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/">http://www.microsoft.com/ie/</A></B> to download the latest
   version of Internet Explorer.

<LI>Downloading samples with a space in the filename does not work. You may
   receive the following error message:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Error copying file
</PRE><P>
   If you experience this problem then you may need to use Internet
   Explorer 3.02 or download the file from the MSDN Library Online at
   http:/microsoft.com/msdn/library/.

<LI>Some Internet Explorer 4.0 beta releases had prevented InfoViewer users
   from changing the font size of topics. This has been corrected. Connect
   to <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/">http://www.microsoft.com/ie/</A></B> to download the latest version of
   Internet Explorer.

<LI>Some Internet Explorer 4.0 preview releases caused crashes when viewing
   InfoViewer Titles if ratings were enabled. This has also been fixed.
