The information in this article applies to:
<P>
- Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Development Platform and
<PRE>  Development Library for Windows and Windows NT
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) publishes two unique products:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Development Library
<LI>Microsoft Development Platform
<P>
</UL>These two products are different from the vast majority of software
products. First, they are subscription products, updated and released anew
each quarter. Second, they are benefits of a membership program: the
Microsoft Development Library comes with MSDN Level 1, and the Microsoft
Development Platform comes with MSDN Level 2.
<P>
Because these two products are so unusual, their licensing plans are also
unusual. As a result, MSDN members often have questions about licensing.
This article provides the answers to some of the most frequently asked
questions.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 

<OL><P><LI>How Do the Development Library and the Development Platform Differ?
</OL> 
<P>
The Library contains all the technical reference material you need to
develop Windows-based software, including technical articles, sample source
code, books, journal articles, Microsoft technical white papers and
specifications, as well as documentation for SDKs, DDKs, and tools such as
Visual C++ and Visual Basic.
<P>
The Platform contains most of the software development kits (SDKs) and
device driver kits (DDKs) Microsoft produces, along with current versions
of all Microsoft operating systems. Operating systems are provided for the
sole purpose of developing and testing your applications.

<OL><P><LI>Does MSDN Publish Compilers?
</OL> 
<P>
MSDN is not in the business of distributing or selling compilers. Neither
the Platform nor the Library provides compilers available via retailers.
The Development Platform sometimes includes beta compilers for use with
beta or pre-release operating systems; however, as soon as an operating
system is released, MSDN removes the corresponding beta compiler from the
Platform.

<OL><P><LI>What Do the MSDN Licenses Let Me Do?
</OL> 
<P>
The Development Library and the Development Platform are licensed for use
by specific individuals. When you join MSDN level 1 or 2, you are the sole
licensee for these products. If an organization purchases MSDN level 1 or
2, then one specific individual must be designated as the MSDN member and
licensee for the Library (level 1) or the Platform (level 2).

<OL><P><LI>Can My Workgroup Use the Development Library over the Network?
</OL> 
<P>
The MSDN network licensing plan allows large groups of developers to access
the Development Library economically over a network. Level 1 memberships
can be arranged for groups of developers in three ways:

<UL><LI>You can purchase additional single-user licenses at an annual cost of
   $40 US or $55 CAN each. These licenses give a designated individual the
   right to access the software in the Development Library.

<LI>You can purchase a five-concurrent-user license for the Development
   Library for $595 US or $835 CAN.

<LI>You can purchase a 25-concurrent-user license for the Development
   Library for $2,495 US or $3,495 CAN.
<P>
</UL>The last two membership options allow you to connect or download the CD
to a single server and permit any number of developers to install the
Development Library browser software. But no more than five or 25
developers, respectively, can run the browser software at any given time.

<OL><P><LI>Can I Share the Development Platform with Others in My Organization?
</OL> 
<P>
MSDN Level 2 membership includes a single-user license for the Development
Library and Development Platform. Microsoft licenses operating systems,
SDKs, and DDKs on a single-user-only basis.

<OL><P><LI>Am I Allowed to Give My Old CDs to Friends or Co-workers?
</OL> 
<P>
In short, no. As new issues of the Development Library and Platform are
released, you may continue to use the previous releases. However, the
license agreement does not allow you (as the sole licensee) to hand your
old releases to someone else. If your membership expires, you may continue
to use your Development Library and Platform CDs.

<OL><P><LI>Can I Use MSDN Sample Code in My Own Software?
</OL> 
<P>
You may, as part of your own applications, use and modify the source code
version, as well as reproduce and distribute the object code version of the
sample code, icons, cursors, and bitmaps provided in the Sample Code bin of
the Development Library.

<OL><P><LI>What About Licensing for Beta Software on the Development Platform?
</OL> 
<P>
The Development Platform contains some beta software subject to special
licensing restrictions. The license for most beta software expires the
moment Microsoft ships a final, retail version of the software. You can
check the \LICENSE directory on the Development Platform to find unusual
licensing provisions associated with specific beta software.

<OL><P><LI>Does the MSDN License Let Me Make Copies of Articles, Code, or Other
</OL>Content in the Library?
 
<P>
You may make unlimited copies (print or soft copy) of any content in the
Development Library, as long as it is for internal purposes. For example,
you can share it with a fellow developer who runs into a roadblock and
doesn't have an MSDN membership.
<P>
You may not, however, use the content for external purposes. For example,
you may not use it as part of a training manual for clients, nor may you
post content to a bulletin board system. Nor are you permitted to use or
modify copies of the content in original works of your own without
permission. If you are interested in such a thing, you will need to contact
the Permissions Department at Microsoft, either by mailing them at One
Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052, or faxing to their attention at (206) 936-
7329.

<OL><P><LI>Can I Redistribute Any of the DLLs or Operating Systems on the
</OL>Development Platform?
 
<P>
You may not redistribute any of the operating systems. Much of the sample
code and various components in the SDKs and DDKs are redistributable, but
you need to read the individual license agreements in the \LICENSE
directory on the Development Platform to find out exactly which components
are redistributable. The Development Platform License Agreement contains
the legal requirements you need to meet when redistributing components of
the toolkits on the Platform.
