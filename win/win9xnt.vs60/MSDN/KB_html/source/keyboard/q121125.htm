<P>
 
<P><h2>Part 1: Running the Setup Program</h2>
 
<P>
Use the Run command from Program Manager or File Manager to start SETUP.EXE
as you would any other Windows-based application. For example, if you are
installing from drive A:

<OL><P><LI>From the File menu in Program Manager, choose Run.
</OL>2. In the Run dialog box, type A:SETUP and choose OK.
<P>
<PRE>   - Or -

</PRE></OL>&gt;  From File Manager, double-click the SETUP.EXE file
<PRE>   in drive A.


</PRE> 
<P><h2>Part 2: Using MS-DOS Disk Caching Software During Setup</h2>
 
<P>
If you use MS-DOS disk cache software other than Microsoft SMARTDrive, then
don't choose "Reboot" after completing setup. Instead choose "Exit" then
exit Windows and reboot your machine manually.
<P>
Some DOS disk-caching programs use a write-behind caching technique. If the
cache isn't flushed before rebooting, disk errors could occur.
<P>
<P>
 
<P><h2>Part 3: Using Microsoft Windows Task List</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft IntelliType software replaces the Microsoft Windows Task List
with Task Manager. If you'd like to go back to using the Task List, follow
this procedure (for Microsoft Windows 3.x only):

<OL><P><LI>Find the line in the [boot] section in SYSTEM.INI (located in
   your Windows directory) that reads:
<P>
<P><PRE>      taskman.exe=tasksw16.exe
</PRE>
<P><LI>Change it to read:
<P>
<P><PRE>      taskman.exe=taskman.exe
</PRE><P>
<P>
</OL> 
<P><h2>Part 4: If You Are Using Microsoft Windows NT(TM)</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using the IntelliType software with Microsoft Windows NT, please
note the following restrictions:
<P>
*  This version of the Microsoft IntelliType software
<PRE>   supports x86 platforms only.  You cannot install the
   software to another platform such as MIPS or Alpha.

</PRE></OL>*  Pointer wrap is not available in Microsoft Windows NT, and
<PRE>   will appear grayed out on the Pointer Activity tab.
   Future releases of Microsoft Windows NT may support
   Pointer Wrap.

</PRE>*  To open Microsoft Windows NT Task List, press CTRL+ESC or
<PRE>   double-click on the desktop. If you want to open Task Manager
   instead, press the left or right Microsoft Windows key.
   However, you can't open Task Manager if an MS-DOS command
   shell (MS-DOS window) has the focus.

</PRE>*  When using Task Manager, you may in some cases get a network
<PRE>   access violation error if you choose the Network button
   on the Configure Buttons dialog box.  This situation is fixed
   in Microsoft Windows NT version 3.5.

</PRE>*  IMPORTANT: Some applications, such as Microsoft Visual C++
<PRE>   version 2, written using the UNICODE character set (as
   opposed to the ANSI character set), crash when you run
   the Microsoft IntelliType software on a computer
   with Microsoft Windows NT version 3.1.  This problem is
   resolved in Microsoft Windows NT version 3.5.

</PRE>*  You may experience keyboard and mouse problems if you use
<PRE>   the Microsoft Natural Keyboard software with Microsoft Access
   version 2.0 on the Microsoft Windows NT version 3.5 platform.


</PRE> 
<P><h2>Part 5: Turning MouseKey Feedback Off</h2>
 
<P>
MouseKey enables you to use the numeric keypad to move the pointer. You can
toggle this feature on and off by pressing LEFT SHIFT + LEFT ALT + NUM
LOCK. If you would like to turn off the audio feedback that the MouseKey
toggle generates, follow this procedure:

<OL><P><LI>Open the MSINPUT.INI file (located in the directory that holds
   the Microsoft IntelliType software) and find the following
   entry in the [WindowsPointers] section:
<P>
<P><PRE>      MouseKeyFeedback=ON
</PRE>
<P><LI>Change it to read:
<P>
<P><PRE>      MouseKeyFeedback=OFF
</PRE><P>
<P>
</OL> 
<P><h2>Part 6: Using Remote Control Software</h2>
 
<P>
IMPORTANT: When you load the Microsoft IntelliType software, Setup installs
the Microsoft Natural Keyboard driver over any other keyboard driver
previously installed on your system. For example, if you have installed a
remote control application such as pcANYWHERE or Carbon Copy, the Microsoft
Natural Keyboard driver replaces the driver for that application and
prevents it from working.
<P>
You can use remote control software with the Microsoft Natural Keyboard,
but not with the IntelliType software. To use the remote control software,
uninstall the Microsoft IntelliType software, using the procedures given
below. Then reinstall the remote control software to reset the keyboard
driver.
<P>
<P>
 
<P><h2>Part 7: Using Command-Line Switches in MS-DOS</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using the MS-DOS version of the software, you can type
<P>
<PRE>     kbdcpl.exe /?

</PRE></OL>at the prompt to see a list of available switches.
<P>
<P>
 
<P><h2>Part 8: A Fix for Visual SlickEdit</h2>
 
<P>
If you run any version of Visual SlickEdit older than version 1.6, you may
find that the application's hot keys don't work from the Microsoft Natural
Keyboard. A fix for this problem is available by contacting MicroEdge at
(919) 790-1691.
<P>
<P>
 
<P><h2>Part 9: Using Microsoft IntelliType Software with Laptops</h2>
 
<P>
Do not install the Microsoft IntelliType software on any Texas Instrument
laptop that uses the 710 chip and on which you are running Microsoft
Windows NT. Installing the software causes the laptop's mouse to hang.
<P>
<P>
 
Part 10: If You Boot from a Floppy Disk
 
<P>
When you install IntelliType Manager, Setup modifies the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
located on your default hard drive (normally c:). If for some reason you
boot Microsoft Windows from a floppy disk, you will have to copy the two
lines of information that were added to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file on your hard
drive to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file located on your boot disk manually. The two
lines are:
<P>
<PRE>   SET MSINPUT=C:\MSINPUT
   C:\MSINPUT\KEYBOARD\KBDCPL.EXE /S

</PRE>(The target directory will be different if you installed IntelliType
Manager in a different directory.)
<P>
<P>
 
<P><h2>Part 11: Using the Keypad to Draw in Microsoft Paintbrush</h2>
 
<P>
If you enable the "Use Numeric Keypad as Mouse" option on the Pointer
Control tab, you can use the keypad to draw in Microsoft Paintbrush. To
draw (or erase), press the Drag Lock key (the 0 key on the keypad). That
puts you in draw mode. To return to normal pointer mode, press the Drag
Release key (the period key on the keypad).
<P>
IMPORTANT: If you are working in Paintbrush and using the numeric keypad,
return to pointer mode before opening Task Manager. If you open Task
Manager while in draw mode, you may hang your system and have to reboot
Paintbrush.
<P>
<P>
 
<P><h2>Part 12: If You Have Increased Security in Microsoft Mail</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft Mail allows you to increase the security of your mail by
requiring your password whenever you restore a minimized Mail icon. (You do
this by changing the setting for Security in the MSMAIL.INI file. See Help
for Microsoft Mail for more information.)
<P>
However, if you have set this security feature, you cannot use Task Manager
to switch to Microsoft Mail when it is minimized. Instead, use either
ALT+TAB to switch to Microsoft Mail or double-click the Mail icon.
<P>
<P>
 
<P><h2>Part 13: Snap-To May Snap Too Often</h2>
 
<P>
If you encounter a dialog box in which the focus returns to the default
button after each individual action (such as selecting custom options
during Setup), disable the Snap-to feature on the Pointer Activity tab
until you finish the current operation.
<P>
<P>
 
<P><h2>Part 14: CAPS LOCK Can't Be Disabled in MS-DOS Window</h2>
 
<P>
In Microsoft Windows 3.x, the Caps Lock Key Disabled button (on the
Keyboard Options tab) does not disable CAPS LOCK within an MS-DOS window.
This option does work in all Microsoft Windows 3.x applications and
Microsoft Windows NT applications and within the MS-DOS window (command
shell) in Microsoft Windows NT.
<P>
<P>
 
<P><h2>Part 15: If Keyboard Sounds Begin Repeating</h2>
 
<P>
If you have turned on the sound effects for the keyboard and find that the
sound repeats continually after pressing a key, you may be experiencing an
interrupt conflict. You can either turn off the sound effect (choose Sounds
Off on the Keyboard Options tab) or change your sound card Interrupt
setting to resolve this problem.
<P>
<P>
 
<P><h2>Part 16: If You Use CorelDraw, Disable Snap-to</h2>
 
<P>
If you use the Zoom In feature in CorelDraw, be sure to turn off (disable)
the Snap-to option on the Pointer Activity tab. This Zoom In feature will
not work if Snap-to is enabled.
<P>
<P>
 
<P><h2>Part 17: Pointer Wrap Can Limit Drag and Drop</h2>
 
<P>
Pointer Wrap can affect the functionality of Drag and Drop in some
applications. If you find that Drag and Drop is not working properly, be
sure to disable Pointer Wrap on the Pointer Activity tab.
<P>
<P>
 
<P><h2>Part 18: Uninstalling the IntelliType Software in Windows 3.x</h2>
 
<P>
The Help topic on uninstalling the Microsoft Natural Keyboard software is
incomplete. To return your system to its previous condition before you ran
the Microsoft Natural Keyboard Setup program, follow the procedures below.

<OL><P><LI>Delete all files in the C:\MSINPUT\KEYBOARD directory (or
   whatever target directory you specified during setup). If
   \KEYBOARD is the only subdirectory, you can delete the \MSINPUT
   directory as well. If there are other subdirectories,
   indicating that other input device software (such as a mouse)
   is installed in \MSINPUT, do NOT delete the directory.

<P><LI>Delete the files TASKSW16.EXE and TASKMAN.HLP from your Windows
   directory.

<P><LI>Delete the IntelliType Manager, Task Manager, and IntelliType
   Readme icons from the Microsoft Input Devices program group.
   (Single-click on the icon and press DELETE.) If the program
   group is empty, you can delete it also.

<P><LI>Open the SYSTEM.INI file (located in your Windows directory)

   shown if there are no other Microsoft input devices installed:
<P>
<P><PRE>     [386Enh]
     Keyboard=*vkd
</PRE><P>
   Do NOT change this setting if there are other Microsoft
   input devices installed.

<P><LI>If there are no other Microsoft input devices installed,
   delete "C:\MSINPUT\POINTER.EXE" from the "load=" line in
   the [windows] section of the WIN.INI file. Do NOT remove
   this value or any other values for this setting if there
   are other Microsoft input devices installed.

<P><LI>Open the CONTROL.INI file. Remove the line
<P>

   section.

<P><LI>Open the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and delete the following line:
<P>
<P><PRE>     c:\msinput\keyboard\kbdcpl.exe /s
</PRE>
<P><LI>Reboot Microsoft Windows to reinitialize your settings.
<P>
<P>
</OL> 
<P><h2>Part 19: Uninstalling the IntelliType Software in Windows NT</h2>
 
<P>
Note:  You must have a user account with Administration
<PRE>       security privileges to uninstall the IntelliType
       software in Windows NT.

</PRE><P><LI>In the Command Shell or in File Manager, check the
   \MSINPUT directory to see if \KEYBOARD is the only
   subdirectory. If it is, then go to step 2. If there
   are other subdirectories, indicating that you have other
   Microsoft input devices installed, then go to step 3.
<P>
   Note:  The directory path may be different if you specified
<PRE>          a different target directory during Setup.

</PRE><P><LI>Perform the following operations if \KEYBOARD is the ONLY
   subdirectory of the \MSINPUT directory. If there is another
   input device installed in this directory, skip this step and
   go on to step 3.
<P>
