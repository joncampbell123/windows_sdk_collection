The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Mouse Driver versions 9.0, 9.01
<LI>Microsoft IntelliPoint software version 1.0
<LI>Microsoft Natural Keyboard with IntelliType software version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 

<UL><LI>Wave (.WAV) files play in a continuous loop when you run Windows, and
   the computer stops responding (hangs), requiring that you reboot the
   system to break out of the loop.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>The system hangs and requires a reboot because of other conflicts
   between peripherals.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These problems can occur after you install the version 9.0 or 9.01
Microsoft Mouse driver, which in turn installs MOUSEVKD.386 in Windows.
This new virtual keyboard driver causes conflicts with peripherals that use
Interrupt (IRQ) 12.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 

<UL><LI>Change the peripherals to interrupts other than IRQ 12 to eliminate
   conflicts.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>If you are using a serial mouse, you can install the older native
   Windows virtual keyboard driver. To make this change, the KEYBOARD= line
   in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file must be changed from
<P>
<P><PRE>      [386Enh]
      keyboard=C:\&lt;MOUSE&gt;\MOUSEVKD.386
</PRE><P>
   (where &lt;MOUSE&gt; is the directory containing the 9.0 or 9.01 driver)
<P>
   to:
<P>
<P><PRE>      keyboard=*VKD
</PRE><P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows virtual keyboard driver (*VKD) is replaced with MOUSEVKD.386
when you install Microsoft Mouse driver version 9.0 or 9.01. This virtual
driver(VxD) affects the way the 8042 keyboard controller chip is handled.
This is primarily for synchronization of the PS/2-style mouse. (The PS/2-
style mouse interface is connected through this chip.) IRQ 12 is dedicated
to the PS/2-style interface at the hardware level. This is defined by the
hardware architecture and cannot be changed.
<P>
Peripheral devices that allow selection of IRQ 12 can create interrupt
conflicts, causing the system to hang when the new VxD is loaded. The VxD
is controlling the PS/2 port and thus responding to IRQ 12.
<P>
This problem also occurs with the IntelliPoint 1.0 MSINPUT.386 file.
<P>
NOTE: MOUSEVKD.386 is required only if a PS/2-style mouse is installed. A
serial mouse works correctly with the *VKD and the 9.0 or 9.01 driver, but
a PS/2-style mouse is erratic if the 9.0 or 9.01 driver is used without
MOUSEVKD.386 installed.
