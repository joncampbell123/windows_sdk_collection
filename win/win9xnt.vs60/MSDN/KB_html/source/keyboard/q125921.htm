The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Natural Keyboard with IntelliType software version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After you choose the Configure Buttons button in the IntelliType Task
Manager, the Files and Directories windows overlap vertically, making it
difficult to view their contents.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior can occur if you install the IntelliType software in a
third-party Windows shell (such as Norton Desktop).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this behavior, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Open the SYSTEM.INI file in the Windows directory in any text editor
   (such as Notepad). In the [Boot] section of the file, comment out the
   "Shell=&lt;third-party shell&gt;" line by placing a semicolon (;) at the
   beginning of the line.

<P><LI>Insert the following new line in the [Boot] section:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Shell=Progman.exe
</PRE>
<P><LI>Save and then close the SYSTEM.INI file. Quit and restart Microsoft
   Windows.

<P><LI>Confirm that the Files and Directories windows appear correctly.

<P><LI>Replace the third-party shell and test for compatibility by confirming
   that the Files and Directories windows appear correctly.
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The IntelliType Task Manager replaces the original Windows Task List during
installation. The IntelliType Task Manager acts as both a task swapper and
a program launcher. You can invoke Task Manager by double-clicking the
desktop, pressing CTRL+ESC, or by pressing the Windows key on the Microsoft
Natural Keyboard. You can assign the launcher buttons to function keys on
the keyboard by choosing Configure Buttons in Task Manager and selecting
.EXE, .PIF, .BAT, or .COM files.
<P>
Third-party shells are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
