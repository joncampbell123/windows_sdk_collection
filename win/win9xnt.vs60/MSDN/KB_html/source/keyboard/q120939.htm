The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Natural Keyboard with IntelliType software version 1.0
<LI>Microsoft IntelliPoint software version 1.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you install a Windows-level MSINPUT device (IntelliType or
IntelliPoint) on a system with an existing installation of the Microsoft
IntelliType software or Microsoft IntelliPoint software with the MS-DOS
level components only, the settings for IntelliType or IntelliPoint are not
read correctly.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When you install IntelliPoint or IntelliType, the following additional line
is added to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
<P>
<PRE>   SET MSINPUT=C:\MSINPUT

</PRE>This environment variable sets the location of the MSINPUT.INI file where
the settings for both IntelliType and IntelliPoint are located.
<P>
If IntelliType or IntelliPoint is installed with only MS-DOS-level
components to a drive or directory other than the default (C:\MSINPUT), a
second installation with Windows-level components overrides the first
installation settings by changing the SET environment variable path for the
MSINPUT.INI file. Functionality of either IntelliType or IntelliPoint may
appear to be lost.
<P>
The settings for both IntelliType and IntelliPoint must reside in the same
MSINPUT.INI file.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Make sure that both IntelliType and IntelliPoint are installed to the same
drive and directory. If it is not possible to reinstall the second MSINPUT
device to the same directory and path as the first, use the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Edit the MSINPUT.INI file to reflect both IntelliType and IntelliPoint
   settings.

<P><LI>Edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to reflect the correct drive and path for the
   SET MSINPUT=&lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;path&gt; environment variable.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Natural Keyboard
with IntelliType and Microsoft Home and Standard Mouse with IntelliPoint
versions 1.00. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
You do not receive a warning message when installing a second MSINPUT
device at the Windows level when the first MSINPUT device was installed
with only MS-DOS-level components on a drive or directory other than
C:\MSINPUT. However, the second installation does change the SET
MSINPUT=&lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;path&gt; statement found in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, leaving
two separate incomplete MSINPUT.INI files, only one of which is actually
read.
