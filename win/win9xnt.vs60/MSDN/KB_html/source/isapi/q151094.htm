<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: The following acronyms are used within this article:
<P>
- Internet Information Server (IIS)
- Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
- Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI)
- Dynamic Link Library (DLL)
- Software Development Kit (SDK)
- World Wide Web (WWW)
<P>
Below is a description of three common server extension technologies.
<P>
<P><h3>ISAPI Extensions</h3>
 
<P>
ISAPI server extensions are implemented as DLL files. A small set of
functions allow the DLL to communicate with the WWW server. The DLL
actually becomes part of the WWW server. ISAPI extensions are by far the
fastest. Because function pointers are used to communicate with the server,
languages that cannot accommodate function pointers cannot be used (for
example, Microsoft Visual Basic).
<P>
<P><h3>CGI Applications</h3>
 
<P>
CGI server extensions are implemented as console applications. Input and
output are communicated with normal standard input, standard output, and
environment variables. CGI EXEs run in their own process space, and one
process is created per request. Some languages do not support standard
input, standard output, and/or environment variables.
<P>
<P><h3>Windows CGI Applications</h3>
 
<P>
Windows CGI server extensions are implemented as Windows-based GUI
applications. INI files (profiles) and temporary files are used to
communicate input and output. For each request, an INI file is created,
along with all necessary temporary files. Output is written to a pre-
designated temporary file. While writing a Microsoft Visual Basic
application conformant with Windows CGI is easy, the interface is dependent
on files and is inherently slow.
<P>
IIS directly supports two types of server extensions: CGI executables and
ISAPI DLLs. All other interfaces are supported through either CGI or ISAPI.
Specifically, IIS supports Windows CGI executables (usually written with
Microsoft Visual Basic) through the use of an ISAPI DLL.
<P>
Windows CGI support is available via the IS2WCGI sample provided in the
Win32 SDK. Is2wcgi.dll, an ISAPI application, translates the ISAPI
environment into the Windows CGI environment. This article provides tips on
running existing Windows CGI applications with IS2WCGI.
<P>
NOTE: The Windows CGI specification is totally different than the CGI
specification. Do not confuse the two.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Windows CGI applications are Windows-based executables, commonly written
with Microsoft Visual Basic. The Windows CGI spec (authored by Robert B.
Denny) first appeared in the O'Reilly Website product.
<P>
In order to translate ISAPI into Windows CGI, IS2WCGI does the following
three things:

<UL><LI>It formats inbound browser data according to the Windows CGI spec.

<LI>It runs the Windows CGI executable.

<LI>It passes output to the browser via ISAPI.
<P>
</UL>Several things can go wrong in this process, and here are some of the most
common problems.
<P>
TEST 1: Does Is2wcgi.dll work with Is2wcgi.exe on your computer?
<P>
The first step to determining the problem is to make sure the DLL is
functional using the sample Windows CGI executable provided. Is2wcgi.dll
and Is2wcgi.exe must be in the same directory, and they are copied to
C:\Inetsrv\Scripts\Sdk by the Win32 SDK makefiles.

<OL><P><LI>Make sure you are using the latest version of Is2wcgi.dll. Check
   www.microsoft.com/intdev for updates of the Win32 SDK.

<P><LI>To be safe, shut down all IIS services (FTP, WWW, and Gopher) with the
   administration tool, and then start them again. This will force
   all IIS service components to reload.

<P><LI>Test your installation of IIS by using a browser to view the default
   HTML page. Make sure this page is not cached by the browser (choose
   reload).

<P><LI>Verify that the DLL and EXE are located in the same directory.
   Use the IIS administration tool to verify that the directory is listed
   as a virtual root and has execute permission (and only execute
   permission). Read permission is inappropriate for server extensions.
   It is OK to use a child directory when the parent is marked as a
   virtual root with execute permission.

<P><LI>Enter your server's web address (the URL) manually with your browser,
   followed by a path to Is2wcgi.dll. For example, type:
<P>
<P><PRE>      <B>http://myserver/scripts/sdk/is2wcgi.dll</B>
</PRE><P>
</OL>Specifying the DLL in the link (instead of the EXE) requires an important
change in your Windows CGI application's output: extensions may be hard-
coded in links within your Windows CGI application. These must be
changed from .EXE to .DLL, and each Windows CGI application must have its
own copy of Is2wcgi.dll, renamed appropriately and located in the same
sub-directory as the Windows CGI executable.
<P>
After you complete step 6, you should get a reply back from the server
reflecting the profile created by the Is2wcgi dll. If this works, go to
Test 6 below.
<P>
TEST 2: Upon receiving a reply, is the browser asking you to save
<PRE>        something?

</PRE></OL>This is one of the most common problems. If read access is set on the
directory containing Is2wcgi.dll, the server will send the DLL instead of
running it. See Test 1.
<P>
TEST 3: Is the IUSR_Guest and SYSTEM account set up properly?
<P>
IIS creates a guest account for anonymous web accesses during installation.
Verify that an account similar to IUSR_YourMachineName has read, write,
create, delete, and execute permission in the directory containing
Is2wcgi.dll. Remember that the DLL creates temporary files, runs the
Windows CGI application, and deletes the files after it is done. Also,
remember that the IUSR account is part of the Guest group and inherits
guest restrictions. Is2wcgi.dlls HttpExtensionProc function will run in the
IUSR_Guest account, and the Windows CGI application will run in the local
system account. Any permissions granted to IUSR_Guest should also be
granted to the local system account.
<P>
If you discovered that IUSR_Guest or the local system account did not have
appropriate access, modify access, restart the WWW service, and go back to
Test 1.
<P>
TEST 4: Are all necessary DLLs available on your NT server? Do they have
<PRE>        appropriate permissions?

</PRE>Is2wcgi.dll may be dependent on the C runtime DLLs, unless you statically
link in the C runtimes during the build. Do the following to make sure all
runtime DLLs are available:

<OL><P><LI>Use a tool such as Dumpbin.exe to list the imports of Is2wcgi.dll.
   DUMPBIN comes with Microsoft Visual C++. Type the following from the
   command prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      DUMPBIN IS2WCGI.DLL /imports
</PRE>
<P><LI>Use the output of DUMPBIN to determine which DLLs are required.
   Kernel32.dll and User32.dll are part of Microsoft Windows NT. Another
   DLL such as Msvcrt40.dll may be listed and is not part of Windows NT.

<P><LI>Verify that all required DLLs are installed in the System32
   subdirectory of your Windows NT installation. C runtime DLLs come
   with the compiler.

<P><LI>Your Windows CGI executable may also be dependent on runtime DLLs. A
   Visual Basic application is dependent on VB runtimes (Vbrun300.dll for
   example). Verify that all required DLLs are installed in the System32
   subdirectory (or elsewhere in your system path).

<P><LI>Verify that both the SYSTEM account and the IUSR_Guest account have
   access to all necessary DLLs. For anonymous accesses, the DLL will
   run in the context of IUSR_Guest, and the Windows CGI EXE will run in
   the SYSTEM account. (The IUSR_Guest account on your machine will be
   named IUSR_Yourmachinename.)
<P>
</OL>If you added a missing DLL or changed security, go back to Test 1. Restart
the WWW service to flush cached account information.
<P>
TEST 5: Was the DLL ever loaded?
<P>
At this point, something was missed. Verify that IIS loaded the DLL by
copying over it or deleting it. When IIS is running and has Is2wcgi.dll
loaded, you will not be able to copy over it or delete it.
<P>
If Is2wcgi.dll was not ever loaded, start over and conduct careful
troubleshooting. If it is loaded, see other techniques below for more ideas
on how to troubleshoot.
<P>
TEST 6: Try Is2wcgi.dll with your form.
<P>
Use Is2wcgi.exe as a diagnostic tool for your form. Modify the ACTION
attribute in your HTML form so Is2wcgi.dll is executed. For example, the
FORM tag should look similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;FORM ACTION="http:/Scripts/SDK/IS2WCGI.DLL" METHOD=POST&gt;

</PRE></OL>Reload your HTML page on the browser and submit data to IIS. The reply will
reflect the Windows CGI profile (.INI file) created for your page.
<P>
TEST 7: Try your own Windows CGI app.
<P>
With Is2wcgi.exe working, you are ready to try your own Windows CGI
application. If your sample name is Sample.exe, copy the working copy of
Is2wcgi.dll to Sample.dll. The base names must always match.
<P>
Assuming your application is named SAMPLE.EXE, make sure your form ACTION
is running SAMPLE.DLL.
<P>
Load the form in your browser, then choose submit. If this does not work,
carefully go through each test again.
<P>
OTHER TECHNIQUES:
<P>
Windows CGI support is not built into the IIS WWW service, because
Is2wcgi.dll comes as a sample in the Win32 SDK. Because of this, you have
full source code to the translator and can modify it and improve it to suit
your needs. When troubleshooting, you might add MessageBox calls before all
return points and determine what HSE_ constant IS2WCGI.DLL is returning.
Remember to specify MB_SERVICE_NOTIFICATION because ISAPI DLLs are running
as a desktop-less service.
<P>
You might also make use of OutputDebugString and use Dbmon.exe to view the
debug messages. DBMON will not work unless the account that the ISAPI DLL
runs in has certain rights. You may also add IUSR_Guest to the
administrators group temporarily for debugging. Finally, you might run IIS
as a console application and step through IS2WCGI code line-by-line. See
the ActiveX Readme.txt for information about running IIS as a console
application.
<P>
Finally, there is a constant defined in Is2wcgi.cpp that may help.
Including the constant definition disables HTTP header processing by the
translator, and is necessary when your Windows CGI application does not
return header information. See the source code comments for details.
