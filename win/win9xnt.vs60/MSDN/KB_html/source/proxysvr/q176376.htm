The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Proxy Server version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to set up a manual packet filter using the "To allow a
specific internal computer behind Proxy Server to exchange packets" option,
the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   An Invalid Local Host Address was specified for a packet filter.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error is caused when the IP address specified for the filter is in
the Local Address Table (LAT).
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, remove the IP address from the LAT.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
One of the major features of Proxy Server version 2.0 is the ability to use
server proxying, which allows servers to be placed "behind" the proxy. This
means that external clients have access to these servers via the Proxy
Server computer's own external IP address. In effect, the service appears
to be running on the Proxy Server computer.
<P>
There are two ways in which this can be accomplished:
<P>
For services running on platforms that can support the Microsoft Winsock
Proxy Client (Windows NT - Intel &amp; Alpha, Windows 95, and Windows 3.x)
server proxy is configured by enabling dynamic packet filtering and
applying the correct Wspcfg.ini file as specified in the "Configuring
Server Proxy Parameters" section of the "Configuring Multiserver
Environments" chapter of the online documentation. These servers are
located on the internal side of the proxy and have IP addresses contained
in the Local Address Table (LAT). No manual packet filters need to be
created for this type of server Proxy; the dynamic packet filter will
automatically route packets.
<P>
For services running on platforms that do not support the Microsoft Winsock
Proxy Client, servers must be located in the so-called "demilitarized
zone." The DMZ is the area between the external network (usually the
Internet) and the external interface of the Proxy Server computer. These
servers are not strictly behind the Proxy Server computer but may be
shielded by it by the configuration of a manual packet filter as specified
in the "Packet Filters" section of the "Setting Security Parameters"
chapter of the online documentation.
