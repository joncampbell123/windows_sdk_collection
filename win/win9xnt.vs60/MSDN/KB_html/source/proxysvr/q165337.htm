<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The DCC Send option in the IRC application does not work because some
changes were added to the specification that describes how to make this
option work. These changes were not added as part of the Proxy Server Setup
program.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
NOTE: By following the guidelines below, the users have almost unlimited
access, so the administrator needs to decide if he/she wants to enable this
IRC feature.

<OL><P><LI>Edit the IRC protocol definition in the WSP admin, and add port
   range for subsequent connection 1024-5000 for TCP inbound
   connections.

<P><LI>Add a section to the configuration file similar to the following:
<P>
   ["IRC application name"]
   RemoteBindTcpPorts=0

<P><LI>If the IRC application is MIRC, click Setup on the File menu, and
   select Local Info. In the IP Address field, type the Internet
   IP address of the Proxy Server.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Microsoft Proxy Server
version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
