The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Proxy Server versions 1.0 and 2.0
<LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 2.0, 2.01, 2.1, 3.0, 3.01, 3.02
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you try to connect to a secure SSL site through Web Proxy (using
https://) you may be prompted for a password three times and receive an
Access Denied error message.
<P>
NOTE: This should only occur when you use Microsoft Internet Explorer
version 2.x and later in conjunction with Microsoft Windows NT
Challenge/Response authentication on the Proxy Server.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Upgrade to Internet Explorer version 4.0 to resolve the problem. If you are
unable to do so, use the information in the "Workaround" section.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Use any of the following methods to avoid the problem.
<P>
NOTE: You should try them in the order listed. The fourth method may
disable some or all authentication.
<P>
<P><h3>Upgrade Clients to Version 3.01 or Later</h3>
 
<P>
Make sure all clients are using Internet Explorer version 3.01 or later.
Install Service Pack 3 or higher for Windows NT 4.0 on the proxy server.
Install the Winsock Proxy client program on the client computers. In the
Internet Explorer Proxy settings (View, Options, Connection) enter the name
of the proxy server for all protocols except {Secure}. This will force the
browser to use the Winsock Proxy service instead of the Web Proxy service
when the user attempts to connect to an SSL (secure) page. All other
browser requests will use the Web Proxy service and still take advantage of
caching. This scenario will allow use of Windows NT Challenge for all
protocols because the Winsock Proxy has its own Windows NT Challenge
authentication built-in.
<P>
<P><h3>Enable Basic Authentication</h3>
 
<P>
Disable Windows NT Challenge/Response and enable Basic Authentication
instead. These settings can be found in the WWW service properties.
<P>
<P><h3>Install Winsock Proxy Client</h3>
 
<P>
Install the Winsock Proxy Client and disable the Proxy connection settings
on the Internet Explorer Clients. All clients will use the Winsock Proxy
service only.
<P>
Important: The following two methods will disable some or all of the
authentication on the proxy.
<P>
<P><h3>Disable Access Control</h3>
 
<P>
Disable Access Control for the Web proxy service. Doing this will allow all
users anonymous access to the web proxy service. They will no longer be
prompted for authentication when using the Web proxy service. The Web proxy
log file will no longer show usernames; they will be replaced with
anonymous.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Internet Explorer
versions 2.0, 2.01, 2.1, 3.0, 3.01, and 3.02. This problem is fixed in
Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.0. A supported fix is available only
for version 3.02.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-
tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific
problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains
this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
