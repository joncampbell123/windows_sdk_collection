The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Source Profiler, version 1.3, which is included with
   Visual C++ for Windows, version 1.0
<LI>Microsoft Source Profiler, version 1.30.200, which is included with
   Visual C++ for Windows, version 1.5
</UL> 
<P>
The information in this article is included in the documentation starting
with Visual C++ 5.0. Look there for future revisions.
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The "Source Profiler User's Guide" documentation states that CVWIN.DLL,
VTD.386, and WINDEBUG.386 are required to run the Microsoft Source Profiler
with Microsoft Windows. This is incorrect. Profiler just requires
CLONEDBG.DLL to operate under Windows.
<P>
Microsoft Source Profiler, versions 1.2 and earlier, require VTD.386,
CVWIN.DLL, and WINDEBUG.386 to operate under Windows. These are now
obsolete; all these functionalities are now implemented with CLONEDBG.DLL.
<P>
Do not make any modifications specified under the section "Modifying Your
Windows Configuration" in Chapter 1, "Installing the Microsoft Source
Profiler" of the "Source Profiler User's Guide," which is part of the
"Professional Tool User's Guide" shipped with Microsoft Visual C++ product.
However, make sure that CLONEDBG.DLL is available in your path (preferably
in your main Windows directory).
<P>
This to be a problem in the documentation provided with Visual C++ for
Windows, versions 1.0 and 1.5.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The engine that implements the WinDebug() API, which was needed by both
CodeView and Profiler, used to be implemented in CVWIN.DLL. This DLL
required the presence of WINDEBUG.386. The Profiler also required the
presence of VTD.386 to get accurate timings.
<P>
WinDebug() is now implemented in CLONEDBG.DLL, and therefore both CVWIN.DLL
and WINDEBUG.386 are obsolete. Additionally, Windows 3.1 has a default
virtual timer device built in, so VTD.386 is obsolete.
