<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Communal data declarations generate no PUBLIC definitions. Therefore,
although they can be placed in a library, they are not placed in the
library dictionary and will not be a part of the library listing
generated by the LIB utility.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Communal variables are supported only by QuickC, Microsoft C versions
5.0 and later, and MASM. They are, however, similar to common blocks
in FORTRAN. In C, communal variables are the uninitialized global data
items. In MASM, they are data items declared with the COMM qualifier.
<P>
The linker will assume the communal variables refer to an external
defining declaration elsewhere. If there is no external definition,
the linker allocates storage and initializes it to 0 (zero). If there
is more than one declaration, storage is allocated for the largest
data item declared. For example, if I is declared int I; in one module
and char I; in another module, the linker will allocate 2 bytes for I
because the int is 2 bytes but the char is only 1 byte. Because memory
for communal variables may not be assigned until load time, their use
may reduce the size of your executable file.
<P>
When a communal variable is declared in a library and defined in one
of the object modules, references to that variable will be resolved
with the defined variable. For this reason, communal variable
declarations are not recommended for any file that might be placed in
a library. If a variable defined in a .OBJ file accidentally had the
same name as a communal variable in a library that it is being linked
with, its value would unexplainably change every time you called a
library function that used that communal variable! The linker does not
issue a warning because the variable was defined only once, in the OBJ
file.
<P>
In addition, a communal data item X in a library cannot be used to
resolve an external reference to X in a module linked with that
library. For example, linking the following:
<P>
<PRE>   C File            Module in Library
   ------            -----------------

      extern int X;           int X;

      void main(void)
      {
         X = 5;
      }

</PRE>would still result in the error:
<P>
<PRE>   L2029 'X': unresolved external
