The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft QuickHelp for MS-DOS, versions 1.7 and 1.83
<LI>Microsoft QuickHelp for OS/2, versions 1.6, 1.7, and 1.83
</UL>

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using QuickHelp (QH.EXE) with certain help files, a problem
(described below) may occur if there is exactly one blank line below
the text displayed by QuickHelp. In this situation, the help lines can
be shifted down one line (by positioning the mouse on the elevator box
and clicking the left mouse button), which results in the problem.
<P>
The problem that occurs when the lines are shifted down depends upon
whether you are running QuickHelp under DOS or OS/2. Under DOS, the
screen will go blank. Scrolling up at this point puts garbage on the
screen.
<P>
Under OS/2, the list of topics will shift down one row leaving a blank
line at the top of the screen. The topics brought up by selecting any
line will be the topic listed on the next line down. If you then
select the blank line with the mouse or move off the blank line and
back onto it with the cursor, you will get a protection violation.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in QuickHelp. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The OS2.HLP help file that shipped with Presentation Manager Toolkit
for OS/2 version 1.20 can be used to demonstrate this problem. Make
sure OS2.HLP can be accessed from QuickHelp and do the following:

<OL><P><LI>Before entering QuickHelp, enter a 50-line display mode.

<P><LI>Start QuickHelp.

<P><LI>Select Categories and choose OS/2 API.

<P><LI>Choose Function group.

<P><LI>At this point, the elevator for the scroll bar will appear at the
   bottom of the page. Position the cursor on the elevator, just above
   the down arrow of the scroll bar, and click the left mouse button.

<P><LI>The highlight will be at the top of the screen on a blank line.
   Press the UP ARROW key.
<P>
</OL>Depending on the operating system, one of the previously described
problems will occur.
<P>
Other situations where these problems may occur are in 25-line mode on
the "Region functions" screen or the "Window functions." These screens
can be reached by selecting Categories, choosing OS/2 API, and then
sequencing through the screens with the N key until reaching the
appropriate screen.
