<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Debug a program that does EGA, VGA, or SVGA graphics. When you continue
from a breakpoint after the program has painted the screen, the screen
appears differently than before the breakpoint; all colors seemingly have
been turned to black. The program is using the EGA in 640x350, 16-color
mode.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This behavior is partly related to the size of the buffer that
CodeView creates for storing screen information. If you are running on
a CGA, EGA, or VGA board, this buffer is 16K by default. If you are
running on a monochrome board, this buffer is 4K by default. As you
are finding, 16K is not enough memory for a color image using 640x350
resolution (the maximum resolution supported is 640x200), hence the
loss of color after the breakpoint.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The best way to work around this limitation is to use a dual-monitor
setup for debugging applications that run in a high resolution
graphics mode. Invoke CodeView with the /2 switch and the CodeView
display will appear on the secondary monitor while the program's
graphical output will remain on the main monitor. Because the output
is going to a different screen, CodeView won't have to worry about
changing the video modes or the buffering.
