The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, versions 1.0 and 1.1
<LI>Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, versions 1.0 and 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Source Browser feature of the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB)
versions 1.0 and 1.1 is enabled or disabled depending upon the
existence of a database file (.BSC file) AND a program list (.MAK
file). The existence of a .BSC database file alone does not guarantee
that the Browse menu will be enabled for all modules in a project,
even if the .BSC file was built from .SBR files for every module. The
setting of a program list is also required.
<P>
Thus, if a .BSC file is built outside the PWB environment with
PWBRMAKE, then upon entering the PWB environment, the Browser will be
enabled for only one module at most (see below). To enable the Browse
menu for ALL modules, choose Set Program List from the Make menu, then
type the base name of the .BSC file (with .MAK or no extension) when
you are prompted for the filename. If the .MAK file you enter does not
exist, the dialog box appears for adding files to the program list.
Select Save List without actually adding any files. The Browse menu
will now be enabled for all files you open in the PWB editor.
<P>
PWB 2.0 can open a custom browser database. In fact, it can open any
browser database independently of a project file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The existence of a Source Browser database file means that the Browse
menu will be enabled for a source file with a base name that matches
the .BSC file.
<P>
For example, assume a project consists of several modules, with the
main source module named PROJECT.C. In addition, assume a Browser
database file named PROJECT.BSC is built from the .SBR Browser
information files produced by the compiler for every module in this
project. If the file PROJECT.C is opened in the PWB editor, the Browse
menu will be enabled because the base name (PROJECT) is the same as
the base name of the database file PROJECT.BSC.
<P>
On the other hand, if any of the other source files in the project is
opened in the PWB editor, the Browse menu will be disabled because the
base name of the file does not match the base name of the database
file. Also, if PROJECT.C is made the current file (which enables the
Browse menu) and a command is chosen from the Browse menu, such as
Goto Reference (which causes a jump to a different module), the Browse
menu will be disabled. In this case, the only way to reenable the
Browse menu is to make PROJECT.C the current file again.
<P>
To enable the Browse menu for all modules, set a program list to a
file with the .MAK extension and the same base name as the .BSC file.
Thus, in the example above, setting the program list to PROJECT.MAK
will enable the Browse menu for all modules. In fact, this connection
between the .BSC file and the .MAK file enables the Browse menu for
the modules in the current project and for ANY file opened in the PWB
editor.
<P>
Therefore, if you open a file in the editor that is completely
unrelated to the current project (and may not even have a related .BSC
file), you can still use the Browse menu options. However, in this
situation, the information available from the Browser still pertains
to the original project only.
<P>
In summary, the .MAK file and .BSC file relationship is based solely
on the files' existence, NOT on the files' contents. The program list
does NOT need to contain the names of the modules in the current
project (or even be an actual makefile) in order for the Browser to
function.
