</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) version 2.0 that comes with Microsoft
C/C++ version 7.0 will attempt to use extended memory if it is
available (extended memory in the context of this article is meant to
include both XMS [extended] and EMS [expanded] memory). Although it is
not required, the availability of extended memory increases the speed
at which PWB can operate.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
PWB attempts to utilize extended memory in three ways:

<UL><LI>Virtual memory (VM)--PWB puts data such as build information and
   file data in virtual memory. VM can be accessed only from
   conventional memory (near or far memory below 640K). If a VM
   request is made and there is no available conventional memory, then
   any unused VM is swapped to an extended memory cache. When the
   extended memory cache is filled up, or if there is no extended
   memory, then the cache is moved to the disk.

<LI>The VM files are deleted when PWB is exited in normal fashion. If
   the system hangs or if a situation arises such that PWB cannot be
   exited correctly, you may see files on your disk that follow this
   naming convention: PWB*.VMM. Deleting these files while not in a
   PWB session will not corrupt the system. Do not delete these files
   during a PWB session, however, because PWB may be using them.

<LI>When PWB spawns another program (the compiler, linker, CodeView, or
   the application being developed), PWB attempts to save an image of
   itself in extended memory. Again, if there is not enough extended
   memory, or there is no extended memory, PWB saves the image to disk.

<LI>PWB was built with MOVE (Microsoft Overlaid Virtual Environment),
   technology which utilizes extended memory as a cache for its
   overlays. If there is not enough extended memory, or there is no
   extended memory, overlays are read from disk.
<P>
   Extended memory increases the operating speed of PWB, but it does
   not improve functionality. For example, extended memory does not
   allow more extensions to be loaded. The best way to ensure smooth
   operation of PWB is to increase the amount of available
   conventional memory.
