<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Unlike some overlay systems, the Microsoft Overlay Virtual Environment
(MOVE) does not replace the Interrupt 3Fh (INT 3Fh) overlay call in the
code with a direct call (CALL instruction). This technique can be very
expensive in terms of execution time if a program has a time-critical loop
that continually calls a function in an overlay that is already loaded into
memory. The call to the function in the overlay must go through the
Interrupt 3Fh handler even though the code is already present in memory.
<P>
To optimize a program for speed, it is recommended that functions be
grouped so that functions that are called regularly are either not placed
in overlays or are placed in the overlays from which they are called.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft deliberately chose not to perform the overlay call fix-ups. There
is overhead involved with implementing the fix-up technique. In many
situations, the overhead is more costly in terms of execution speed than
performing the overlay swap each time.
<P>
The technique of changing the Interrupt 3Fh calls to direct calls works
efficiently as long as an overlay is not being continually added and
removed from memory. When the overlay gets removed from memory, the overlay
manager must fix-up all references to any functions in the overlay. This
requires "walking" the stack and making the necessary fix-ups, as well as
changing the code back to the original Interrupt 3Fh call. Microsoft found
that with many overlays (larger programs), this was less efficient.
<P>
For more information about grouping functions into MOVE overlays, refer to
"functions" and "segments" in the online help and to Chapter 16 of the
"Microsoft C/C++ Programming Techniques" manual supplied with Microsoft
C/C++ 7.0.
