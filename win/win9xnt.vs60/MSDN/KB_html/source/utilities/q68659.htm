MS-DOS
kbtool kberrmsg
<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, version 5.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When LINK is run under a Novell network, LINK may fail with the following
error:
<P>
<PRE>   L1085: cannot open temporary file

</PRE>In addition, the C version 6.0 Setup program (SETUP.EXE), the Programmer's
WorkBench (PWB) for MS-DOS versions 1.0 and 1.1, and real-mode CodeView
(CV.EXE) versions 3.0, 3.1, and 3.11 may all hang when run under some
Novell NetWare software.
<P>
These problems are directly related to the network software, but may
be corrected with a set of patch files available from Microsoft as an
application note titled "Network Patches for Utilities" (SC0381).
Application notes can be obtained by calling Microsoft Product Support
Services.
<P>
This file has been removed from the Software Library but can be
requested by calling Microsoft Product Support Services.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following is the complete text of the application note, which
includes the details of the problems mentioned above:
<P>
 
<PRE>                    Network Patches for Utilities
</PRE> 
<P>
The enclosed Network Patches for Microsoft Utilities disk contains the
following five files:
<P>
<PRE>   README.DOC
   CVPATCH.EXE
   PWBPATCH.EXE
   SETUPFIX.EXE
   LINK.EXE

</PRE>These files solve conflicts with certain network setups. Please be
sure to make backup copies of the original files.
<P>
<P><h3>Network Patch Files</h3>
 
<P>
When run under certain network software, some Microsoft utilities may
hang. The enclosed patch files are designed to correct these problems
for CodeView versions 3.00, 3.10, and 3.11; the Programmer's WorkBench
(PWB) versions 1.00 and 1.10; and the C 6.00 Setup program.
<P>
To install the patches, first copy the patch files (PWBPATCH.EXE,
CVPATCH.EXE, and SETUPFIX.EXE) to the directories where you have
installed PWB, CodeView, and Setup, respectively. Each patch assumes
that the utility file it is to patch is in the same directory.
<P>
Run SETUPFIX.EXE to patch SETUP.EXE. The original file will be saved
as SETUP.BAK. Run CVPATCH.EXE to patch CV.EXE. The original file will
be saved as CV.BAK. Run PWBPATCH.EXE to patch PWBED.EXE. The original
file will be saved as PWBED.BAK. The patched utilities should run free
of network interference.
<P>
<P><h3>Microsoft LINK Version 5.13</h3>
 
<P>
LINK version 5.13 includes code to work around another problem that
sometimes occurs when running on a network. On large projects, the
linker needs to open some temporary files to work around DOS memory
limitations. LINK version 5.10 (supplied with C 6.00) will sometimes
fail in its attempts to open a temporary file when run under certain
network software.
<P>
The problem actually lies in the network software, not the linker.
When the network is loaded, the return value from an open call
sometimes gets corrupted. When the call fails, it is because an "Out
of handles" error (EMFILE) is returned as a "No such file or
directory" error (ENOENT). If this occurs, LINK 5.10 halts with an
"L1085: cannot open temporary file" error.
<P>
LINK 5.13 includes a change to correct for the above situation (even
though the problem is in the network software). When LINK version 5.13
receives an ENOENT error on a failed open call, it will still try to
free some file handles and reopen the temporary file, regardless of
the error returned.
<P>
To make the correction, locate LINK version 5.10 and replace it with
LINK version 5.13 from the enclosed disk. Again, be sure to save a
backup copy of the original file (LINK 5.10).
