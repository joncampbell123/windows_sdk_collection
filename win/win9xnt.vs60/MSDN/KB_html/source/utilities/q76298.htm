<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In NMAKE, a command line that changes the operating system PATH
command does not affect the other commands that NMAKE processes. This
is part of the design behavior of NMAKE. To change the PATH
environment variable, use the SET command.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The NMAKE documentation provided with Microsoft C version 6.0 and
Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0 state that NMAKE supports
any command that you can run at the MS-DOS command prompt. This
statement is not entirely true. NMAKE does not emulate the PATH
command and ignores it.
<P>
There are two methods to modify the PATH environment variable in
NMAKE. You can create a PATH macro to contain the path to assign to
the PATH system variable. The macro name "PATH" must be in uppercase
letters. Alternately, you can use the SET command. For example, you
could place the following line into a description block: "SET
PATH=c:\;c:\dos" (without quotation marks).
<P>
The following sample makefiles demonstrate these concepts. In the
first makefile, the PATH command has no effect. The second and third
makefiles demonstrate two methods to modify the PATH, effectively
emulating the PATH command entered at the MS-DOS or OS/2 prompt.
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Makefile #1</h3>
 
<P>
# The PATH command has no effect on the contents of the PATH
# environment variable.
<P>
all:
<PRE>   path c:\c700\bin;
   cl /c sample.c

</PRE><h3>Sample Makefile #2</h3>
 
<P>
# The SET command in this makefile temporarily modifies the PATH
# system variable for commands that are processed for the duration
# of the makefile.
<P>
all:
<PRE>   set path=c:\c700\bin;
   cl /c sample.c

</PRE><h3>Sample Makefile #3</h3>
 
<P>
# The macro called PATH modifies the PATH system variable for the
# duration of the makefile.
<P>
PATH=c:\c700\bin;
<P>
all:
<PRE>   cl /c sample.c
