The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, versions 3.x, 4.0x, 4.1, 5.0x, 5.1x,
   5.2, 5.3x, 5.50, and 5.60
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In the MS-DOS operating system, an executable file can be as large as
1 MB; an executable file that contains overlays can be as large as 16
MB. Microsoft LINK can create overlays by dividing the application
into a resident portion that is loaded when the application begins
execution and overlays that are loaded into memory as needed. This
method produces one .EXE file. This method reduces the memory required
to run the program but increases the time required for overhead
processing. The application also requires more disk space because it
must contain code for the overlay manager.
<P>
For far calls from the resident portion to an overlay or between
overlays, LINK substitutes the following sequence of code:
<P>
<PRE>   int     IntNo         ; IntNo specified with /O, default is 3Fh
   DB      OverlayNum    ; The overlay number
   DW      OverlayEntry  ; Offset of the entry point

</PRE>The Interrupt instruction passes control to the static overlay manager
which determines which overlay is called and if it is already loaded
in memory. If the overlay is not in memory, the manager loads the
overlay from the executable file.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To create an overlay using the Static Overlay Manager, surround the names
of object modules with parentheses. LINK assigns individual segments to an
overlay, not object modules. For example, consider the following LINK
command line:
<P>
<PRE>   link main.obj (mod1.obj mod2.obj) (mod3.obj);

</PRE>The resident portion consists of the segments declared in MAIN.OBJ and
any segments that do not have the class 'CODE' in MOD1.OBJ, MOD2.OBJ,
and MOD3.OBJ. LINK assigns only segments of class 'CODE' to an
overlay. The overlay to which a code segment is assigned is determined
by the object module that first defines a segment. For example, of
both MAIN.OBJ and MOD1.OBJ define a segment called "ASEG," the data in
ASEG defined in MOD1.OBJ becomes part of the resident portion of the
application because ASEG was first defined in MAIN.OBJ.
<P>
LINK adds three segments to an overlaid program: OVERLAY_AREA,
OVERLAY_DATA, and OVERLAY_END. The overlay manager loads each overlay
into OVERLAY_DATA when it is needed. OVERLAY_END immediately follows
OVERLAY_AREA to facilitate determining the size of the overlay area
(subtract the segment address of OVERLAY_AREA from OVERLAY_END). LINK
initializes the OVERLAY_DATA segment with information the overlay
manager needs. OVERLAY_DATA is part of DGROUP.
<P>
The overlay manager code is stored in the OVLM6L module in the
Microsoft language run-time libraries. LINK places this code into the
_TEXT segment.
<P>
Each overlay in the executable file has an executable file header. The
structure of the file created by the command line example above is as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>        ----------------------
       |     .EXE header      |       Overlay 0h
        ----------------------
       |                      |
       |   Resident portion   |
       |         and          |
       |   overlay segments   |
       |                      |
        ----------------------
       |     .EXE header      |       Overlay 1h
        ----------------------
       |                      |
       |     Code segments    |
       |                      |
        ----------------------
       |     .EXE header      |       Overlay 2h
        ----------------------
       |                      |
       |     Code segments    |
       |                      |
        ----------------------

</PRE>At run time, the resident portion of the application initializes the
overlay interrupt vector specified by the linker (by default,
Interrupt 3Fh) with the address of the overlay manager. When the
interrupt occurs, control transfers to the overlay manager. When the
overlay manager loads an overlay, it retrieves the file name from
OVERLAY_DATA, locates the overlay using information in the overlay's
.EXE header, reads the contents of the overlay into OVERLAY_AREA, and
transfers control to the overlay.
<P>
The memory image of an executable file that contains overlays is as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>        ----------------------+-&gt; high memory address
       |                      |
       |     ROOT (data)      |
       |                      |
        ----------------------+-&gt; OVERLAY_END
       |                      |
       | OVERLAY AREA (code)  |
       |                      |
        ----------------------+-&gt; OVERLAY_AREA
       |                      |
       |     ROOT (code)      |
       |                      |
        ----------------------+-&gt; low memory address

</PRE>Note:

<UL><LI>The names of segments in an overlay must differ from the names of
   segments in the resident portion. To accomplish this with a
   Microsoft language product, compile the application for the medium,
   large, or huge memory model.

<LI>LINK /INCR[EMENTAL] does not support overlays.

<LI>The MS-DOS portion of a bound executable file cannot contain
   overlays.

<LI>Do not change the name of an executable file that contains overlays
   if it will run with MS-DOS versions prior to version 3.0.
<P>
</UL>The information in this article applies only to static overlays. For more
information, refer to chapter 15 in the Microsoft C/C++ "Environment and
Tools" manual for version 7.0. For information on the Microsoft Overlaid
Virtual Environment (MOVE) that provides dynamic overlays, refer to the
MOVEAPI.TXT file provided with C/C++ version 7.0.
<P>
For Visual C++, refer to either the Comprehensive Index or Books Online for
detailed information about overlaid programs using either the Static
Overlay Manager or MOVE.
