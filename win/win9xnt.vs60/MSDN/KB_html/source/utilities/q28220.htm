The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft LINK Utility for MS-DOS, versions 5.0x, 5.1x, 5.3,
   5.31.009, and 5.6
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The LINK error "fatal error L1085: cannot open temporary file" is received
when linking a program consisting of many object modules. When rebooting
and making more room in RAM, the error does not occur.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The linker error has nothing to do with available RAM. The fact that the
linker worked when the machine is rebooted can be due to any one of several
areas of concern:

<UL><LI>The removal of resident software upon rebooting may have removed some
   interference. Microsoft does not guarantee that its products will work
   correctly with TSR (terminate-and-stay-resident) software. A TSR can
   interfere with the finding of the TMP environment variable, so the
   temporary file will not be created.

<LI>Insufficient file handles can cause this error. The CONFIG.SYS file
   should have the setting, files=20. Some of the handles may have been
   freed upon rebooting without the TSRs. If the disk is full, leaving no
   room for a temporary file to be created, this error will occur.

<LI>This error can also occur if the TMP environment variable is not set up
   correctly or is pointing to a directory that is full.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the Microsoft LINK
Utility for MS-DOS, versions 5.0x, 5.1x, 5.3, 5.31.009, and 5.6. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
