<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When NMAKE defines a macro in a makefile, it does not define a
corresponding environment variable for the processes NMAKE invokes.
However, if an environment variable of the same name already exists,
NMAKE reassigns it to have the same value as the macro.
<P>
For example, the first sample makefile below defines a CL macro. If an
environment variable named CL exists, the CL macro in the makefile
temporarily reassigns the CL environment variable such that the
compiler only compiles files and does not link them. If the CL
environment variable does not already exist, the CL macro is not added
to the environment and does not change the compiler settings.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To create an environment variable in a makefile, use the SET command.
The second sample makefile below demonstrates creating the CL
environment variable if it does not already exist in the inherited
environment.
<P>
The reassignment of existing environment variables can lead to
unexpected errors. In the third sample program, if the environment
variable 'LINK' is defined, one of the following errors will be
generated:
<P>
<PRE>   LINK : error LNK1104: cannot open file "link.obj" (32 bit)

 -or-

   LINK : fatal error L1093: link.obj : object file not found (16 bit)

</PRE>NTWIN32.MAK, the Win32 application master NMAKE definitions file for
the Microsoft Win32 SDK for Windows NT programming samples, contains
the macro definition "link=link". Any makefile which has
"!include &lt;NTWIN32.MAK&gt;" will fail with LNK1104, if the environment
variable 'LINK' is defined.
<P>
The following warnings for the 32 bit compiler are generated for
makefiles which define the MACRO 'cl' if the environment variable 'CL'
was also defined:
<P>
<PRE>   Command line warning D4024 : unrecognized source file type 'cl',
        object file assumed
   Command line warning D4027 : source file 'cl' ignored

</PRE>NOTE: If you use NMK.COM instead of NMAKE, you must use the SET
command to reassign any environment variables. NMK.COM does not permit
you to use macro assignments to override the environment. For more
information, query in the Microsoft Knowledge Base on the following
words:
<P>
<PRE>   NMK.COM and environment and macros

</PRE><h3>Sample Makefile #1</h3>
 
<P>
# If the CL environment variable does not exist, this makefile
# compiles and links TEST.C. If the CL environment variable exists,
# the makefile changes its value to "/c" and prevents the linker from
# running.
<P>
CL=/c
<P>
ALL:
<PRE>   cl test.c

</PRE><h3>Sample Makefile #2</h3>
 
<P>
# This is a modified makefile from sample 1. Because CL is set with
# the SET command, the linker does not run.
<P>
INCLUDE=d:\include
ALL:
<PRE>   set cl=/c
   cl test.c

</PRE><h3>Sample Makefile #3</h3>
 
<P>
# If the LINK environment variable does not exist, this makefile
# compiles and links TEST.C. If the LINK environment variable exists,
# the makefile changes its value to "link" and the linker error:
# LNK1104 or L1093 will be generated.
<P>
link=link
<P>
ALL:
<PRE>   cl /c test.c
   $(link) test.obj
