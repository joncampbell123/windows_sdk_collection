<UL><LI>Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, versions 5.0x, 5.1x, 5.2, 5.3x, 5.5,

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The header of an executable file created by Microsoft LINK contains two
different checksum values. The first, located at offset 12-13h in the old
.EXE header, is the complemented checksum of all words in the file. The
second, located at offset 08-0Bh in the new .EXE header, is the 32-bit
checksum of all DWORD values in the file. The text below describes the
process involved to calculate these checksum values.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following information that describes calculating the first checksum is
from page 122 or the "MS-DOS Encyclopedia" (Microsoft Press):
<P>
<PRE>   12-13H (Complemented Checksum) This word contains the one's
   complement of the summation of all words in the .EXE file. Current
   versions of MS-DOS basically ignore this word when they load a .EXE
   program; however, future versions might not. When LINK generates a
   .EXE file, it adds together all the contents of the .EXE file
   (including the .EXE header) by treating the entire file as a long
   sequence of 16-bit words. During this addition, LINK gives the
   Complemented Checksum word (12-13H) a temporary value of 0000H. If
   the file consists of an odd number of bytes, then the final byte is
   treated as a word with a high byte of 00H. Once LINK has totaled
   all words in the .EXE file, it performs a one's complement
   operation on the total and records the answer in the .EXE file
   header at offsets 12-13H. The validity of a .EXE file can then be
   checked by performing the same word-totaling process as LINK
   performed. The total should be FFFFH, because the total will
   include LINK's calculated complemented checksum, which is designed
   to give the file the FFFFH total.

</PRE>The sample code below shows one implementation of this technique.
<P>
Note that Microsoft LINK does not correctly calculate the checksum if the
linker command line includes the /CODEVIEW or /EXEPACK option switches.
However, because the MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, and OS/2 versions 1.x do
not verify the checksum, this behavior does not present a problem under
normal circumstances. Microsoft LINK version 5.3 and later do not compute a
16-bit or 32-bit checksum. The reserved bytes in the .EXE header are set to
zero.
<P>
The system uses the old .EXE header checksum when an MS-DOS application
runs. However, for any other type of executable file, (an application or
dynamic-link library [DLL] for Windows or OS/2 versions 1.x, or a bound
application), LINK computes a 32-bit checksum for the new .EXE header. This
calculation is only slightly more complicated than that discussed earlier.
<P>
First of all, the checksum is not the sum of every DWORD value in the
physical file. It is the sum of the DWORD values in the executable portion
of the file. As other items, like resources, symbolic information, and so
on, are added to the .EXE file, the checksum value does not change. To
determine the size of the executable file, look at the two words at offset
02h and 04h in the old .EXE file header.
<P>
Second, the 32-bit checksum is the sum of each DWORD value in the
executable file EXCEPT for the checksum itself. Because Microsoft LINK does
not perform a complement operation, the result is NOT FFFFFFFFh when all
DWORD values are summed.
<P>
The following code example demonstrates calculating these checksum values.
