The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, version 1.1
<LI>Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, version 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The current editor settings in the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) may be
changed by choosing Editor Settings from the Options menu, making a
change to the &lt;assign&gt; pseudofile, and then saving that file. If
SHIFT+F8 (initialize) is pressed while the &lt;assign&gt; pseudofile is
still displayed, PWB may appear as though it is hung; it is actually
reinitializing each statement of the editor settings (&lt;assign&gt;)
pseudofile.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following steps will reproduce this behavior:

<OL><P><LI>Enter PWB and select the Options menu.

<P><LI>Choose the Editor Settings menu.

<P><LI>Make a change in the &lt;assign&gt; pseudofile and then save it.

<P><LI>Press the "initialize" keystroke combination (SHIFT+F8) and a popup
   box will appear stating "reinitializing...". The reinitialization
   is actually taking place but it is very slow because PWB is
   rebuilding the &lt;assign&gt; pseudofile for each entry in your TOOLS.INI
   file.
<P>
</OL>This behavior does not occur in PWB version 1.00. Version 1.10
includes a change to the earlier version; you can see a new assignment
(made via "arg textarg &lt;assign&gt;") immediately updated if you are
viewing the &lt;assign&gt; pseudofile.
<P>
This is expected behavior because the &lt;assign&gt; pseudofile is meant to
show the settings that were in effect at the time the file was
displayed. It is not recommended that it be dynamically updated except
via the mechanism of actually editing the file. If you changed a
setting via "arg textarg assign" (ALT+A textarg ALT+=), a better way
to view your new setting(s) is by using "refresh" (SHIFT+F7), or by
switching away and back again via "setfile" (F2).
