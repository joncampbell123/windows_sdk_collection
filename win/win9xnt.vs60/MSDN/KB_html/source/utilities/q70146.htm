<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
NMAKE does not support using a macro to substitute for more than one
command line in a makefile. An attempt to use a macro in this way
fails when NMAKE treats the macro expansion as one long concatenated
command line.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A makefile can contain many description blocks, each of which contain
the same sequence of commands. Therefore, it would be useful to use a
macro instead of the multiple commands shared between description
blocks.
<P>
For example, your makefile might somewhat resemble to sample makefile
below. The macro in that makefile is designed to expand to the
commands CLS (clear screen) and DIR (directory). However, when this
makefile runs, the DIR command does not run because the command line
passed to the system is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>   CLS &lt;cr/lf&gt; DIR

</PRE>where &lt;cr/lf&gt; denotes a carriage return and a line feed character.
<P>
One method that effectively avoids repeating many command sequences in
your makefile involved creating a batch file that contains the
commands. The makefile calls the batch file when these commands are
required. In addition, in OS/2, you can specify more than one command
on a line by separating the commands with an ampersand (&amp;) character.
<P>
Under Windows NT, you can execute multiple commands by separating them with
a &amp;&amp;.
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Makefile</h3>
 
<P>
# This makefile attempts to clear the screen and request a directory
# listing by expanding one macro. However, the DIR command is not
# executed.
<P>
CMDS = CLS ^
<PRE>       DIR

</PRE>showdir:
<PRE>   $(CMDS)

</PRE>In order to achieve this on Windows NT, use
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Makefile</h3>
 
<P>
#
# This works on Windows NT
#
<P>
CMDS = CLS &amp;&amp; DIR
<P>
showdir:
<PRE>   $(CMDS)
</PRE>
