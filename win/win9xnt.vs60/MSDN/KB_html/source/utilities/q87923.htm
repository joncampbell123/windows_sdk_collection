<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft CodeView for Windows, versions 4.0 and 4.01
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft CodeView for Windows versions 4.0 and 4.01 may not stop on a
breakpoint in a DLL. When setting the breakpoint, the breakpoint list (BL)
shows that this breakpoint is virtual. Even after the DLL is loaded, this
breakpoint is still listed as virtual.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs when you have more than one copy of the same DLL on
your disk. CodeView differentiates between these DLLs even if they are
exactly the same.
<P>
CodeView is allowing the user to load the symbolic information for one
copy, but Windows itself is loading the other copy. Because the symbolic
information is used to set breakpoints, breakpoints that are set on
symbolic information of a DLL that is not ever loaded by Windows will
always be virtual.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The best resolution for this problem is to remove all but one copy of the
DLL from the disk.
<P>
This problem was corrected in CodeView 4.1. When loading multiple
copies of symbolic information for the same DLL or .EXE, CodeView
4.1 generates the following warning:
<P>
<PRE>   CV2213 Warning: preloaded symbols may not match 'MyDLL.DLL'

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft CodeView versions
4.0 and 4.01. This problem was corrected in Microsoft CodeView version 4.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
CodeView will only stop on a breakpoint that is associated with an
address. Virtual breakpoints are breakpoints that are set on a section
of code that has not been loaded into memory yet. When the code is
loaded into memory, the breakpoint becomes a physical breakpoint, and
is associated with a memory address.
<P>
Virtual breakpoints are displayed with a "V" before the "D" or "E" for
disabled or enabled, respectively.
