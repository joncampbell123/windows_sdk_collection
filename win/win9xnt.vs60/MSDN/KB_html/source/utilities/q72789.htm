<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When creating a tiny model program (.COM file) with the Microsoft
Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) version 1.1, it is important to have
"Main Language" set to "C", instead of using "None", which is the
default. If Main Language is set to None, the following LINK error is
generated:
<P>
<PRE>   LINK: fatal error L1127: far segment references not allowed
                            with /TINY

</PRE>The error occurs because CRTCOM.LIB, which contains the C startup code
for .COM programs, does not get linked in when Main Language is set to
None. This results in segment references to both code and data that
are in two different segments. Since a .COM program must have both the
code and data in a single segment, the L1127 error is generated.
<P>
You can check the Main Language setting by selecting the Options menu
and choosing Build Options. In the Build Options dialog box you can
see your Main Language selection and you can also change it there, if
necessary. If you receive the L1127 error when trying to build a .COM
file inside PWB, make sure your Main Language is set to an appropriate
language and then rebuild your project.
