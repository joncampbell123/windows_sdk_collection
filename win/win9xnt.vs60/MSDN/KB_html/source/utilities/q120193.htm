The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>The Microsoft Library Manager (LIB.EXE), included with:
<P><PRE>    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.0 and 1.5
</UL></PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you build a Static Library (.LIB) from the Visual Workbench, the
following error message may be returned:
<P>
<PRE>   LIB Fatal Error U1150
   page size too small; use option /PAGE:n to increase it

</PRE>There is no way to modify the "LIB" command line within the Visual
Workbench.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There is a relatively simple workaround for this problem. All you need to
do is find the inference rule within the makefile generated by Visual
Workbench that causes the LIB utility to be run. There, you can change the
command line that is passed to the LIB utility. To do this, open the
makefile in a text editor and search for the $(PROJ).LIB: inference rule.
When that inference rule is evaluated, it creates a LIB response file
called "$(PROJ).CRF", which contains the command-line switches as well as
the responses for the LIB utility's prompts. The /PAGESIZE option is set to
64, and it can be found somewhere between the pair of "&lt;&lt;" symbols. All
that needs to be done is to change that default value from 64 to a power of
2 that is greater than 64 and is less  than or equal to 32768 (such as 128,
256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, and so forth).
<P>
NOTE: /PAGESIZE:64 is the hard-coded default used by the Visual Workbench
when building a static library.
<P>
There is one important caveat here, however: When you use the internal
build engine of the Visual Workbench, the inference rule portion of the
makefile is not used. Instead, the Visual Workbench uses the inference
rules only when the file is opened as an external makefile. For this
solution to work, the makefile must be opened as an external makefile in
the Visual Workbench or the library must be built with NMAKE from the
command line.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The page size of a library sets the alignment of modules stored in the
library. Modules start at locations that are a multiple of the page size
from the beginning of the file. When the page size is too small, the U1150
error occurs.
