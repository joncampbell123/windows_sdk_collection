<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft Professional Advisor Library version 1.0 includes a
sample program (MHTEST.EXE) that demonstrates basic use of the help
system API. However, this program example was written for OS/2 and
there is no MS-DOS example included in the package. The sample code
provided below demonstrates how to use the help system functions
under MS-DOS.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The MHTEST.EXE example is built from two source files, HTEST.C and
HELPBACK.C. HTEST.C is a sample front-end application that interfaces
with the library functions. HELPBACK.C is a sample set of call-back
functions, which the library functions require you to have in your
code. Both of these files are written for OS/2 (utilizing OS/2 API
calls) and will not compile and link explicitly for MS-DOS; however, the
program will run under either MS-DOS or OS/2 if it is compiled and linked
for OS/2 and then bound for MS-DOS.
<P>
If an unbound, MS-DOS-only version of the program is desired, the sample
code below illustrates how to write MS-DOS-specific versions of the seven
call-back functions needed by the library. The nature of these
call-back functions is best described in the following paragraph from
the article "Adding Hypertext-Based Help to Your Application Using the
Microsoft Help System" from the "Microsoft Systems Journal," May 1990:
<P>
<PRE>   If you are developing an MS-DOS application, you must provide some
   call-back functions. These call-back functions are involved with
   opening and closing files, reading data from a file, allocating and
   deallocating memory, and locking and unlocking memory. The help
   library imposes this burden upon the programmer because of the
   limited resources available under MS-DOS. If the help engine were to
   use the standard malloc or _dos_allocmem functions to obtain memory
   for itself, it would probably find itself running out of memory if
   it were embedded into a large program, or possibly conflicting with
   the program's own memory management scheme. For example, many
   large programs manage their memory using a virtual memory
   management scheme. By forcing the application to provide call-back
   functions to control memory allocation, the help engine never
   intrudes on the application's own memory management scheme.

</PRE>It is important to note that the sample routines provided below are
only simple templates for the type of functions needed; they do not
include any error checking or error-handling capabilities. The sample
routines are written for use with the large and compact memory models
and will require some minor modifications to avoid compiler warnings
under the small or medium models.
