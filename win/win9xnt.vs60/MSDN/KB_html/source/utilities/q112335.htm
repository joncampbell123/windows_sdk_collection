The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft CVPACK Utility for MS-DOS, versions 4.0, 4.1, and 4.26
<LI>Microsoft CVPACK Utility for Windows NT, version 4.25 and 4.27
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Building a debug version of an application containing more than 64K of
type index information may cause one or more of the following error
messages, depending on what version of CVPACK is being used:
<P>
<PRE>    CVPACK: fatal error CK1020: packed type index exceeds 65535 in module
        &lt;filename.obj&gt;

    CVPACK: warning CK4009: exceeded 64K types ... discarding subsequent
        types.

    cvpack.exe INTERNAL ERROR, exception code - 0xc0000005.


</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
These errors are due in part to the fact that CodeView's symbolic type
information index is a 16 bit value, which causes an overflow if the number
of packed symbol types exceeds 64K.
<P>
Note that CK4009 is a Visual C++ version 1.0 (32-bit) and version 1.5 (16-
bit) replacement for the older CK1020 error message. With CK1020, the
packer failed and the program could not be debugged. With CK4009, the
packer does not fail, but discards all subsequent nonprimitive types. This
will at least allow the program to be debugged for those symbols whose
types have not been discarded.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Here are a few things that can be done to reduce the number of symbols in
an application so that it can be successfully debugged:

<OL><P><LI>Compile only the source files that you need to debug with /Zi and use
   /Zd for the rest. This will reduce the number of symbols in your
   application. (If you are using Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) or the
   Visual Workbench, it will also require you to use an external makefile,
   because compilation is not module selective within these tools.) If you
   choose to compile with /Zd, you will get line number support only for
   the modules. With a linker mapfile you can determine the location of
   your public symbols so you can at least view your global data in
   CodeView if needed. For additional information, please see the following
   article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
   ARTICLE-ID: <B><A href="../utilities/q48241.htm">Q48241</A></B>
   TITLE: Relationship between Map File Addresses and Location in Memory

<P><LI>If you are using MFC with Visual C++, try rebuilding the MFC libraries
   with the /Zi switch instead of /Z7. This will build a .PDB (Program
   Database) file for the entire library that will contain all of the
   symbolic type information. While compiling the source files, each time
   the compiler generates type information for a new symbol, it checks the
   PDB file to see if this type is already present. If so, the type is not
   added. Using this process, the total amount of type information is
   reduced by eliminating redundant types that would otherwise be present
   in the .OBJ files created for the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC)
   libraries using /Z7. Using /Zi causes redundancies to be reduced before
   the packer code executes, which helps the packer operate more
   efficiently.

<P><LI>For Visual C++ projects, compile using /Fd to specify a single .PDB file
   for your application. Again, the idea here is to reduce the number of
   types by eliminating redundancies that are present in multi module
   applications before the packer executes. Note that this is automatic if
   you are building from the Visual Workbench. The default file will be
   named MSVC.PDB: using /Fd allows you to specify an alternative name.
   Since the default is to use PDB files (which eliminates redundant
   information), the problem is much less likely to occur. To enable use of
   the PDB, use /Zi not /Z7 when compiling, and don't turn off "Program
   Database" in the IDE (or use /PDB:NONE on the command line).

<P><LI>If possible, consider eliminating some of the more complex types such as
   classes, structures, enums, and unions. This will reduce the likelihood
   of the types being redundantly included in your application.

<P><LI>Compile some of the modules without any debugging information at all. If
   using the Microsoft Foundation Classes, care must be taken not to mix
   modules compiled with _DEBUG and modules compiled without _DEBUG. Try
   building the MFC library with CODEVIEW=0 or CODEVIEW=2 to reduce the
   amount of symbolic information (the default for DEBUG is "=1", which
   defines _DEBUG). When the class library is built with CODEVIEW = 0, you
   will not have any library debugging information available. The MFC
   debugging functions TRACE and ASSERT will still be available, however.
   With CODEVIEW=2, some components of the library will be built with
   debugging information. The README.TXT in ..\MFC\SRC explains further
   what each of the options do in terms of limiting the debugging
   information available for the MFC library. Additional information can
   also be found in the Appendix of the "Class Libraries User's Guide" as
   follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>     Appendix B for Visual C++ version 1.0  (16-bit)
     Appendix A for Visual C++ version 1.5  (16-bit)
     Appendix B for Visual C++ version 1.1  (32-bit)
</PRE>
<P><LI>One other unconfirmed possible solution is related to precompiled
   headers. You might try enabling or disabling the use of precompiled
   headers, whichever is not currently being used, and then rebuild
   everything. This may have varying effects depending on your
   application's use of header files.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in CVPACK utility for MS-DOS,
versions 4.0, 4.1, and 4.26, and CVPACK Utility for Windows NT, version
4.25. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Symbol and Type OMF Specification requires that symbolic debugging
information be contained in two tables emitted by the compiler (in Visual
C++ these are included in the object modules and the .PDB file). The first
table is called $$SYMBOLS and describes the symbols in the object file;
while the second is called $$TYPES and contains information about the
symbol types. For example, the statement "int i;" defines the symbol "i" of
type "int". There are fields in the records of both tables that are used to
index into the records of the other table. Furthermore, there is a third
table of symbolic information that is generated by the linker and written
into the executable file. This table is called PUBLICS and contains the
symbol records for each public symbol encountered while processing the
object files.
<P>
CVPACK's purpose is to remove duplicate symbol and type information and
rewrite the remaining information in a format optimized for CodeView
processing. The type indices for this remaining information must not exceed
64K, because the index itself is a 16-bit value. Because this index is part
of the specification, it cannot be changed without breaking the tools that
depend on it, many of which are supplied by third-party vendors.
