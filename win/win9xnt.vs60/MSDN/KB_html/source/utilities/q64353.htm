<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
As documented on page 79 of the "Microsoft C Reference" shipped with C
version 6.0 and in the online help, the "deflang" switch in the
Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) sets the default filename extension for
list boxes in PWB dialog boxes. Another (undocumented) feature of this
switch is to enable you to be prompted to "Set Program List?" when
loading a source file with a .MAK file associated with it in the
current directory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
By default, "deflang" is not set. You can set the deflang switch in
the [PWB] tagged section of the TOOLS.INI file, for example:
<P>
<PRE>   deflang:C

</PRE>This changes the default filename extension in PWB's dialog boxes
(such as Open in the File menu) from "*.*" to "*.c", so that only
files with the .c extension show up by default. Other languages can be
specified as well, as shown below:
<P>
<PRE>   Switch Setting     Extension
   --------------     ---------

   no value            .*
   C                   .c
   Asm                 .asm
   BASIC               .bas
   FORTRAN             .for
   Pascal              .pas
   COBOL               .cbl
   LISP                .lsp

</PRE>Note that the online documentation specifies "Assembler" as the switch
to use for .ASM files, but this is incorrect. "Asm" is the correct
switch to use to make Assembler the default language.
<P>
The deflang switch also enables you to be prompted as to whether or
not the program list should be set automatically. If you load a file
that has the extension specified by the "deflang" switch and you also
have a .MAK file with the same base filename in the same directory,
PWB will prompt you about loading the program list.
<P>
For example, assume that deflang is set to C, and TEST.MAK and TEST.C
are in the same directory. If you type PWB TEST.C at the
command-prompt, PWB will pause when loading and prompt with "Set
Program List? TEST.MAK". At this point you can specify yes or no.
<P>
When already in PWB, if you choose Open from the File menu, and select
TEST.C as the file to open, PWB will also prompt you at this point
regarding whether or not you want TEST.MAK loaded as the program list,
but only if NO program list is currently set.
<P>
Note that beginning with PWB version 1.1, command-line switches are
provided that allow the automatic loading of a program list.
