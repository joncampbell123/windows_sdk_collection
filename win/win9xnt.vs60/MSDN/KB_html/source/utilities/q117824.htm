<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.5
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
While building a project, the following error message appears:
<P>
<PRE>   RC: fatal error RW1021: I/O error reading file.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The RW1021 error message is usually caused by either an actual I/O
error when reading a file (it doesn't exist, or there are network or
drive problems) or by corruption of the actual file itself, which
causes the RC compiler to report a read error.
<P>
RW1021 can also be caused by running LINK version 5.6 on Windows NT
version 3.5.  This version of the linker is compatible with Windows NT
version 3.1.
<P>
Using VBX controls from Far Point with Visual C++, version 1.5, can also
cause this error during resource binding.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If you are using Far Point VBX controls, the solution is to use LINK,
version 5.5, from Visual C++, version 1.0, with the /CO:N option; however,
keep using the CVPACK, version 4.26, from Visual C++, version 1.5. NOTE:
LINK 5.5 cannot be used within the Visual Workbench, version 1.5 if it is
running on NT 3.1
<P>
If you are not using Far Point VBX controls, check for one of the
following, all of which have been known to cause this error:

<UL><LI>Bad TMP or TEMP environment variables: Make sure that there are no extra
   spaces, semicolons, or control characters in these variables. Make sure
   that they point to drives and directories that are both valid and have
   enough free disk space. If either variable is incorrect, erase the lines
   in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file that set the offending variables and retype
   the settings.

<LI>No .EXE file with which to bind the .RES file: In other words, LINK was
   invoked and reported no errors, but no .EXE file was created. This can
   happen if you've used the /ONERROR:NOEXE linker option.

<LI>Disk errors: Run a disk-checking utility such as the Norton Disk Doctor
   to verify that the drive is all right.

<LI>Corrupt files: This can be caused by bad debugging information or by
   mixing incorrect versions of different utilities. Try compiling and
   linking with no debugging information, and then verify that the versions
   of the utilities are correct.

<LI>A bad version of RCDLL.DLL: Make sure that you have only one copy of
   this file on the system and that it has not been corrupted.

<LI>Network or driver problems: Make sure to disable all network and
   unnecessary TSRs and device drivers, especially any disk caches, before
   you test.

<LI>Different command interpreters: Try using COMMAND.COM instead of command
   interpreters such as 4DOS or NDOS.

<LI>Low memory: Make sure, using MEM or MEM /C, that there is at least 4 MB
   of XMS memory available. A disk cache or RAM drive may use a great deal
   of memory.

<LI>Windows NT 3.5 compatibility: Update to version 5.60.220 of the
   linker which is available on the Window NT v3.5 CD in the
   \SUPPORT\LINKER\16BIT directory.  If you have the floppy disk set

<LI>The Linker is available on MSDN, MSL and INTERNET (See below).
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If none of the suggestions in this article has helped, delete the .PDB
and .PCH files and split any large source-code files. After doing so,
do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Reduce the amount of CodeView debugging information by using /Zd
   instead of /Zi in some or all of the modules. Use a single .PDB
   file.
<P>
   -or-

<LI>Eliminate use of the .PDB files by using /Z7 instead of /Zi or /Zd.
<P>

following file is available for download from the Microsoft Software
Library:
