The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, versions 1.0 and 1.1
<LI>Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, versions 1.0 and 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In the Microsoft Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) versions 1.0 and 1.1, a
line that is greater than 128 characters may be corrupted if the "Arg
Linsert" function is executed on that line.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the PWB versions 1.0
and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here as it becomes available.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Arg+Linsert form of the Linsert function is designed to move the
current line so that the first nonblank character is in the column
where the cursor resides; however, instead of moving over as expected,
lines longer than 128 characters may lose some characters in the
middle.
<P>
This behavior may be demonstrated by following these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Enter a line of text beginning in column 1 that goes past column
   128.

<P><LI>Press the END key to go to the end of the line and note the column
   number of the cursor.

<P><LI>Move the cursor to column 10 and press ALT+A (Arg) followed by
   CTRL+N (Linsert).

<P><LI>Press END again and observe the column number of the cursor.
<P>
</OL>The whole line will move over so that the line now begins in column
10. Therefore, the column for the end of the line should be 10 greater
than the original position; however, the end of the line is in the
same position it was in before the move. If you check the line
carefully, you will find that 10 characters are missing from somewhere
in the middle.
