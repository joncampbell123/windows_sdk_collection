SYMPTOMS
=======+
<P>
Attempting to access the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0
sample help programs through the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) version
1.00 or 1.10 online help system will generate an error. For example,
the following message results from trying to view the file C.ASM:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot open [$ASMEX:MIXED\C.ASM]: Not found

</PRE>Selecting any one of the sample programs should cause a copy of the
program to be loaded into the help window, but the DOS version of PWB
generates the above message instead.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The following three methods may be used to work around this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Change directories to the MASM 6.0 samples subdirectory (by
   default, this is C:\MASM\SAMPLES). This can be easily accomplished
   if the ASMEX environment variable has been correctly set to point
   to your samples directory. Choose Open on the File menu and type in
   "$ASMEX:" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER. Next,
   choose Cancel to return to the editor. Attempts to access sample
   program files from the online help will now be successful as long
   as you do not change the current directory.
<P>
</OL>- or -

<OL><P><LI>Load the file directly into the editor. The programs will be in one
   of four subdirectories under the MASM 6.0 samples directory:
   \DEMOS, \TSR, \MIXED, or \SHOW. Choose Open on the File menu, and
   then there are three ways to open the sample files:
<P>
   a. Switch to the directory of the desired example file by using the
<P><PRE>      dialog box controls and then select the desired file.
</PRE><P>
   b. Enter the full path name of the file and press ENTER, for
<P><PRE>      example:
</PRE><P>
<PRE>         C:\MASM\SAMPLES\MIXED\C.ASM

   c. Use the ASMEX environment variable to specify the path to the
      file, for example:

         $ASMEX:MIXED\C.ASM

</PRE></OL>- or -

<OL><P><LI>Access the online help through the QuickHelp utility. The sample
   help files are correctly located by QuickHelp.
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the products listed at the
beginning of this article.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To reproduce this error, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Choose Contents on the PWB Help menu.

<P><LI>Choose Assembly in the "Languages" section of the main "Microsoft
   Advisor Help System" screen.

<P><LI>Choose Example Code in the "Related Programs" section of the "MASM
   6.00 Contents" help screen.

<P><LI>Choose Mixed Languages from the "Example Code" selection screen.

<P><LI>Choose a file, such as C.ASM, and the above error will be
   displayed.
