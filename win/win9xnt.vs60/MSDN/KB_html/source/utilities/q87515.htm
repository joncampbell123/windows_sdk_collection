The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft NMAKE for MS-DOS, versions 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, and 1.2
<LI>Microsoft NMAKE for OS/2, versions 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, and 1.21
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If an NMAKE version 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.2, or 1.21 INCLUDE macro,
which can be used to modify the include environment variable, is
created from other macros, the text substitution will not be done
when there is an implied use of the include environment variable
with the !INCLUDE directive.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do not use macros to redefine the
include environment variable. For example, change the assignment
from
<P>
<PRE>   INCLUDE=$(INCLUDE1);$(INCLUDE2)

</PRE>to
<P>
<PRE>   INCLUDE=C:\DIR1;C:\DIR2

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in NMAKE versions
1.11, 1.12, 1.13, and 1.2 for MS-DOS and versions 1.11, 1.12, 1.13,
and 1.21 for OS/2. This problem was corrected in NMAKE version 1.3.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
In the following example, the INCLUDE macro is created from the
INCLUDE1 and INCLUDE2 macros. When the !INCLUDE is executed, NMAKE
will search the directories pointed to by the include environment
variable for the file TEST.INC.
<P>
However, at this point the INCLUDE macro is still equal to
$(INCLUDE1);$(INCLUDE2) and has not been expanded out to
C:\DIR1;C:\DIR2, so the include environment variable has not been
modified yet. If the file TEST.INC is not in the current directory,
NMAKE will generate the error:
<PRE>   fatal error U1052: file 'test.inc' not found

</PRE>If the INCLUDE macro is explicitly used in a command line, it will be
expanded correctly.
<P>
<P><h3>Sample Makefile</h3>
 
<P>
<PRE>/* Command line options needed: None
*/

</PRE>INCLUDE1=C:\DIR1
INCLUDE2=C:\DIR2
<P>
INCLUDE=$(INCLUDE1);$(INCLUDE2)
<P>
!INCLUDE &lt;TEST.INC&gt;
