The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, versions 1.0 and 1.1
<LI>Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, versions 1.0 and 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) is an environment capable of
utilizing different compilers for mixed-language programming. When
installed during BASIC version 7.10 setup, PWB version 1.10 shows
build options for the BASIC language only. However, it is possible to
include other language compilers to utilize the full features of the
PWB utility.
<P>
The following information applies to the Programmer's WorkBench
version 1.10 utility supplied with Microsoft BASIC Professional
Development System (PDS) version 7.10 for MS-DOS and MS OS/2.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Note that the 1.00 version of PWB is shipped with Microsoft C
Professional Development System (PDS) version 6.00. The steps below
should also apply to PWB version 1.00.
<P>
The Programmer's WorkBench (PWB.EXE) is an advanced development
environment capable of integrating several language compilers,
NMAKE.EXE, LINK.EXE, and the CodeView debugger. It offers the ability
to accomplish tasks, such as program development under protected mode
and mixed-language programming. This ability is not available in the
QuickBASIC extended development environment (QBX.EXE).
<P>
Two special files, PWBC.PX$ (for protected mode OS/2) and PWBC.MX$
(for DOS mode), reside on the BASIC PDS 7.10 disks and support the
option of using the C compiler in PWB. Since SETUP.EXE (in BASIC PDS
7.10) does not copy PWBC.PX$ and PWBC.MX$ during installation, these
files must be unpacked and transferred to your machine, for example to
the \BINP subdirectory located in the \BC7 directory. (Note: The
UNPACK.EXE utility is found on disk 1 of the BASIC PDS package.) After
unpacking, the files will have the names PWBC.PXT and PWBC.MXT.
<P>
Next, the following command lines must be added to the TOOLS.INI file
to make the C compiler available to PWB:
<P>
<PRE>   [pwb - .BAS .BI]
      LOAD: LogicalDrive:\[Path]\PWBC.PXT

</PRE>For further information about installing PWBC.PXT and PWBC.MXT, see
Page 54 of the "Microsoft BASIC 7.1: Getting Started" manual.
<P>
If you want to program in languages other than BASIC or C [such as
Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), Microsoft Pascal, Microsoft FORTRAN,
or Microsoft COBOL 3.00/3.00a], the following steps will insert the
initial build options to include other languages to PWB's build
options menu. In the example below, options to include the MASM.EXE
assembler are specified. If some other language's compiler is desired,
substitute appropriate changes for that compiler, where noted in the
specified areas:

<OL><P><LI>In PWB, go to the Options menu and select Build Options.

<P><LI>Choose Save Current Build Options.

<P><LI>Enter a meaningful message, such as "Options to Include MASM" in
    the window's edit field (if some other language is desired, change
    MASM to the appropriate name). Select the OK button from the "Save
    Current Build Options" and "Build Options" windows.

<P><LI>Open the "TOOLS.INI" file in the PWB utility and go down to the
    bottom of the file. Somewhere near the bottom should be the tag
    "[PWB-Build Options: Options to Include MASM]" (or the language
    that was specified).

<P><LI>In this section, add the following NMAKE instructions:
<P>
       build: inference .asm.obj masm_asm_obj
       build: command masm_asm_obj "masm $&lt;;"
<P>
    Note: For languages other than MASM, distinguish a variable name
    in the inference rule to be used in the commands line (such as
    masm_asm_obj has been used above) and then specify the appropriate
    compiler in the commands line within the quotation marks. The
    special filename macro specified in the quotation marks, "$&lt;",
    applies the command to any object that has an out-of-date
    executable file.

<P><LI>Press SHIFT+F8 to reinitialize the file and then close it.

<P><LI>Go to the File menu and select New (it is a good idea to close any
    files that are currently open before this step).

<P><LI>Go to the Options menu and select Build Options.

<P><LI>Choose Initial Build Options.

<P><LI>Select the "Options to Include MASM" option (it should be near the
    bottom of the list).
<P>
</OL>After completing these instructions, the PWB utility will now be ready
to compile assembler along with BASIC source code, provided that paths
to the necessary compilers are furnished.
