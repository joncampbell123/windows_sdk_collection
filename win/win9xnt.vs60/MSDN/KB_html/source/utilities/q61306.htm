The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, versions 1.0 and 1.1
<LI>Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, versions 1.0 and 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Under certain circumstances, the Browse options within the Programmer's
WorkBench (PWB) may be unavailable. You can take all the steps
outlined in the documentation required to generate a Browse Database,
but the Browse options may be still grayed out.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The most likely cause is an invalid CURRENT.STS file. This file can be
found in the INIT directory or the current working directory.
CURRENT.STS is used to save the PWB settings from session to session.
If this file is in a form that is not acceptable to the PWB, strange
results may occur during use of the PWB.
<P>
One instance in which CURRENT.STS might become corrupt is in the case
of a system crash from within the PWB during a compile.
<P>
To determine if a corrupt CURRENT.STS is the cause of the problem,
take the following steps:

<OL><P><LI>Invoke the PWB with the /DS switch to force it to ignore the
   CURRENT.STS file.
<P>
   Note: This will reset all switches within the environment that
   were previously recorded by CURRENT.STS.

<P><LI>Take the normal steps required for preparing a Browse database.
   (Set a program list, mark Generate Browse Information under the
   Browse options menu, and rebuild the project.)
<P>
</OL>Browse information should now be available. If disabling the
CURRENT.STS does remedy the situation, the only permanent solution is
to delete the CURRENT.STS file that is causing the problem.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Two possible solutions are deleting the make file and letting the PWB
regenerate it, or deleting the CURRENT.STS file and resetting all the
options for the editor.
<P>
NOTE: Since deleting the CURRENT.STS file will result in the loss of
all environment settings, it is advisable to note any important
settings you may have set up before deleting the file.
