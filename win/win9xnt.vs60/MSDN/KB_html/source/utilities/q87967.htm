<PRE>  - Microsoft CodeView for Windows, versions 4.0 and 4.01
</PRE> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft CodeView for Windows (CVW) version 4.0 and 4.01 may not work with
a DLL that has been dynamically loaded, freed, and loaded again. Problems
include not stopping on existing breakpoints, not allowing new breakpoints,
watches displaying invalid or incorrect data, and mixed source/assembly
mode showing the wrong code.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
CVW associates source lines and symbols with addresses when programs and
DLLs are loaded into memory. When Windows loads, frees, and loads a DLL
again, the DLL may be loaded into a new area of memory. CVW is not updating
the addresses of the symbols when this occurs.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
If the DLL is loaded by another program before CVW is used, the DLL is not
loaded or freed by the program that is being debugged. Windows will not
load more than one copy of a DLL. It will just increase or decrease the
instance count of the DLL when the program is being debugged.
<P>
The solution to this problem is to create a stub program that loads the
DLLs that are being dynamically loaded. This program can be run before
running CVW.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft CodeView for
Windows versions 4.0 and 4.01. This problem was corrected in CodeView
version 4.1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A dynamically loaded DLL is a DLL that is loaded using the
LoadLibrary() Windows API function.
