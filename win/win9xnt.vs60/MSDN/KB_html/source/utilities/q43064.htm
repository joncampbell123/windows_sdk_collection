<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
In NMAKE, the backslash "\" character has two different meanings
depending on the context in which it is used. It can be used as a line-
continuation character or as a path specifier.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The backslash is used primarily as a line-continuation character. For
example, if a dependency line in your makefile extends to more than
one line, use the backslash to continue it to the next line. You can
place a space prior to the backslash or append it directly to the last
dependent file, as the following examples demonstrate:
<P>
TARGET1: obj1 obj2 obj3 obj4 obj5 \
<PRE>  obj6 obj7

</PRE>TARGET2: obj1 obj2 obj3 obj4 obj5\
<PRE>  obj6 obj7

</PRE>NMAKE also uses the backslash as a path specifier. When a backslash is
the last character on a line and is used as a path specifier, place a
caret "^" character before the backslash to override its default use
as a line-continuation character.
<P>
The following macro definition demonstrates using the backslash as a
path specifier.
<P>
exe_dir = c:\bin^\
<P>
In the following case, NMAKE interprets the trailing backslash as a
line-continuation character which is contrary to the meaning the
context requires:
<P>
exe_dir = c:\bin\
<P>
In a macro, specifying two backslashes in succession ("\\") nullifies
its use as a line-continuation character. However, when NMAKE expands
the macro, both backslash characters appear and an incorrect path
results.
