<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When installing the Microsoft Source Profiler version 1.0 to work in
conjunction with other Microsoft language products, there are several
setup issues that may need to be addressed to avoid problems or
confusion.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The default for the Profiler Setup program is to create the following
directory structure:
<P>
<PRE>   \PROFILER\BIN     - MS-DOS/Windows binary and .BAT files
   \PROFILER\BINP    - OS/2 protected mode binary and .CMD files
   \PROFILER\HELP    - PROFILER.HLP and new PWB.HLP
   \PROFILER\INIT    - TOOLS.PRE
   \PROFILER\SAMPLES - Sample files for BASIC, C, FORTRAN, and TAB
                       output

</PRE>For the Profiler to work correctly with other Microsoft language
products, some of the files in these directories should either be
moved or their contents should be added to existing system files. To
ensure your system is configured correctly, perform the following
steps:

<OL><P><LI>Move PWBPROF.MXT from the \BIN directory to the directory that
   contains the DOS version of PWB so that it will automatically be
   loaded along with the other extensions.

<P><LI>Move PWBPROF.PXT from the \BINP directory to the directory that
   contains the protected mode version of PWB so that it will
   automatically be loaded along with the other extensions.

<P><LI>Place PROFILER.HLP and PWB.HLP in a directory pointed to by the
   HELPFILES environment variable. Since it is important to use the
   new PWB.HLP rather than an existing version from a language
   product, the best method is to copy these files from the new
   \PROFILER\HELP directory to the language \HELP directory that
   contains your existing help files. If you want to conserve disk
   space, you can then then delete the files in the \PROFILER\HELP
   directory.

<P><LI>Follow the instructions on pages 9 and 10 of the "Microsoft Source
   Profiler User's Guide" in order to properly configure your system's
   CONFIG.SYS, AUTOEXEC.BAT, STARTUP.CMD, TOOLS.INI, and Windows
   SYSTEM.INI files.

<P><LI>If desired, you can conserve further disk space by deleting the
   SAMPLES directories and files for languages that you do not have or
   use.
