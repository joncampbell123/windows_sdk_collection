The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft CodeView for MS-DOS, versions 3.0, 3.11, 3.14, 4.0,
   4.01, 4.05, and 4.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Quarterdeck Expanded Memory Manager (by Quarterdeck Office
Systems), otherwise known as QEMM386, and 386MAX (by Qualitas) are
memory managers providing support for expanded and VCPI-extended
memory, the High Memory Area (HIMEM), and Upper Memory Blocks for
machines using the 80386 or 80486 processor.
<P>
Some customers have reported difficulties loading CodeView versions
3.x into extended memory when running under these managers. This
article deals with the errors, difficulties, and solutions regarding
compatibility issues among CodeView, QEMM, and/or 386MAX.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The first thing to check is the version of CodeView in use. CodeView
version 3.0 is not VCPI (Virtual Control Program Interface)
compatible, and therefore cannot be loaded into extended memory when
QEMM or 386MAX is resident. If you are using CodeView 3.0, you should
upgrade to a later version that is VCPI-compatible.
<P>
To make CodeView VCPI compatible, a change was necessary to allow
access to the memory manager using that management scheme. Since VCPI
is a superset of LIM 4.0, the first thing CodeView does is make a call
to the LIM driver to determine if it exists. This call actually
attempts to establish a 64K page frame. If this is not possible,
CodeView assumes there is no VCPI driver and looks for other methods
to load itself and the symbol table.
<P>
The most common mistake with QEMM is to use either the FRAME=NONE or
the NOEMS switch. In both cases, CodeView can't allocate the 64K EMS
page frame it requires. The same problem occurs when using 386MAX with
the NOFRAME or EMS=0 switch.
<P>
The other switches in QEMM and 386MAX are compatible with CodeView.
Care must be taken, however, to ensure that the allocation scheme
leaves enough VCPI memory for CodeView.
<P>
For example, if QEMM (or 386MAX) is configured so that there are four
megabytes (MB) of extended memory available and no expanded memory,
and a RAM drive is loaded to take up 3.5 MB, CodeView will not be able
to load because there will not be enough available extended memory.
Note that this is the simplest case and that there are many options
and combinations of options that could cause this type of problem.
<P>
The examples below illustrate various command-line options for
CodeView, QEMM, and 386MAX along with the resultant output.
<P>
Notes:

<OL><P><LI>Version 5.10 of QEMM386 and version 5.10 of 386MAX have been used
   for these examples.

<P><LI>386MAX can a command file (386MAX.PRO) to replace command-line
   switches. This file contains all the necessary options for 386MAX
   to load as the user has defined. For purposes of readability, only
   command-line options will be used in the examples.

<P><LI>BLUEMAX is a version of 386MAX that runs on a PS/2 and provides
   extra capabilities for that platform. For the purposes of this
   article, BLUEMAX and 386MAX can be considered identical.

<P><LI>Only one memory manager should be present at any one time. These
   examples contain the command line and results for both QEMM and
   386MAX for the purpose of seeing the result of what each line
   contains.

<P><LI>All of these examples assume that there is enough expanded or
   extended memory to completely load CodeView and the entire
   application program. If not, be aware that CodeView will not use
   disk overlays to load into conventional memory if it was able to
   partially load into any area above the 640K DOS boundary. If an
   "Out of Memory" error occurs, a common solution is to use the
   CVPACK.EXE utility included with the compiler.
