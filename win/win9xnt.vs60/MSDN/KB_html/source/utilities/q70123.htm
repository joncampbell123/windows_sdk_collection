The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, version 1.1
<LI>Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, version 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Under Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) version 1.10, the settings for the
environment variables INCLUDE, LIB, and HELPFILES are stored in state
(.STS) files under the [environ] tag. (These settings were not stored
in PWB version 1.00.)
<P>
When PWB starts, it will set its internal environment to the values in
the .STS file regardless of how the environment is set when you type
"PWB".
<P>
This can be a special problem when starting PWB for the first time if
you've forgotten to run the NEW-VARS.BAT (or NEW-VARS.CMD under OS/2)
batch file. In this case, PWB records the null environment variables
in the .STS file. When it restarts, it will use the null values that
were previously recorded in the .STS file, even if you run the
NEW-VARS file before starting PWB the second time. The workarounds
below work well in this situation, too.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Here is how PWB reads .STS files when it starts:

<OL><P><LI>If a program list is set, PWB reads the environment information
   from the &lt;program list&gt;.STS file in the same directory as the
   program list.

<P><LI>If no program list is set, this information is read from the
   CURRENT.STS file in the INIT directory.

<P><LI>If no program list is set and no CURRENT.STS file exists, the
   environment is read from the DOS command shell.
<P>
</OL>Any changes to these three environment variables made with the MS-DOS Set
command will not be recognized in PWB if the CURRENT.STS or &lt;program
list&gt;.STS files exist.
<P>
The following are three possible ways of changing the INCLUDE, LIB,
and HELPFILES environment variables:

<OL><P><LI>Modify the variables in the Environment dialog box under the
   Options menu in PWB.

<P><LI>Delete the .STS files.

<P><LI>Modify the environment variables under the [environ] tag in the
   .STS files. (Microsoft doesn't recommend doing this, but it can
<P><PRE>    be done this way.)
