The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, versions 1.0 and 1.1
<LI>Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, versions 1.0 and 1.1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Assigning functions to certain keys and attempting to invoke those
functions while a Help window is active does not work as expected
in the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) versions 1.0 and 1.1. If any
other window is active, the functions are invoked as expected by
the assigned keystrokes.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Some keys have fixed meanings that override any user assignments
while inside the PWB help system. These keys and their Help system
functionality are as follows:
<P>
<PRE>      Key(s)                       Functionality
      ------                       -------------

      TAB                          Next Hyperlink

      SHIFT+TAB                    Previous Hyperlink

      SPACEBAR, ENTER,             Activate current hyperlink
      numeric keypad ENTER         (includes shifted versions of these
      (NUMENTER)                   keys)

      &lt;character&gt;                  Go to next link beginning with
                                   &lt;character&gt;

      SHIFT+&lt;chararcter&gt;           Go to previous link beginning with
                                   &lt;character&gt;

      ESC                          Cancel Help

</PRE><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Since the above keystrokes have predefined meanings in the Help
window, any functions needed in a Help window should be assigned to
other keys, or the default keystrokes should be used while the Help
window is active.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
PWB allows user assignment of all keys. For example, the "arg"
function is assigned to ALT+A by default, but it could also be
assigned to the ENTER key on the numeric keypad (NUMENTER) by placing
the following line under the [PWB] tagged section of the TOOLS.INI
file:
<P>
<PRE>   arg:NumEnter

</PRE>If you make this assignment and activate a PWB Help window, NUMENTER
will not perform the arg function (though ALT+A still will). In fact,
if a hyperlink button is highlighted, the NUMENTER key will execute
the link as if the ENTER key had been pressed, since that is the
NUMENTER functionality in a Help Window. Pressing NUMENTER while any
other window is active will invoke the arg function.
