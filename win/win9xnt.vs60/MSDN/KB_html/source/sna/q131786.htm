The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.0 and 2.1
<P>
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to install the 33rd SNA Server DLC 802.2 link service, SNA
Server Setup fails with the following error:
<P>
<PRE>   The installation process failed

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The SNA Server setup program generates a unique link service name during
installation of SNA Server DLC 802.2 link services. The link service names
are generated as follows:
<P>
<PRE>  SNADLC1, SNADLC2, ... SNADLC9, SNADLCA, SNADLCB ... SNADLCU

</PRE>However, after SNADLCU, the link service name generation fails, causing a
link service name of SNADLC to be generated for the 32nd, and all
additional, link services. When the 33rd link service is installed (with
a name of SNADLC), the 32nd link service already exists with that name.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This restriction only affects customers who want SNA Server to emulate more
than 32 physical units to the same host system, through a single host TIC
address. In this configuration, a unique link service must be defined for
each PU, where each link service would be configured with a unique local
SAP address. For more information, see <B><A href="../sna/q107192.htm">Q107192</A></B>.
<P>
Because multiple connections to the same AS/400 are not supported, AS/400
connections are not affected For more information, see <B><A href="../sna/q131625.htm">Q131625</A></B>.
<P>
SNA Server supports up to 128 unique 802.2 connections over a single 802.2
link service. The restriction described here affect only configurations
involving more than 32 802.2 link services.
<P>
Each 802.2 link service configured over a given adapter must have a unique
SAP address. The first SNA SAP address is 0x4, with subsequent SAP
addresses specified in multiples of 4 (for example, 0x04, 0x08, 0x0c, 0x10,
0x14, etc.), through 0xEC (addresses from 0xF0-FF can't be used). Because
the SAP address is a single digit, only 59 SNA SAP addresses (and, thus
SNA DLC 802.2 link services) can be configured over one adapter.
<P>
Because the problem exists in SNA Setup when generating a link service
name, regardless of the number of LAN adapters installed in the server,
adding a second LAN adapter does not alleviate the problem.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To correct this problem, upgrade to SNA Server version 2.11. Link service
names are now generated using 1 or 2 digit index with base 36. For example:
<P>
<PRE>   SNADLC1,  SNADLC2,  ... SNADLC9,  SNADLCA, ... SNADLCZ,  SNADLC10,
   SNADLC11, SNADLC12, ... SNADLC19, SNADLC1A ... SNADLC1Z, SNADLC20,
   ...

</PRE>There is no workaround for customers using SNA Server 2.0 or 2.1. These
versions are limited to 32 unique 802.2 link services.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.0
and 2.1. This problem was corrected in SNA Server version 2.11.
