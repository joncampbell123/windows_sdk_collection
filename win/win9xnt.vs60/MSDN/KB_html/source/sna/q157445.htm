<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server version 2.11 Service Pack 1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you activate an SNA Server connection using a Distributed Link
Service, the connection may remain inactive and never activate. The
following event will be logged in the Windows NT Application Event Log
where SNA Server is running:
<P>
<PRE>   Event 77
   Source: SNA Server

   Connection &lt;connection name&gt; failed to activate due to failure at
   link service.

   Error Code = 0D0D

</PRE>where 0D0D = Link Service not active on remote server
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Distributed Link Service (SNAREMLS.DLL) was not allocating a buffer
large enough to read the list of link services from the registry, causing
the end of the link service data (for example, the service name) to be
truncated. The error occurs when the distributed link service tried to
locate the link service on the remote computer, and the service name was
not found because the service name was truncated.
<P>
To identify that this problem is occurring, the following entries will
appear in internal traces. On the computer running the Distributed Link
Service (or "SnaRem1", "SnaRem2", ...), internal SnaRem# traces will
include the following:
<P>
<PRE>   GRLSN  Remote Services = \\sna_central_gw\snadlc2
   GRLSN  Read service name "\\SNA_CENTRAL_GW\SNADLC2"
    :
    :
   reslc  Try link service 0 "\\SNA_CENTRAL_GW\SNADLC2?"
   reslc  Remote link service is \\SNA_CENTRAL_GW\SNADLC2?
   DFIND   Look in DOMAIN 0 SHR a040000
   DFIND  Open type = 0
   DFIND  Locate remote link service \\SNA_CENTRAL_GW\SNADLC2?

</PRE>NOTE: The question mark (?) at the end of the link service name may be any
"garbage" character.
<P>
On the computer running the SNADLC2 (remote) link service, SnaBase
internal traces will include:
<P>
<PRE>   SVCED  Searching for service SNADLC2?, type 11
   SVCED  Service SNADLC2?, type 11 not found

</PRE>NOTE: The question mark (?) at the end of the link service name indicates
that while this server does support a link service called SNADLC2, it is
not found.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Add a semi-colon (;) character to the start and end of the Distributed Link
Service name(s) specified during SNA Server Setup of the Distributed Link
Service. For the example above, enter the following:
<P>
<PRE>   Remote Link Services: [;\\sna_central_gw\snadlc2;      ]

</PRE>A hotfix for this problem is available from Microsoft.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server
version 2.11 Service Pack 1.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
