The information in this article applies to:

   3.0 (all service packs)

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
A 16-bit Windows application which uses the APPC, CPIC, or LUA interfaces
may hang when running over the SNA Server Windows 3.x client TCP/IP 
sockets interface. This problem can occur on either WFW/Windows 3.x or 
Windows 95. This problem may only occur when the client is configured 
for TCP/IP sockets. The application may work correctly when the SNA Server 
Windows 3.x client is configured to use named pipes or Netware ipx/spx.
<P>
There are two main scenarios where this has been observed:

<OL><P><LI>If the 16-bit application isn't "peeking" on messages to all windows 
   handles.
</OL>2. If the Windows SNA startup call is made from a different windows
<PRE>   process than the SNA API calls are made from.

</PRE></OL>These scenarios are described in more detail below.
<P>
NOTE: When running on Windows NT, a 16-bit Windows application that uses
the APPC, CPIC, or LUA interfaces can run over the SNA Server Windows NT
client software, through the 16-to-32-bit SNA "thunking" DLL's. By using
these thunking DLL's on the SNA Server Windows NT client software, the
problems described in this article do not occur.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Normally, a 16-bit Windows application which uses the SNA Server 
Windows 3.x SNA API's should function properly regardless of the LAN 
interface used by the underlying SNA Windows 3.x client software.  
However, the application may encounter problems when running over the 
SNA client when configured for TCP/IP sockets because the underlying 
architecture of the socket interface has special requirements for the 
16-bit Windows calling application.
<P>
If a 16-bit Windows application fails to work on top of the SNA Windows
client TCP/IP sockets interface, here are the possible causes.

<OL><P><LI>If the 16-bit application isn't "peeking" on messages to all 
   Window handles.
<P>
   Unlike named pipes and Netware IPX/SPX, the Windows 3.x TCP/IP socket
   interface runs within the non-preemptive Windows architecture,
   underneath the calling application. When the SNA Windows 3.x client
   makes calls to named pipes or Netware IPX/SPX, which run outside of
   Windows, the network i/o is accomplished with no requirements of the
   16-bit Windows application.
<P>
   However, when the SNA Windows 3.x client is configured for TCP/IP 
   sockets, the 16-bit Windows application must "peek" on messages
   intended for any Windows handle, in order for the underlying SNA
   client software to receive data from the TCP/IP sockets interface.
<P>
   So, in order for the Windows application to work over TCP/IP sockets,
   the application's Windows message loop should be architected as 
   follows:
<P>
<P><PRE>      /*  get the next message if any */
      if ( PeekMessage ( &amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0, PM_NOREMOVE) ) {
<PRE></PRE>         if ( msg.message = WM_QUIT )
            return FALSE;   // let app process WM_QUIT
         PeekMessage ( &amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0, PM_REMOVE) ;
         TranslateMessage (&amp;msg) ;
         DispatchMessage (&amp;msg) ;
     }

   The second parameter passed to PeekMessage(), the Window handle (hWnd),
   must be NULL in order for the underlying TCP/IP sockets interface to 
   receive messages on behalf of the application. 

   NOTE: If an API communication layer is being developed (for example, an
   ODBC/DRDA driver), the developer may not have control over the 
   architecture of the calling application. If this is occurring, then the
   following strategy can be used to function over TCP/IP sockets:

   - When SNA client is running over Winsock it makes a hidden window with 
     class name "SNA Winsock".  For the other transports, it's "SNA Server".  

   - During initialization of the API communication layer, call EnumWindows 
     and find one whose class starts with "SNA ".  

   - Establish an SNA blocking hook which dispatches messages only for this 
     window.  

   - Call OpenFile (IF_EXIST) on WINSOCK.DLL.  If it exists, call LoadLibrary. 
     If not, do not call LoadLibrary since this will put a dialog on the
     screen if it can't find the DLL.

   - Call GetProcAddress for WSAStartup and WSASetBlockingHook, and set a 
     Winsock blocking hook that doesn't dispatch any messages.

</PRE><P><LI>If the Windows SNA startup call is made from a different windows
   process than the SNA API calls are made from.
<P>
   If a Windows application calls the APPC, CPIC or LUA interface, the
   application should first call WinAPPCStartup, WinCPICStartup, or 
   WinRUIStartup/WinSLIStartup respectively.  This startup call should be 
   performed when the Windows process first initializes, before initiating 
   a session over the SNA interface.
<P>
   A hang has been observed if a Windows 3.x application calls WinAPPCStartup 
   from one Windows process, and then calls the APPC interface from another 
   Windows process. Later versions of the SNA Windows 3.x client software 
   (3.0 and later) now allow a Windows 3.x application to invoke an APPC 
   conversation without first calling WinAPPCStartup. However, the application
   should still call WinAPPCStartup. If an application calls WinAPPCStartup
   from one process, and then calls APPC functions from another process,
   the application may hang if TCP/IP sockets is being used.
<P>
   To correct this problem, the WinAPPCStartup call should be moved to the
   process which is actually using the APPC interface, or the WinAPPCStartup
   and WinAPPCCleanup calls should be removed from the Windows application.
