<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When invoking a file transfer using the Data Connection NetView/DM Agent
(NDMA) on a computer running SNA Server, all 3270 client user requests
"hang" until the file transfer has completed. When running a 3270 emulator
on the server, a 3270 request does get processed, but the response time is
very slow.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Data Connection NetView/DM Agent uses the LUA RUI API to communicate
with the host. Even though the LUA LU being used was defined as a
"low priority LU" (that is, the "high priority LU" checkbox on the LUA LU
definition within SNA Server Admin is not checked), SNA Server was queuing
the LUA application requests in a high-priority internal queue, ahead of
3270 user requests.  All user requests made on 3270 LU sessions are always
defined as "high priority," though they were not being properly handled as
high priority.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
A fix is available to correct this problem.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server
versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 Service Pack 1 (SP1), and 3.0.
A supported fix is now available for SNA Server versions 2.11 and 3.0, but
has not been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by
this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next
Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support
for more information.
