The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If the SNA Server Host Account Synchronization service (SNAHOSTPROCESS) is
started with an existing host security domain defined in SNA Server
Manager, and a new host security domain is defined, the Host Account
Synchronization service must be restarted before it will recognize the new
host security domain.
<P>
Until this service is restarted, password changes for this new host
security domain are ignored.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The SNA Server Host Account Synchronization service was not detecting the
creation of new host security domains, after it was already started.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
An update to SNA Server 3.0 is available to correct this problem.
<P>
The Host Account Synchronization service (SNAHOSTPROCESS) now dynamically
detects changes to the host security domain definitions (including
addition and removal of host security domains). Note that the following
restrictions apply:

<UL><LI>Changes to existing host security domains do not take effect until
   the Host Account Synchronization service is restarted.

<LI>When a new host security domain is added or removed, the Domains
   registry key and values are written within the registry. When this
   occurs, the SNAHOSTPROCESS is notified of the change, and attempts to
   load the associated security DLL for the host security domain.
<P>
   NOTE: For vendors implementing installation programs for their host
   security agents, the installation program should copy over the
   security DLL at the very end of their installation, before updating
   the registry with the new configuration information. This will ensure
   that the SNAHOSTPROCESS will not attempt to initialize the security DLL
   before the installation has completed.

<LI>The SNAHOSTPROCESS service will no longer exit even if there are no
   active host security domains.
<P>
</UL>The updated module is:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;Snaroot&gt;\System\Hostproc.exe

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
