The information in this article applies to:
<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0. 
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft SNA Server does not offer a configurable option to verify the old password in a host-initiated password change before executing the change. This field is currently ignored. In addition, the SNA Server Host Account Manager (UDCONFIG.EXE) does not prompt you to enter your old password when updating the SNA Server host account cache for your account.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This functionality was not implemented in the initial release of SNA Server 3.0.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
There are two changes implemented in SNA Server Host Security Integration relating to the handling of old passwords.

<OL><P><LI>The ability to require the host to send the correct old host password to SNA Server. When the host initiates a password change, the SNA Server host security agent will now verify that the old password sent by the host is valid for the account if the following registry entry is set:
<P>
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
	\SYSTEM
		\CurrentControlSet
			\Services
				\SNAPmp
<PRE>					\Parameters   ValidateHostRequest: REG_DWORD: 1

</PRE></OL>If enabled, (REG_DWORD=1), the Host must supply the old password for the user to apply any changes.

<OL><P><LI>Requires user to enter old password in SNA Host Account Manager.The Host Account Manager configurator now requires you to enter your old password before allowing the password to be updated. The updated modules are: &lt;snaroot&gt;\system\hostproc.exe snaroot&gt;\system\snaudb.exe &lt;snaroot&gt;\system\snapmp.exe &lt;snaroot&gt;\snafile.stf
<P>
</OL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0.
<P>
<P>
A supported fix is now available for 3.0, but has not been fully regression-
tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific 
problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft 
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. 
Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
