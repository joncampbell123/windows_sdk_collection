The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11 and 3.0
<LI>Microsoft SNA Workstation for Windows NT versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, and
   3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
While Windows NT or Windows NT Advanced Server supports Windows 3.x, MS-
DOS, and character-based OS/2 applications, SNA Application Programming 
Interface (API) support on Windows NT varies depending on the SNA Server 
version being used.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
<P><h3>SNA Server Version 2.0</h3>
 
<P>
The SNA Server version 2.x CD-ROM includes SNA client software for Windows
NT, Windows 3.x, MS-DOS, and OS/2 clients. However, only 32-bit Windows SNA
applications are designed to work with the SNA Server Windows NT client
software. Any SNA application designed to run on these other client
platforms are only supported on their native platform type. To summarize:

<UL><LI>Windows 3.x., MS-DOS or OS/2-based SNA applications are not supported on
   the SNA Server Windows NT client.

<LI>Windows 3.x SNA applications are not supported with the SNA Server
   Windows 3.x  client software when run on a Windows NT machine.

<LI>OS/2 SNA applications are not supported with the SNA Server OS/2 client
   software when run from a Windows NT machine.

<LI>MS-DOS SNA applications are not supported with the SNA Server MS-DOS
   client software when run from a Windows NT machine.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: SNA Workstation 2.0, the standalone Windows NT version of SNA Server
2.0, includes Win32 SNA API support for all APIs (APPC, CPIC, LUA, CSV, and
3270 EIS), though no SNA API support for Win16, MS-DOS or OS/2.
<P>
<P><h3>SNA Server Version 2.1</h3>
 
<P>
The SNA Server version 2.x CD-ROM includes SNA client software for Windows
NT, Windows 3.x, MS-DOS, and OS/2 clients.. Under Windows NT, you can
install either the SNA Server Windows NT client or the SNA Server Windows
3.x client, but not both. Only 32-bit Windows SNA applications are designed
to work with the SNA Server Windows NT client software. Any SNA application
designed to run on other client platforms are supported only on their
native platform type. To summarize:

<UL><LI>Windows 3.x, MS-DOS, and OS/2-based SNA applications are not supported
   on the SNA Server Windows NT client.

<LI>Windows 3.x SNA applications are supported with the SNA Server
   Windows 3.x client software when run on a computer running Windows NT.

<LI>OS/2 SNA applications are not supported with the SNA Server OS/2 client
   software when run from a computer running Windows NT.

<LI>MS-DOS SNA applications are not supported with the SNA Server MS-DOS
   client software when run from a computer running Windows NT.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: SNA Workstation 2.0, the standalone Windows NT version of SNA Server
2.0, includes Win32 SNA API support for all APIs (APPC, CPIC, LUA, CSV, and
3270 EIS), though no SNA API support for Win16, MS-DOS or OS/2.
<P>
<P><h3>SNA Server Version 2.11</h3>
 
<P>
SNA Server 2.11 supports "thunking" of many of the Windows 3.x SNA APIs on
the SNA Server Windows NT client software. This applies to APPC, CPIC, CSV,
LUA, and EHNAPPC interfaces. This will allow many Windows 3.x SNA
applications to run on the SNA Server Windows NT client software. However,
the SNA Server Windows 3.x Emulator Interface Specification (or "EIS", used
by many 3270 emulation products) is not supported on the SNA Server 2.11
Windows NT client software. For more information about the 3270 EIS
interface, see the SNA Server 3270 Emulator Interface Specification
included in softcopy form on the SNA Server CD-ROM.
<P>
NOTE: To support the Win16 SNA APIs on the SNA Server Win32 SNA client
software, the special thunking versions of the Win16 client DLLs must
be manually installed into the &lt;SNAROOT&gt;\SYSTEM directory. These DLLs can
be found on the SNA Server 2.11 compact disc in the
\CLIENTS\WINNT\I386\SYSTEM\THUNK directory.
<P>
NOTE: SNA Workstation 2.11, the standalone Windows NT version of SNA Server
2.11, includes Win32 SNA API support for all APIs (APPC, CPIC, LUA, CSV and
3270 EIS), as well as Win16 SNA API support for APPC, CPIC, LUA, and CSV
(but not 3270 EIS) by applying the thunk version of the DLL's as described
above.
<P>
<P><h3>SNA Server Version 3.0</h3>
 
<P>
The SNA Server version 3.0 CD-ROM includes client software for Windows NT,
Windows 3.x, MS-DOS and OS/2 clients. The SNA Server 3.0 Windows NT client
software support is unchanged from 2.11, where the Win32 SNA APIs are
supported, as well as most of the Win16 SNA APIs are supported (by applying
the thunk DLLs).
<P>
NOTE: SNA Workstation Version 3.0 has not yet been released at the time
this article was updated. When available, SNA Workstation 3.0 support is
planned to be the same as SNA Workstation Version 2.11 in this area.
<P>
Microsoft is interested in customer requests for such cross-platform SNA
application support on Windows NT. Please let us know the specific SNA
application (and platform it was written for) so that we can consider this
in a future release.
