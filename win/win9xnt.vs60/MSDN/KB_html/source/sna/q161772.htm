The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When using the ODBC driver included with IBM Client Access/400 for Windows
(V3R1M1) over the SNA Server 2.11 Windows 3.x client software, the ODBC
driver may stop responding while receiving large query responses from the
AS/400.
<P>
While receiving data, the SNA Server Windows 3.x client APPC interface
returns the following error to the CA/400 ODBC RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE call:
<P>
<PRE>   primary_rc   = 0x0001        (AP_PARAMETER_CHECK)
   secondary_rc = 0x00000006    (AP_INVALID_DATA_SEGMENT)

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The IBM Client Access/400 ODBC driver passes a 32-bit address in the dptr
"data pointer" parameter to the SNA Server Windows 3.x APPC
RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE function. To protect against memory access violations,
the SNA Server Windows 3.x APPC interface attempts to verify that the
calling application has access to the data pointer and address range
supplied to the RECEIVE_IMMEDIATE function. During this verification check,
the address is treated as a 16-bit address, causing the top 16 bits to be
truncated, in turn causing the verification to fail.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below. With this
update applied, if Client Access/400 is used (indicated by setting
CA400=YES in the [WNAP] section of the Win.ini initialization file), the
SNA Server Windows 3.x client disables address verification checking as
described above.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 2.11.
<PRE> A
</PRE>supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
