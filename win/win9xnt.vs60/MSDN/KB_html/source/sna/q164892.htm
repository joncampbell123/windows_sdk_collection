The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A computer running Microsoft SNA Server that is configured to use only
TCP/IP as the protocol for Server Broadcasts may not resume sending these
broadcasts after a network outage. If the SNA Server computer stops
sending/receiving broadcasts, the SNA Server Manager will not display an
accurate status for SNA resources in the subdomain.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When using TCP/IP, SNA Server 3.0 systems keep track of the other SNA
Servers in the subdomain by adding them to the following registry entry:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
      \SYSTEM
         \CurrentControlSet
            \Services
               \SnaBase
                  \Parameters
                     \SnaTcp
                        \LocalHosts:
                           &lt;snaserver1&gt;:REG_MULTI_SZ: &lt;ip address&gt;
                              &lt;snaserver2&gt;:REG_MULTI_SZ: &lt;ip address&gt;

</PRE>LocalHosts will contain a list of all the SNA servers in the subdomain.
<P>
This problem occurs because SnaBase was removing the names in the
LocalHosts registry entry during a network outage that lasted longer than
SnaBase's timeout of five minutes. SnaBase did not resume the server
broadcasts because there were no server names in the list for it to send
the broadcasts to.
<P>
A computer running SNA Server that is listed in the LocalHosts registry
entry should be removed only if that SNA Server is stopped. They should
not be removed because of a timeout condition such as a network outage.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
A workaround exists by adding the following registry entry
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
      \SYSTEM
         \CurrentControlSet
            \Services
               \SnaBase
                  \Parameters
                     \PermanentServers: REG_MULTI_SZ: &lt;list&gt;

</PRE>where the entries in the &lt;list&gt; are the SNA Server Names and/or IP
addresses listed on separate lines in the registry editor Multi-String
Editor Data field. SnaBase will always send service table updates to the
SNA Servers listed under this registry entry even if they are not in the
SNA Server configuration file.
<P>
The SnaBase service has been updated to prevent servers from being removed
from the LocalHosts list due to a timeout condition.
<P>
The following module has been updated:
<P>
<PRE>   \&lt;snaroot&gt;\System\Snabase.exe

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
