<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When SNA Server attempts to process two large print jobs (approximately 700
pages), the SNA 3270 Emulator logs an event 685, indicating that a failure
to extend a buffer pool occurred. The affected component is terminated and
both print jobs fail.
<P>
<PRE>   ID 685 Event Details

   An attempt was made to extend a buffer pool, but the related pool had
   reached its maximum size. The affected component is terminating, and an
   audit of the buffer pools just before termination is attached

   EXPLANATION
   This error is almost always due to either an SNA component (including
   possibly an emulator) losing buffers or a slow emulator (or RUI
   application) using a session without pacing.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The print server will occasionally produce an extra credit message.
Normally this would not cause a problem. The print server would cope with
the extra message. However, in the case of a very large job, the print
server never has time to catch up with the extra messages. The input queue
increases until the buffer limit is reached (3,000 outstanding messages).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Defer sending credit messages until the print server is capable of
processing the message immediately, so that the message is not put back on
the input queue.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA 
Server version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this 
Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
