The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, and 3.0
<LI>Windows NT Server, versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you stop the SNA Server service, the following error popup may
be displayed:
<P>
<PRE>   SNALINK.EXE - Cancel Timeout
   The driver \driver\DLC failed to complete a cancelled I/O request
   in the allotted time

</PRE>After clicking &lt;OK&gt;, the same popup may appear over and over again. The
administrator may not be able to perform any other operations until this
error is cleared.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The error message is a Windows NT "hard error popup" which occurs if the
SNA Server 802.2 link service terminates while the underlying DLC.SYS
driver has completed IRP's to return to the calling thread. However, the
link service has already ended. This error causes Windows NT to report a
system-modal hard error popup which freezes the application subsystem 
until the user cancels the dialog. If multiple IRP's are completing, 
each IRP will cause another popup to appear.
<P>
This problem will only occur when the SNA Server service is stopped, which
causes underlying SNA Server link services to stop too.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor
can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
<P>
For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
<P>
While this error may occur during SNA Server shutdown, it is recommended
that the hard error popup be suppressed by configuring the following 
Windows NT registry setting:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Windows NT/CurrentVersion/Windows
   ErrorMode: REG_DWORD: 2

</PRE>The default is 0 which causes the error popup to appear, requiring the user
to manually clear the error. This option is not recommended for Windows NT
servers which may not be accessible to users. A value of 2 causes the
error to be reported to the event log and returns OK to the hard error so 
the system can continue. Popups don't appear. This entry is described in 
the Windows NT 3.5 Resource Kit Volume 4 "Optimizing Windows NT", Appendix 
B on page 614.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be an operational issue with Windows NT
version 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0. It is recommended that the ErrorMode entry is
modified for servers which aren't normally accessible to administrator
personnel.
