The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 Service Pack 2 and 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
SNA Server clients configured to use TCP/IP sockets may experience a delay
during the initial connection to a multihomed SNA Server computer. The time
delay before getting the application session depends upon the TCP/IP retry
timers configured on the client, but should be 45 to 55 seconds assuming
the retry-timer settings have not been modified from their defaults.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Multihomed server support was added to SNA Server and SNA Server clients in
SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 2. This new feature allows the SnaBase service
to send two entries (a new entry, TCPIP2, that lists all IP addresses of
the server, and the original entry, TCPIP, that lists only one of possibly
many IP addresses associated with the server) in its service-table updates
for the TCP/IP transport. The original entry is retained for backward
compatibility with earlier-version (pre-3.0 SP2) clients and servers.
<P>
SNA Server 3.0 SP2 (and later) clients now receive all of the TCP/IP
addresses configured on the SNA Server computer. However, the clients try
to connect to the SNA Server computer by trying the TCP/IP addresses in the
order they are listed in the service-table update received from the SNA
Server computer. If the first TCP/IP address exists on a subnet that is not
reachable from the client's subnet, the client is not able to try the next
TCP/IP address in its list until the TCP/IP retry timers expire. This can
lead to a 45 to 55 second delay between connection attempts over the
different TCP/IP addresses.
<P>
Note: Once the initial connection is made, the SNA Server client will
continue to use the correct TCP/IP address for the duration of the
application session. The potential delay is only noticeable upon the
initial application startup.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 SP2
and 4.0. A supported fix is now available for SNA Server 4.0, but has not
been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by
this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next
Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support
for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
With this update applied, clients that try connecting to multihomed servers
will search the TCP/IP address list received from the server and will
choose an IP address that it is most likely to get a successful connection
based on the client's own TCP/IP address. The client will attempt to
connect to this TCP/IP address first, and if that fails, it will then try
the other addresses in the list.
<P>
If SNA Server 3.0 SP1 clients (and earlier versions) fail to connect to a
multihomed Windows NT Server 4.0 computer running SNA Server, please refer
