The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11sp1,
   3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
To automatically start SNA Server when you start your system, use the
Services application to configure the SnaServer service startup method as
Automatic. Also, if you are using NetView alerts and Run command, the
NVAlert and NVRunCmd services should also be configured to start
automatically.
<P>
For SNA Server version 2.x, all other SNA Serve services are automatically
started by SNA Server as needed, even though they are configured for manual
start (this includes any SNA Server link services and SnaNetMn). In the
case of SnaNetNm, this service displays an error message if the user
attempt to start it through Control Panel.
<P>
With SNA Server version 3.0, the following services need to be setup thru
Control Panel/Services in order to start automatically: Shared Folders
Gateway, TN3270, TN5250, SNAPrint. All other 3.0 services are started
automatically.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Following is a description of each SNA Server service, and how each service
is configured to start when SNA Server is installed:
<P>
SnaBase: Automatic startup. This service must be started before any other
<PRE>   SNA Server service can run.


   NOTE: You can configure SnaBase for manual startup where the first SNA
   application to be started causes SnaBase to start automatically.
   However, for this to work, the Windows NT user must have sufficient
   privilege to start it (that is, the user's account must belong to the
   Administrators, Server Operator, or Power User group). So, it is
   recommended that SnaBase be left at "Automatic startup".

</PRE>SnaServer: Manual startup. This can be changed to Automatic startup if
<PRE>   desired. This may also be started/stopped using the SNA Server Admin
   program.

</PRE>SNA Server link services (SnaDlc1, SnaSdlc1, and so on): Manual startup.
<PRE>   SNA Server automatically starts the link services as needed. These
   services should NOT be configured to automatically start using Control
   Panel. Specifically, the SnaBase service starts these automatically.
   Also, the SnaServer service doesn't start unless all link services used
   by this server are running.

</PRE>NVAlert, NVRunCmd: Manual startup. These services can be changed to
<PRE>   Automatic startup if desired. SNA Server will not automatically start
   these services.

</PRE>SnaNetMn: Manual startup. SNA Server will automatically start this service
<PRE>   if NetView connectivity is configured on an SNA Server connection. This
   service should NOT be configured to automatically start using Control
   Panel, and fails with the following error message if the administrator
   tries to start it manually:

      SNA Server Error #0352
      Unable to open the configuration file, rc=618
