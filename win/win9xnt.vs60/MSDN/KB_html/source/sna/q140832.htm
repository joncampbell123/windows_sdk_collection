The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, and 2.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows 3.x SNA Client Setup will fail on Windows 95 with the following 
error if an Autoexec.bat file is not present:
<P>
<PRE>   Setup is unable to detect any network on this computer. Please install a
   network and try Setup again later.

</PRE>The same error occurs when running Setup on a client that was previously
installed if the Autoexec.bat has been removed from the system.
<P>
Please refer to Knowledge Base Article <B><A href="../sna/q128118.htm">Q128118</A></B> for information on other
causes of this error message.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Setup was treating the non-existence of AUTOEXEC.BAT as an error, and
returning early from the SNAValidate function before attempting to figure
out which network protocols are installed.
<P>
While investigating this problem, another problem was discovered.  If
there's no AUTOEXEC.BAT found when Setup starts, Setup tries to create one
while modifying the system files, and writes just one line to the new
AUTOEXEC.BAT:  "PATH C:\SNA.WIN;".
<P>
The next time Setup is run, it finds AUTOEXEC.BAT, but on its way out Setup
changes the line to "PATHC:\SNA.WIN;". The next time Setup runs, it doesn't
recognize the path line, so it adds another one like the first time. This
process is repeated each time Setup is executed.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, add an AUTOEXEC.BAT to the system where the
client is being installed. The AUTOEXEC.BAT does not need to contain any
specific commands; it just needs to exist on the system.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has updated the file, WIN16CL.DLL, to correct this problem. The
Windows 3.x SNA Client Setup program now continues on with the SNAValidate
function if the AUTOEXEC.BAT does not exist. In addition, the Setup program
correctly writes the PATH statement.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT.
This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on
