The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server version 2.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Within a Windows NT domain, all SNA Servers in the domain share a common
configuration file, where only one SNA Server in the domain is designated
as the "primary" configuration server. When the SNA Admin program is
started, Admin attempts to open the primary server's configuration file in
Read/Write mode. If this open succeeds, all other users who attempt to run
SNA Admin will only be able to access the configuration file in read-only
mode.
<P>
Read/write access is needed to update the configuration file, though
read-only access still allows that administrator to start/stop SNA
Server services and view their status.
<P>
Under SNA Server 2.11, if the configuration file is already open for
read\write access and another SNA Administration program tries to open the
configuration file, the user will be prompted with the following dialog
box:
<P>
<PRE>   Insufficient privilege or the file is locked. The file is locked by
   Domain Name\User on computer (computer name). OK to open the
   configuration in read only mode?

</PRE>The user will only be able to open the configuration file for read
access at this time.
<P>
Previous versions of SNA Server Admin do not show what user has the primary
configuration file locked open for write access. If the SNA Admin program
is not running locally on the primary configuration server, then Windows NT
Server Manager can be used to determine which user has the configuration
file open in write mode. Choose Server Manager/servername/&lt;in use&gt;/ look at
which user has the &lt;COM.C$$&gt; file locked.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Under SNA Server 2.11, SNA Server Admin is able to determine who has the
configuration file open by parsing the COM.LOK file. This file is created
when the configuration file is opened for read\write access. The file is
deleted when the SNA Server Administration program that has locked the
configuration file is shutdown.
<P>
Sample COM.LOK file:
<P>
SNASERVER\Snauser SNAUSER
<P>
If this file is deleted while the COM.CFG is still locked by SNA Server
Admin then any other SNA Server Admin will not be able to tell the user (in
the popup message) who has the configuration file opened for Read\write
access.
<P>
NOTE: SNA Server Admin 2.1 and 2.11 support the ability to configure SNA
Server administration rights, using the SNA Admin Security/Permissions
dialog. Users can be granted the following rights:
<P>
No access: Disallow a particular user or group from administering SNA
Server
<P>
Read (manage only): Allow the user to open the configuration file in read
mode, so the user can view the server status and start/stop services.
<P>
Read/Write: Allow the user to manage the server and change the SNA Server
configuration.
<P>
Full control: View SNA Server status, start and stop services, change SNA
Server configuration information and assign configuration privileges for
other users.
<P>
WARNING: The SNA Server administrator should never attempt to set Windows
NT file system (NTFS) file privileges on the primary SNA Server
configuration file. The SNA Server Admin program should be used exclusively
to manage SNA Administration rights of users.
