</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article contains the complete text of the README.TXT file included
with the Windows 95 Client for Microsoft SNA Server. It describes how to
obtain the files for installing the Windows 95 Client for Microsoft SNA
Server.
<P>
NOTE: The Windows 95 client is included with SNA Server 3.0 and SNA Server
2.11 sp1.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
September 1995
<P>
This note contains information on how to obtain the files for
installing the Windows 95 Client for Microsoft SNA Server.
<P>
A. General Information
<P>
A.1. Obtaining the Windows 95 Client for SNA Server
<P>
The Windows 95 client files are available for downloading in
a self-extracting file, named SNAWIN95.EXE. This self-extracting
file may be found along with the README1.TXT file you are
currently reading. These files have been placed in several
locations for the convenience of our customers. If the files
have become separated and you need to locate the SNAWIN95.EXE
file, see Section C at the end of this file.
<P>
Note that SNAWIN95.EXE is less than 3 megabytes in size
(in a compressed format).
<P>
A.2. Operating system considerations
<P>
The Windows 95 client of SNA Server can be installed on
computers running Microsoft Windows 95 or later.
<P>
For client computers running Microsoft Windows NT Workstation
version 3.51 or later, you can install either the Windows 95
client or the Windows NT client (that was included with SNA Server
versions 2.1 and 2.11), but not both at the same time.
The Windows 95 client is supported by Microsoft SNA Server
version 2.1 or later. The Windows 95 client provides full
support for existing 32-bit SNA Server applications,
using CPIC, APPC, LUA and FMI. Support for 16-bit SNA applications
on Windows 95 is provided by the Win3x client included
with SNA Server versions 2.1 and 2.11.
<P>
A.3. Licensing
<P>
Each Windows 95 client must be properly licensed to access an
SNA Server. Client licensing options on an SNA Server include
Per Seat or Per Server.
<P>
For more information on licensing, see the SNA Server
version 2.11 README.WRI file, Enhancements Guide, and
Planning Guide.
<P>
B. Downloading and Extracting the Files
<P>
The Windows 95 Client for SNA Server can be
installed from a shared network drive,
or from your local drive. To download the
Windows 95 client and prepare the files for
installation, follow these steps:

<OL><P><LI>Create a folder from which to install the
   Windows 95 client files. (Share this folder
   with the appropriate users if you want users
   to install from a shared network drive).

<P><LI>Download SNAWIN95.EXE (see Section C for locations)
   to the folder created in the previous step.

<P><LI>To expand the files, open a command box
   (MS-DOS session), change to the folder where you
   downloaded the SNAWIN95.EXE file, and type
<P>
   snawin95.exe -d
<P>
</OL>This will expand the files for the Windows 95 Client
of SNA Server into the current folder. The -d switch
must be used because it enables the creation of the
appropriate subdirectories. When you issue the preceding
command, a message will popup to remind you to use
the -d switch; it will also provide the option of
cancelling the self-extraction if you did not use
the -d switch.
<P>
For setup instructions, and additional information about
the Windows 95 Client for SNA Server, please see the
README.HLP file that will be copied in Step 3 above to
your local drive in the &lt;snaroot&gt;\system folder.
<P>
A shortcut to the README.HLP file is also created at
the time you run the Setup program, and is called
SNA Client for Windows 95 Release Notes. This icon will be
located on the program menu in the folder created for the
SNA Client for Windows 95. To print all topics in
the Release Notes, select the book icon in the Contents
window and choose the Print button.
<P>
