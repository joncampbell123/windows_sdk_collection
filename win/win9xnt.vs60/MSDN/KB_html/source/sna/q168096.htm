The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server version 3.0 and 3.0 SP1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Windows 95 SNA Server 3.0 client requires one of the following to support 
the Data Encryption feature introduced with SNA Server 3.0:
<P>
<PRE>  Client for Microsoft Networks

</PRE>-or- 
<P>
<PRE>  DCOM for Windows 95

</PRE>If one of these components is not installed, and encryption is enabled for the 
user trying to access the SNA Server, the connection attempt will fail. The 
applets included with SNA Server will return errors similar to the following 
when this occurs.
<P>
5250 Applet:
<P>
<PRE>   There are no SNA Servers running in your domain.

   [F004][010000F0]

</PRE>3270 Applet:
<P>
<PRE>   ERROR - Reading SNA Server Configuration.

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
- The Data Encryption feature of SNA Server 3.0 requires that SNA Server
<PRE>  clients are validated using the NTLM logon process. Third-party network 
  redirectors such as Novell Netware Client 32 which do not provide the NTLM 
  security interface will cause the user logon to fail when encryption is 
  used. 

  The Microsoft Network Client and DCOM for Windows 95 install the necessary
  NTLM security components to allow the user logon to succeed when encryption
  is used.

  DCOM for Windows 95 is a Windows 95 addon that provides support for distributed 
  object computing. For more information on DCOM for Windows 95, please
  refer to the following Microsoft Web Page:

  <B><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/oledev/olemkt/oledcom/dcom95.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/oledev/olemkt/oledcom/dcom95.htm</A></B>

</PRE>- SNA Server 2.x client software does not support encryption. If encryption is 
<PRE>  enabled for any users/groups that are running SNA Server 2.x clients, those 
  clients will not be able to connect to SNA Server.

</PRE>- Encryption can be used over any of the client/server LAN transports supported
<PRE>  by SNA Server.

</PRE>- The Windows 95 user does not need to logon to the Windows NT domain that the 
<PRE>  SNA Server belongs or or to any trusted domain in order to use encryption.

</PRE>- If the Client for Microsoft Networks is not installed, the Windows 95 SNA Server
<PRE>  client needs to be configured so that the "Use Windows NT domain password" option
  is not selected under the Advanced tab in the client configuration. If this 
  option is not selected, the Logon Domain has to be entered to specify which 
  Windows NT Domain will be used to validate the user account. This also applies
  if the Client for Microsoft Networks is installed and a non-Named Pipe transport
  (in other words, TCP/IP or IPX/SPX) is selected for the SNA Server client.
