The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, and 3.0
</UL>

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft SNA Server version 2.x package does not include support for
IBM 3287 host print emulation. However, several third-party companies do
support printer emulation, which are listed in the ISV Companion Product
Catalog that is included with SNA Server.
<P>
SNA Server 3.0 removes the need for a third party emulator by including a
print server. The print server allows 3270 printer emulation to be
configured and maintained centrally, rather than at each client desktop.
For more details on this feature, see the 3.0 product documentation or
http:\\www.microsoft.com\sna.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
To support host print emulation (often referred to as 3287 print emulation)
with SNA Server, a third-party product must be used, because the low-end
3270 emulator included with the product only supports display emulation.
<P>
To run the third-party print emulation package at the server, a 32-bit
Windows host print emulation product must be used. Also, a third-party
emulator could also run on any SNA Server client platform (that is, a
Windows 3.x emulator runs on an SNA Server Windows 3.x client, and so on).
<P>
To support print emulation, the administrator must define 3270 printer LUs
in the SNA Server configuration file (using SNA Admin), and assign these
LUs to an SNA Server user or to a group account where the print emulator
will be running. When users route print data to the printer LU supported by
a printer emulation package, SNA Server routes the host print job to the
print emulator, whether it resides on the server or an SNA Server client
(that is, it does not flow to the 3270 display emulator user who initiated
the host print job).
<P>
Also, note that the Windows 16-bit and 32-bit 3270 applets that are shipped
with SNA Server does include a local screen print capability, where screen
data can be routed to a local printer, or redirected to a network printer.
