<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, version 2.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run an LUA/SLI application on Windows NT, the application stops
responding (hangs) after issuing 32767 SLI_SEND commands. The next SLI_SEND
command is never sent to the Host.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The SLI_SEND hangs because an internal counter in the RUI library is being
incremented for each send, but never being decremented. Because the counter
is a 2 byte integer, it is wrapping to zero after 32,767 sends.
<P>
If the SNA Server RUI library and the server are receiving large inbound
RUs from the host, then the RUI library never decrements its internal send
credit. This can cause two possible errors:

<UL><LI>If the SNA Server does return a credit message after receiving data from
   the RUI library, eventually the RUI library's send credit is incremented
   so much that it becomes zero, causing the RUI library to stop sending
   data because it thinks it has run out of credit.

<LI>If the RUI application is pumping data to the node (for example,
   transferring a file to the host), then it floods the node, because the
   RUI library always believes that it has enough credit.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has updated the files, WINRUI.DLL ,for 16-bit clients, and
WINRUI32.DLL, for 32-bit clients, and ACSRUI.DLL for OS/2 clients to
correct this problem.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT.
This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on
