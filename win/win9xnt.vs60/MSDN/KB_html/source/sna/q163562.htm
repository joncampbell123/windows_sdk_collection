The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11 (and all Service Packs),
   3.0, and 3.0 Service Pack 1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
After logging off of some host applications (such as TSO), a TN3270 display
or printer emulator may be unable to reconnect through the TN3270 server
until the user disconnects and reconnects his or her TN session.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
With some host applications (such as TSO), the host sends Deactivate
Logical Unit (DACTLU) and Activate Logical Unit (ACTLU) request units to
recycle the logical unit (LU) following a user logoff. The TN3270 Server
component disconnects the LU after receiving the DACTLU.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, reconnect the client.
<P>
The TN3270 service and the RUI library have been updated to handle the case
where the host resets an LU by sending a DACTLU followed by an ACTLU.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server
versions 2.11 (and all Service Packs), 3.0, and 3.0 Service Pack 1. 
<P>
This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. 
Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query 
on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the 
spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE>A supported fix for SNA Server version 2.11 is now available, but has 
not been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to s
ystems experiencing this specific problem.  Unless you are severely 
impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait 
for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft 
Product SupportServices for more information.
