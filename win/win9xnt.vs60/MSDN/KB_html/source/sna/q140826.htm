<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A host application, such as TeleView, allows a user at a terminal to make a
connection and then spawn additional sessions on the SNA host. Under normal
conditions, the user may terminate a session with no further incident. In
this case, however, when a user ends even just one session, the rest of the
sessions are terminated. This condition may occur when running the TN3270
Service for Windows NT. The TN3270 Server may also generate the following
error:
<P>
<PRE>   sense data = 081B0000

</PRE>The IBM Systems Network Architecture (SNA) Formats guide provides the
following information regarding this error:
<P>
<PRE>   081B0000
   Receiver in Transmit Mode:
   A race condition exists: a normal-flow request was received while the
   half-duplex contention state was NOT-RECEIVED, or while resources (such
   as buffers) necessary for handling normal-flow data were unavailable.

</PRE>Contrary to the explanation given in the IBM SNA Formats guide, a race
condition does not exist in this case. The error is exhibited in the
following diagnostic tools:

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
After receiving a CLEAR message from the SNA host, the TN3270 Server may
reject the first data response unit (RU) from the SNA host. There are two
issues here, both of which have now been fixed:

<OL><P><LI>When the TN3270 Server receives a CLEAR message from the SNA host, it
   does not reset its internal state which keeps track of whether the
   TN3270 emulator or the host application has permission to send. This
   causes the TN3270 Server to reject the first data message received from
   the SNA host with a sense data = 081B0000, because the TN3270 Server
   assumes that the TN3270 emulator still has the permission to send. The
   TN3270 Server then rejects the next data message from the host. At this
   point, the host application gives up and terminates the session.

<P><LI>When the node receives data from the host application which it believes
   to be out of bracket it passes a message up to a Request Unit Interface
   (RUI) application with the Sense Data Included Indicator (sdi) bit set.
   On receiving this, the RUI application is supposed to send a negative
   response with the sense data which the node passed up to it. The TN3270
   Server, however, was not checking for this bit.
<P>
</OL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has updated the files, TN3NTMSG.DLL and TN3SERVR.EXE, to correct
this problem.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT.
This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on
the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
