<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, version 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1,
   and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
If an invalid XID or an XID already in use is detected by the host when a
dial-up (switched) SDLC connection is being established, the following
error will be recorded in the Event Log under Application. The Event Detail
will report the source SNA IBM SDLC Link. The description might read like
this:
<P>
<PRE>   Event: 182
   Connection failure, code=11
    Cause Data           = 3601 3401 3302 f035
    Link Role           = 00
    Remote Node Type      = 00

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Cause data is a list of the failure causes from the Failure subvector in
the alert. Link role and remote node type are as described in the Link
Connections Subsystem Configuration Data subvector in the alert. A
connection failure can be due to a station outage, rather than a link
outage. If it is due to a station outage--which can be recognized by outage
code values of X'80' or higher--then message #183 will also be logged.
<P>
If this occurs and there are no other configuration issues that could be
causing the link service to fail, this is more than likely the cause of the
failure.
<P>
The SNA Server Reference Guide (Connection failure, code=11) corresponds to
"Data Set Ready (DSR) failure". This occurs when the host drops the link
when the Local Node ID (XID) sent by SNA Server is not recognized or not is
use.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Change the XID to a known XID, or an XID that is confirmed not to be in
use. You can do this by doing the following:

<OL><P><LI>From SNA Server Admin, select the link service you want to change.

<P><LI>Choose Services, and then choose Properties.

<P><LI>In the Connection Properties dialog box, choose Setup.

<P><LI>Change the Local Node ID by choosing the OK button, and then choosing
   the OK button again.

<P><LI>Save this configuration, and then restart SNA Server.
<P></OL>
