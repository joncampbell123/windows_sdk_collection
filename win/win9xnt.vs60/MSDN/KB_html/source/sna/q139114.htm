The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Because IBM host systems and SNA-capable systems use the EBCDIC character
set, an application programmer using the APPC, CPIC or LUA API interfaces
on Windows, Windows 95, Windows NT, MS-DOS, or OS/2 must be able to convert
these characters to/from the ASCII character set. SNA Server supports this
capability using either:

<UL><LI>the Common Service Verb (CSV) CONVERT and GET_CP_CONVERT_TABLE 
   functions
<P>
</UL>-or-

<UL><LI>the SNANLS API function, for Windows NT 4.0 (or later) and Windows 95 
   clients
<P>
</UL>When using the CSV functions for ASCII-EBCDIC character conversion,
various host and PC code page translation tables can be generated and
used to accomodate the language-specific configuration differences of
host and PC systems. For more information about these function calls, 
see the SNA Server APPC Programmer's Guide, Chapter 8 "Common Service 
Verbs". For 2.1/2.11, the APPC Programmer's Guide is included in helpfile
format in &lt;CDROM&gt;\DOCS\HELP\SNA.HLP. For 3.0, it is included in
C:\SNA30gld\SDK\infoview.exe SNA.MVB.
<P>
When using the SNANLS API on Windows NT 4.0 (or later versions), SNANLS uses
the EBCDIC Win32 NLS files delivered as part of the Windows NT 4.0 Language
Pack (see the \LANGPACK subdirectory on the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM).  On
Windows 95 clients, the NLS files included with the SNA Server Windows 95
client are used by the SNANLS API. For more information on the SNANLS API 
and requirements, see the SNA National Language Support section within 
the SNA Server 3.0 "SDK Documentation" online help.  Microsoft recommends
using the SNANLS API for Win32 applications that will be run on Windows NT 
and Windows 95 client machines.
<P>
The remainder of this article describes how to use the Common Service Verb
functions. While the Common Service Verb functions are documented in the
APPC Programmer's Guide, they can also be used from a CPIC or LUA application.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following steps should be used to determine what SNA Server Common
Service Verb (CSV) calls should be used by the application programmer:

<OL><P><LI>Determine conversion requirements
<P>
   The CONVERT API call supports ASCII-to-EBCDIC and EBCDIC-to-ASCII
   conversion of characters. The following character set (char_set)
   table options are supported by the CONVERT call:
<P>
<PRE>      char_set   Description
      --------   -----------------------------------------------------
      SV_A      Only the following characters are converted:

                   $ # @ A-Z 0-9

      SV_AE     Only the following characters are converted:

                   . $ # @ a-z A-Z 0-9

      SV_G      SNA Server uses a user-defined type G conversion
                table for character conversion. See below for more
                information about type G conversion table.

   See Appendix A of the IBM SNA Formats Guide (IBM doc #GA27-3136) for
   a description of the A and AE character sets.   For SV_A and SV_AE
   conversions, trailing blanks (that is, blanks at the end of the source
   string) are converted to blanks in either direction.  In contrast,
   embedded blanks are converted to 0x00 (NULL).  If any source character
   is converted to 0x00, the CONVERSION_ERROR secondary return_code is
   returned, though the conversion will still be completed.

   Type G conversion table
   -----------------------
   The Type G conversion table is user-defined.  SNA Server ships with
   a default type G conversion table called COMTBLG.DAT. This conversion
   table is automatically installed on SNA Server Windows NT and
   SNA Server Windows 95 client machines, to &lt;snaroot&gt;\SYSTEM\COMTBLG.DAT.
   Here is how to enable the this type G conversion table on the other
   client platforms:

      On Windows 3.x, copy the COMTBLG.DAT file to the client machine
      and add a COMTBLG entry to the [wnap] section of WIN.INI to point
      to this file. For example:

        COMTBLG=C:\SNA.WIN\COMTBLG.DAT

      The COMTBLG.DAT conversion table is composed of 32 lines of 32
      characters each.  Each line represents 16 printable hexadecimal
      characters followed by a carriage return and line feed.  The first
      16 lines provide ASCII-to-EBCDIC conversion information while the
      second 16 lines provide EBCDIC-to-ASCII conversion information.

   When SNA Server performs the conversion, it uses the numeric
   equivalent of each incoming character as a 0-origin index into
   the conversion table. This index specifies the table location
   containing the hexadecimal value of the converted character.
   For example, assume that the 32nd position in the table
   contained 0x40. SNA Server would convert an incoming character
   with a value of 32 to a value of 64 (0x40).

</PRE><P><LI>If the above conversion tables are insufficient, a custom conversion
   table must be generated.
<P>
   The GET_CP_CONVERT_TABLE function supports the generation of a custom
   conversion table which can then be used to create a custom conversion
   table to replace the COMTBLG.DAT file shipped with SNA Server.
   The application programmer passes the desired source code page
   (source_cp) and target code page (target_cp), and receives the desired
   256-byte conversion table. These conversion tables can be concatenated
   together to form a custom &lt;snaroot&gt;\system\COMTBLG.DAT file to replace
   the version included with SNA Server. This conversion table can then be
   used when calling the CONVERT function when the SV_G conversion table
   option is specified.
<P>
   The GET_CP_CONVERT_TABLE function supports the following source and
   target code pages:
<P>
<PRE>         ASCII code pages (also referred to as PC Character Sets)

<P>
   If the above conversion tables are not sufficient, a user-written
   conversion table must be defined, or a custom character conversion
   routine must be implemented by the application programmer.
