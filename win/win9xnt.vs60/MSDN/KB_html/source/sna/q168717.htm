<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, version 2.0, 2.1, 2.11 (all
   Service Packs), 3.0, 3.0 SP1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Users with active 3270 or LU6.2 sessions through SNA Server may
unexpectedly observe degraded host or AS/400 response time. This problem
can occur when new users attempt to open sessions to SNA Server and a
domain controller (or trusted domain controller) from the user's domain
is unavailable to process user logon requests.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When a new user connects to SNA Server, the SNA Server logs the user on
to Windows NT, causing Windows NT to perform user logon validation against
a domain controller in the user's domain. If the domain controller cannot
be reached (for example, due to a transient network problem), currently
connected clients can experience intermittent response time delays.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Identify and correct the underlying cause of the slow or failed
   access to the trusted domain controllers.
<P>
</UL>-OR-

<UL><LI>Break the Windows NT trust relationship with these trusted user domains,
   and configure the SNA Server clients to connect to the SNA Server
   computers using the Windows NT Guest account. This is only an option if
   all SNA clients have the same access requirements. For example, if all
   users are accessing the same 3270 LU pooled resources, or there is no
   defaulting of APPC LU's to users or groups. If this workaround is used,
   note that the Guest account is disabled by default within Windows NT
   User Manager, and must be manually enabled. Even though the Guest
   account is enabled, access to any Windows NT resources can still be
   prevented for guests, to allow access for SNA Server client use only.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 2.11 (all
service packs), 3.0 and 3.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1).
<P>
This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. 
Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query 
on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the 
spaces):

<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
A fix to SNA Server 3.0 (post Service Pack 1) is available to correct
this problem. With this fix applied, the SNA Server no longer handles
client logon requests within an SNA Server DMOD critical section, and now
processes logons asynchronously via other process threads.
