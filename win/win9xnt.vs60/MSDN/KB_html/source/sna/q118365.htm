The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, version 2.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The Microsoft SNA Server version 2.0 package supports Logical Unit (LU)
types 1 and 3, though it does not include a host print emulator. However,
several third-party companies do support print emulation that works through
SNA Server; these products are listed in the Companion Product Catalog
included with the SNA Server product. This article describes how host print
data flows through SNA Server when these third-party products are being
used.
<P>
NOTE: The latest companion product catalog can be found or on the Microsoft
Internet server (ftp.microsoft.com) under the BUSSYS/SNASRVR/DOCS
directory.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Before describing how host print data flows between the host, SNA Server,
and print emulator, the following components must be configured:

<UL><LI>VTAM (host) is configured with printer Logical Units (LU) off a physical
   unit (PU) definition. Also, users are defined at the host to have access
   to print host application data/files to this printer LU.

<LI>SNA Server is configured with a connection to the host, emulating this
   PU and 3270 LUs (including a printer LU). A local area network (LAN)-
   based user is assigned access to the printer LU in the SNA Server Admin
   program.

<LI>A third-party print emulator is run under the user context of the LAN
   user who has been assigned access to the printer LU. Also, the third-
   party emulator is configured to route the print data to a PC printer
   (for example, LPT1, or redirected LPT1 to a Windows NT print queue,
   which may be configured to print to a LAN-attached printer through
   Windows NT Print Manager).
<P>
</UL>Here's how the host print data flows:

<UL><LI>A host user, using his host application on a 3270 terminal (or 3270
   emulator), sends a host print job to the printer LU.

<LI>The host sends the print data to the printer LU, which flows to SNA
   Server over the SNA Server link. SNA Server then sends the data to the
   third-party print emulator (which is emulating a host printer -- the
   third-party emulator already has activated the printer LU session). The
   print emulator may be running on the same computer as SNA Server, or on
   any SNA Server client computer that is communicating through the server
   (over any client/server LAN connection type supported by SNA Server).

<LI>The third-party host print emulator converts the host print data (and
   performs any additional formatting, as supported by the emulator), and
   sends the data to the PC print destination (that is, redirected LPT1
   port). Using print redirection, this printer destination can be a
   Windows NT print queue, as supported by the underlying network software.

<LI>The Windows NT print queue sends the print job to the printer, which can
   be a network-attached printer as supported by Windows NT Print Manager.
