<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you dynamically load and unload the WINRUI32.DLL, your computer hangs.
This symptom occurs sporadically.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This problem occurs during a call to FreeLibrary (hLibModule) where
hLibModule was previously set to the result of a call to LoadLibrary
(WINRUI32.DLL).
<P>
The hang occurs when the WINRUI32.DLL is unloaded by the FreeLibrary()call.
The hang is caused by WINRUI32.DLL trying to remove its DMOD routing
procedure during DLL detach processing. There are certain procedures that
cannot be reliable performed inside detach processing, for example, waiting
for something like the DMOD routing proc table to become available.
<P>
Existing applications that do not call WinRUIStartup/WinRUICleanup continue
to function as before.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has updated the file LIBS\WIN32WINRUI32.DLL to correct this
problem.
<P>
The fix to the WINRUI32.DLL removes the RUI routing procedure during the
processing of the WinRUICleanup() call and ensures that the DLL detach
processing does not attempt to do it again. To properly load and unload the
DLL you need to always call WinRUIStartup before your first RUI verb and
WinRUICleanup before freeing the WINRUI32.DLL.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT.
This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on
