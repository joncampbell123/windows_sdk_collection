<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
APPC is a peer-oriented program-to-program API where either Transaction
Program (TP) can initiate a conversation. However, APPC/LU6.2 traditionally
is half-duplex, where after the conversation is established, only one TP
has direction to send on a conversation at a time. The state of the
conversation, as viewed by a particular TP, governs which APPC verbs can be
issued by the TP at a particular time. If the local TP views the
conversation as being in a "send" state, then the partner TP would also be
in a send state.
<P>
IBM now supports "full duplex" APPC where either program can issue both
send and receive verbs at the same time, though this is a fairly new
implementation of APPC.
<P>
The following is the option to set for full duplex functionality:
<P>
<PRE>   112 -- Full-duplex conversations and expedited data

</PRE>SNA Server does not support option set 112; it only supports half-duplex,
although either end can initiate the conversation.
<P>

<P>
See the "Conversation States" section of Chapter 2 of the SNA Server
Programmer's Reference for a thorough explanation of conversation state
changes.
