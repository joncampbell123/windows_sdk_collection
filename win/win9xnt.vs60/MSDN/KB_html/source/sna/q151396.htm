The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and 3.51
<LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, and
   2.11 Service Pack 1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In certain instances, when you activate an SNA Server SDLC or X.25
connection on an IBM PS/2 computer configured with an IBM MPA/A (or the
Microgate equivalent), the computer freezes and fails to respond to
keyboard or mouse input.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There are two problems which cause this problem to occur:

<UL><LI>The IBM PS/2 abios disk controller tries to allocate all available
   map registers for large data transfers. The standard SDLC device driver
   allocates 2 when the SDLC connection is activated and never releases
   them.
<P>
   The disk controller hangs while waiting for the map registers. Slowly
   the whole system hangs as paging and disk access are stopped.

<LI>The IBM PS/2 abios disk controller performs DMA data transfers at
   interrupt processor level. Microsoft Windows NT defines this as
   illegal (this may work on a single processor architecture, but in a
   multiprocessor environment it is dangerous, so Windows NT disallows it).
   The SDLC driver allocates a DMA resource, the disk controller generates
   an interrupt, and tries to acquire this DMA resource, and cannot, and
   never will be able to (the disk controller has just locked out the
   driver that owns it permanently). This causes the system to lock solid.
<P>
</UL><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Both problems are solved by applying the alternate Ibmsync.sys driver
(intended for PS/2 computers using the IBM MPA/A adapter or Microgate
Microchannel equivalent), described below. If the default Ibmsync.sys
driver is used, the first problem is solved through the support of a
special DontUseMappedRegisters registry setting for the IBMSYNC driver.
<P>
As documented in the SNA Server 2.11 Release Notes (Readme.wri), a special
version of the Ibmsync.sys driver supplied on the SNA Server 2.11 compact
disc can also be used to solve hang problems that may occur on IBM PS/2
computers. To replace the existing driver, start the Windows NT Command
Prompt and enter the following commands:
<P>
<PRE>  cd &lt;snaroot&gt;\system
  rename ibmsync.sys ibmsync.211
  copy &lt;sna_cdrom&gt;:\i386\system\hwsetup\ibmsdlc\ibmsync._sy  ibmsync.sys
  cd hwsetup\ibmsdlc
  rename ibmsync.sys ibmsync.211
  copy &lt;sna_cdrom&gt;:\i386\system\hwsetup\ibmsdlc\ibmsync._sy ibmsync.sys

</PRE>NOTE: The Release Notes document the driver name as ibmsync._ys, though
the actual file name shipped on the SNA Server CD-ROM is ibmsync._sy.
<P>
Using the default Ibmsync.sys driver, the following registry setting causes
the driver to not request the use of mapped registers (though this version
of the driver does not correct the other hang problem observed with PS/2
computers).
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.
<P>
Open Regedt32.exe and locate the following key in the system registry:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/IBMSYNC/Parameters

   DontUseMapRegisters: REG_DWORD: 1

</PRE>Once this option is configured, the SNA Server service must be restarted.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
If problems persist with the SDLC connection, a special traced version of
Ibmsync.sys is included on the SNA Server 2.11 compact disc that logs
additional failure conditions to the Windows NT system event log.
<P>
To apply the traced driver, start the Windows NT Command Prompt and enter
the following commands:
<P>
<PRE>  cd &lt;snaroot&gt;\system
  rename ibmsync.sys ibmsync.211
  copy &lt;sna_cdrom&gt;:\i386\system\hwsetup\ibmsdlc\debug\ibmsync.sys
</PRE>ibmsync.sys
<P>
This special version of the driver logs internal driver errors when
sending/receiving information to/from the IBM SDLC/MPAA or Microgate
adapter. These new errors are logged in the Windows NT system event log as
event 33 or 34.
