The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11 and 2.11 SP1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Terminating a 3270 session abruptly may result in a situation where a new
VTAM or host signon screen is not sent to the 3270 session. This problem
was observed in one case where a 3270 session was ended by pressing the
SYSREQ key.
<P>
When this problem occurs, SNA Server may log the following message in the
Windows NT Application Event log:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 21
   Source: SNA Server
   Description: X'1124' Negative Response Sent on Connection &lt;connection
   name&gt;
               (SENSE = 0815)

</PRE>This problem does not occur in SNA Server 3.0.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Normally, a Host is not entitled to send a BIND request for a new session
until it receives an UNBIND response. However, when a host sends an UNBIND
Type '0x0F' (UNBIND Cleanup) or any UNBIND type in the range of '0x07' to
<PRE>'0x7F,' it is allowed to reset its half-session immediately. If the UNBIND
</PRE>is one of these types, the host can send a BIND request before it receives
the UNBIND response.
<P>
SNA Server is not able to handle the receipt of a BIND request for a
session before it has sent an UNBIND response for that session. Therefore,
SNA Server rejects the new BIND request with a BIND -RSP because it has not
yet received a response from the emulator to the Close(PLU) request that
generates the UNBIND response that will be sent to the host.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
There are no current workarounds for SNA Server versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, or
2.11 SP1. A 2.11 SP1 hotfix is under investigation.
<P>
This problem does not occur with SNA Server 3.0.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.0,
2.1, 2.11, and 2.11 SP1.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

</PRE><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Sense Data section of the IBM SNA Formats Guide (GA27-3136) describes
Sense Code 0815xxxx as:
<P>
<PRE>   Function Active: A request to activate a network element or procedure
   was received, but the element or procedure was already active.

   Bytes 2 and 3 following the sense code contain sense code specific
   information.
