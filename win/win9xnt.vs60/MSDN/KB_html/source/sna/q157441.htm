<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11,
   2.11 Service Pack 1, and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you try to enter the TSO area of a mainframe, you will receive an
error message, and when you examine the Application log, the log will show
that a BIND negative Response was sent on the connection:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 21
   Description: BIND Negative Response Sent on Connection XXXX
   (SENSE=08350001)

</PRE>The sense code will be 08350001 in every instance, if this is the problem.
If the sense code value does not match, the information in this article
will not apply.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The channel adapter link service is providing PU 2.0 node capabilities,
even though SNA Server thinks that it is operating at PU 2.1 node
capabilities. The host will set a value greater than one in the OAF
(Origination Address Field), which in a PU 2.1 is reserved for independent
LU 6.2:

</PRE>Notice that byte one (byte 0 is 0x31 in the Element data) of the BIND is
set to 0x01, which implies a value of nonnegotiable according to the IBM
SNA Formats. However, the only value allowed for LU 6.2 is 0x00 that
implies a value of negotiable. SNA Server, as any other PU 2.1, is
interpreting this BIND as if it was for an LU 6.2; therefore, it rejects
the BIND on the basis that byte 1 should be set to negotiable:

</PRE>The above frames were taken from a Data Link Control trace of the SNA
Server Service.  To enable this tracing do the following:
<P>
For SNA Server 2.x:

<OL><P><LI>Run the SNA Server trace utility on the SNA Server and click the
   Clear All button.

<P><LI>Verify that no files exist in the &lt;SNA Root&gt;\traces directory. Move
   any files to another directory.

<P><LI>Select SNA Server from the pull down list box labeled Service Name.

<P><LI>Select the Data Link Control checkbox from the message traces group.

<P><LI>Click the Apply button, and recreate the situation.

<P><LI>After the problem appears, switch to the SNA Server trace
   application and click the Clear All button.
<P>
</OL>For SNA Server 3.x:

<OL><P><LI>Run the SNA Server trace utility on the SNA Server and click the
   Clear All Traces button.

<P><LI>Verify that no files exist in the &lt;SNA Root&gt;\traces directory. Move
   any files to another directory.

<P><LI>Select SNA Server from the Trace Items tab and then select Properties
   button.

<P><LI>Select the Message Trace tab, and then select Data Link Control check
   box.

<P><LI>Click the Apply button, and recreate the situation.

<P><LI>After the problem appears, switch to the SNA Server trace
   application and click the Clear All Traces button.
<P>
   The file(s) in the &lt;SNA Root&gt;\traces should contain a DLC trace of
   what transpired from the point in time that Apply was selected to the
   point in time that Clear All was selected. If you experience the problem
   described in this article, you should see the frames presented above.
<P>
</OL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
A hotfix to SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 1 SNACFG.DLL is available to
enable the SNA Server to indicate whether PU 2.0 or PU 2.1 should be
used by a channel link service.
<P>
Also, SNA Server now indicates the correct XID type if Format 0 XID is
configured on the connection.
<P>
This hotfix will be included in an upcoming SNA Server 2.11 service
pack. This update is already included in SNA Server 3.0.
<P>
If SNA Server 2.11 is being used and this hotfix isn't applied, versions of
VTAM that can support independent LU6.2 can resolve this problem by adding
the following parameter to the VTAM PU definition:
<P>
<PRE>   XID=YES

</PRE></OL>Versions of VTAM that can support independent LU 6.2 can resolve the
problem by adding the following parameter to the VTAM PU definition:
<P>
<PRE>   XID=YES

</PRE>This would allow both systems to negotiate the same type of node, providing
for propriety in the parameters sent to and from the host. However, VTAM
3.11 does not support independent LU 6.2; therefore, the node type cannot
be forced to be a PU 2.1. A Program Temporary Fix (PTF) is available from
IBM to correct this problem. Contact IBM for more information on the PTF.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 2.11 and 2.11
Service Pack 1.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
