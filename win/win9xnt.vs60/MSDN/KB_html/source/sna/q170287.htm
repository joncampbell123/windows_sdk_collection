<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11 and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If an SLI program opens multiple sessions, the application may fail to
receive error notification on all sessions if a link failure occurs,
causing the session to stop responding. This problem was observed in the
following scenario:

<UL><LI>A Win32-based SLI application (running on the SNA Server or a
   Windows NT client) opens 100 sessions, then calls SLI_RECEIVE on
   each session.

<LI>A connection failure occurs, causing all 100 sessions to fail.  However,
   the SLI application fails to receive any error notification on most of
   the sessions. All SLI_RECEIVEs should return with the following error
   message when the connection fails:
<P>
<PRE>      primary_rc   = 0x000F     (LUA_SESSION_FAILURE)
      secondary_rc = 0x08310000 (LUA_LU_COMPONENT_DISCONNECTED)

</PRE></UL>The above scenario describes the common symptom for this problem.
However, the problem could appear whenever the SLI library receives
status or data messages on a large number of sessions at the same time.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The SNA Server SLI interface is queuing messages to the RUI interface
incorrectly, which could cause outstanding SLI calls to fail to return
to the SLI application.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.11
SP2 and 3.0 SP1.
<P>
This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. 
Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on 
the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
<P>
<PRE>   S E R V P A C K

</PRE>A supported fix is now available for 2.11 SP2, but has not been fully 
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing
this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific
problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that
contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more
information.
