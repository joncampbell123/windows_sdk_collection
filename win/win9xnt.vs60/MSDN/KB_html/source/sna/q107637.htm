<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 
   and 3.0 SP1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you attempt to start a 3270 or 5250 session from a Windows NT RAS
client (or from a Windows NT computer which was rebooted without being
initially connected to a network), the emulator does not start and the
following error occurs:
<P>
<PRE>  ERROR - The SnaBase service is not started.

</PRE>Also, once SnaBase is started, the Windows NT user must still be authorized
to open a network session to the Windows NT server where SNA Server is
running, or the SNA session cannot connect. If this occurs, the 3270 applet
displays "No SNA Server found in domain", while the 5250 applet displays
error F004 (Comm_Subsystem_Not_Loaded).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When Windows NT starts up, the SnaBase service is configured to autostart.
However, if SnaBase cannot initially connect to an SNA Server, SnaBase
stops before the user can establish the RAS connection.
<P>
If an administrator logs into the computer and the 3270 emulator is
started, the SnaBase service is autostarted. However, if a user logs into
the computer, the user does not have authority to start a Windows NT
service (for example, SnaBase service), so this error occurs.
<P>
Also, once SnaBase is started, the user must still have authority to open a
network session to the Windows NT computer where SNA Server is running. If
a user account exists on the Windows NT computer, the local user password
must match the Windows NT domain user password or access is denied.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
An SNA Server 2.11 update is available to correct this problem. Microsoft
has updated the following Windows NT client files to correct this problem:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;snaroot&gt;\SYSTEM\SNABASE.EXE
   &lt;snaroot&gt;\SYSTEM\SNADMOD.DLL

</PRE>With this update applied, SnaBase does not terminate if you add the
following registry Value under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree under the
following subkey:
<P>
<PRE>   /SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/SnaBase/  Parameters/

   Value Name: TerminateIfNoSponsors
   Data Type:  REG_DWORD
   Data: 0

</PRE>If this entry is not present, or is set to 1, then SnaBase terminates if it
cannot open the sponsor connection.
<P>
Without applying this update, it is possible to work around this problem
by assigning the following rights to local users so that they have
authority to start SnaBase:

<UL><LI>For Windows NT Workstation, the local user must be a member of the
   "Power Users" group.

<LI>For Windows NT Servers, the local user must be a member of the
   "Server Operators" group.
<P>
</UL>Also, once the SnaBase service is started, the Windows NT user must
still have authority to open a network session to the Windows NT computer
where the SNA Server is running. When connecting over RAS, a Windows NT
user must initially login to the computer using a local user account.
When attempting to get a session to the SNA Server, the local user
credentials are used to connect to the Windows NT computer where SNA Server
is running.
<P>
If the user passwords are not synchronized, and if the SNA client is
connecting to the server over named pipes, the user can still gain access
to the SNA Server by preestablishing a network session to the server before
starting their SNA application. To do this, the user can issue the
following command:
<P>
<PRE>   net use \\&lt;server_name&gt;\ipc$ /user:&lt;domain&gt;\&lt;user_name&gt; *

</PRE>where &lt;server_name&gt; is the SNA Server, &lt;domain&gt; is the Windows NT domain,
&lt;user_name&gt; is the Windows NT user name, and * causes the prompt for the
user's Windows NT password.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT.
This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on
