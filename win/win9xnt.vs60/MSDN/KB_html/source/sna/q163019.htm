The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11 Service Pack 1 and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Under certain conditions, an LUA session may terminate unexpectedly with
the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 1954
   Source:   SNA RUI Application
   Description: RUI internal logic error for LU &lt;name&gt;, code &lt;value&gt;

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When the SNA Server service informs the RUI library that a Path
Information Unit (PIU) has not been sent due to some problem (such as a
bracket error), the RUI library terminates the RUI session. RUI internal
logical error 1954 is logged in the application Event Log.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
A fix is available to correct this problem.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server
versions 2.11 Service Pack 1 and 3.0.
A supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The RUI library posts RUI_WRITE as complete once it has passed the data to
the SNA Server service, instead of waiting for the SNA Server service to
actually process the data. In this situation, it is possible that the PIU
has not yet been sent. For example, this may be the case due to a race
condition with the host application. When the SNA Server service informs
the RUI library that the PIU has not been sent, the RUI library terminates
the RUI session because it was already informed that the RUI_WRITE was
completed successfully.
