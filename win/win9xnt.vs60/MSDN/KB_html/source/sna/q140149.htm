The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The 802.2 connection icon shown in SNA Server Admin may not indicate
the correct network type.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Each SNA Server connection name is preceded by an icon that indicates what
type of connection it is. 802.2 connections are shown with one of the
following icons types:
<P>
<PRE>   Icon Type      802.2 Connection
   -------------------------------
   Icon           Network Type

   Ring           Token Ring, FDDI

   T-shaped Tap   Ethernet

</PRE>Following are two scenarios that can lead to SNA Server Admin displaying
the wrong icon for an 802.2 connection.
<P>
<P><h3>Incorrect Media Type Entry in NT Registry</h3>
 
<P>
SNA Server Setup reads the installed network adapter's MediaType parameter
from the Registry to indicate the media type of the 802.2 link. This value
is passed to the SNA Server Admin program so that it can display the
connection icon for the 802.2 connection.
<P>
If the MediaType parameter indicates the wrong type of media, SNA Server
Admin will display the wrong 802.2 connection icon. In this case, this is
just a cosmetic problem that does not inhibit SNA Server's functionality.
<P>
There are two workarounds to this problem:
<P>
WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

<UL><LI>Before you run SNA Server Setup to install an 802.2 DLC link service,
   run REGEDT32 and modify the following registry setting:
<P>
   1. Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/CurrentControlSet/Services/
<P><PRE>      AdapterName/Parameters/MediaType.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      Note: AdapterName is the name of the Network Adapter installed in
      Windows NT.
</PRE><P>
<P><PRE>      For example, a single Intel EtherExpress 16 is called "EE161."
</PRE><P>
   2. Change MediaType so that is reflects the correct Media Type.
<P>
<PRE>         Network      MediaType
         ----------------------
         Ethernet        1
         Token Ring      2
         FDDI            3

   SNA Server Setup properly detects the network adapter's media type and
   SNA Server Admin displays the correct icon.

   -or-

</PRE><LI>If the SNA Server configuration file already includes an 802.2
   connection that shows the incorrect icon, follow these steps:
<P>
   1. Using SNA Server Admin, delete any incorrect 802.2 connections from
<P><PRE>      the configuration file.
</PRE><P>
   2. Using REGEDT32, modify the following registry setting:
<P>
<P><PRE>      a. Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/CurrentControlSet/Services/
<PRE></PRE>         &lt;SNADLC1&gt;/Parameters/ExtraParameters/MACType.

      b. Change MACType to reflect the correct media type as listed above.
         (where &lt;SNADLC1&gt; is the name of the 802.2 link service
         specified during SNA Server setup).

      c. Rerun SNA Admin, add a new 802.2 connection, which now appears
         with the correct connection icon.

</PRE></UL><h3>Multiple Network Adapters Installed in NT Server</h3>
 
<P>
If SNA Server is installed on a Windows NT Server that has multiple network
adapters installed (multi-homed), it is possible that the 802.2 DLC Link
Service installed during SNA Server Setup was configured to use the wrong
adapter. In this case, it is possible that this is more than a cosmetic
problem. A usual symptom when this problem occurs is that whenever the SNA
Server configuration is saved and SNA Server Admin is restarted, the 802.2
connection with the incorrect icon shows a Link Service of (None) when
Connection Properties are viewed. Under normal circumstances, the Link
Service would show SnaDlc1 (assuming the first 802.2 Link Service installed
was having the problem).
<P>
The following procedure explains how to correct this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Stop the SNA Server and exit SNA Server Admin.

<P><LI>Run SNA Server Setup and remove the 802.2 DLC Link Service that is
   displaying the wrong icon.

<P><LI>Exit SNA Server Setup.

<P><LI>Run SNA Server Admin. Admin will display a popup message indicating that
   SnaDlc1 (assuming the removed link service is called SnaDlc1) is being
   removed. Choose the OK button.

<P><LI>After the link service is removed by Admin, save the configuration
   (Select Save Configuration from the File menu).

<P><LI>Exit SNA Server Admin.

<P><LI>Run SNA Server Setup and re-install the 802.2 DLC Link Service. Verify
   that the proper network adapter is selected for the link service.

<P><LI>Exit Setup.

<P><LI>Run SNA Server Admin.

<P><LI>A new connection is now listed under the SNA Server name that should
<P><PRE>    show the proper icon. You can configure this new connection or you can
    go into Connection Properties for the existing connection and select
    the SnaDlc link service that was just installed. You can delete the
    connection that you are not going to use.
