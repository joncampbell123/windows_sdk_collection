The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Using SNA Manager, it's not possible to determine which specific 3270
LUs have been assigned to users and which have not been assigned. This
makes it difficult to avoid assignment of the same 3270 LU to multiple
users.
<P>
NOTE: This problem only applies to assignment of specific 3270 LUs to
users. If a pooled 3270 LU is assigned to a user or group, the user
automatically accesses the next available 3270 LU from the pool, so
conflicts do not occur.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There is no mechanism in SNA Manager to identify 3270 LUs which have not
been assigned to users.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
An update to SNA Server 3.0 is available to correct this problem. The
update adds a new Assigned To column in SNA Server Manager for 3270 LUs.
This option is selected by default, causing the Assigned To column to
appear in any SNA Manager window where 3270 LUs are displayed.
<P>
To customize which columns should be displayed by SNA Server Manager, focus
on the connection status and click View/Columns.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
