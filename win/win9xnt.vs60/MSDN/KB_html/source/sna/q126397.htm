The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, and
   3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article covers the implications of installing SNA Server on a primary
domain controller/backup domain controller rather than a member server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
SNA Server logs users on to the Windows NT domain before allowing any
requests to be processed, regardless of the transport used by the client to
connect to SNA Server. If SNA Server logs users onto the domain over named
pipes, the users is not prompted for the domain password or username. For
other client server protocols (IPX/SPX, TCP/IP, Banyan, and AppleTalk), the
user is prompted for the domain password and username. As a result, each
new client connection to SNA Server results in a winlogon transaction
which, in the case of a member server, needs to be authenticated across the
network by a PDC or BDC. A Windows NT member server does not maintain the
domain user database, and therefore must rely on a BDC or PDC to validate
the user over a secure channel.
<P>
If the PDC or BDC spend a large percentage of CPU time servicing winlogon
requests, and the clients generally stay connected to SNA Servers for a
long time, then the administrator should install SNA Server on a member
server. If clients connect and disconnect frequently from SNA Server, and
the Windows NT domain is primarily used for SNA access (as is likely the
case when you install in an existing NetWare or Banyan environment), you
should install SNA Server on the PDC or BDC.
<P>
<P><h3>SNA Server to SNA Server Communication Issue:</h3>
 

<OL><P><LI>SNA Server Versions 2.11 SP1 and earlier:
<P>
   If SNA Servers in the same domain are located across routers, an
   administrator must install SNA Server on a primary domain controller
   (PDC) or backup domain controller (BDC). SNA Server to SNA Server
   communication is mailslot or datagram based. SNA Server uses the
   winlogon protocols when sending messages across routers.

<P><LI>SNA Server 3.0:
<P>
   SNA Server 3.0 systems in the same domain that are separated
   by routers do not have to be installed on Windows NT domain controllers.
   SNA Server 3.0 Setup will prompt for the primary SNA Server's name if it
   is unable to dynamically locate the primary SNA Server based on a UDP
   broadcast datagram.
