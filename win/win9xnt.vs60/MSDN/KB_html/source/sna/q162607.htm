The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11 and 2.11 SP1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
In a case where two or more 16-bit LUA applications are using the thunked
LUA library, the library no longer processes any LUA verbs once the first
application to start is closed (where WinSliCleanup() or WinRuiCleanup()
was issued).
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This is because the thunked library creates a window for processing
asynchronous messages in the first API call, and when the first application
is closed, that window is closed. However, all asynchronous notification
messages are still sent to that (now non-existent) window handle.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Apply the fix referenced below.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.11
and 2.11 Service Pack 1 (SP1).
A supported fix is now available for SNA Server 2.11 SP1, but has not been
fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing
this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific
problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that
contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more
information.
