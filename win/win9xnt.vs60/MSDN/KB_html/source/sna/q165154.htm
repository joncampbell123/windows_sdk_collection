<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
A 3270 print session defined for the SNA Server 3.0 Host Print Service may
stay in a spooling state after a host print job is sent to the printer. The
result of this is that the print job does not finish printing completely.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The credit mechanism used by the FMI interface to provide flow control
between SNA Server and an application (to prevent the application from
exhausting its resources) does not correctly handle a BID message. A BID
message received from the host is counted for pacing purposes, but not for
credit purposes. The default credit algorithm fails to send a credit
message from the Print Server service to the SNA Server service. Because
the SNA Server service did not receive a credit message, it cannot send a
pacing response to the host. This causes the host to stop sending data to
SNA Server for the print session, causing the print session to remain in a
spooling state. Therefore, the print job does not finish printing.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below. With the
hotfix, the 3270 Print Provider has been updated to correct this problem.
This update allows a single credit message to be sent to the SNA Server
service for all data messages it receives. The updated module is:
<P>
<PRE>   &lt;Snaroot&gt;\System\3270ppd.dll

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
