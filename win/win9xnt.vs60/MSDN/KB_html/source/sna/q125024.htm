Support BBS number at (206) 649-6660.

<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The correct driver must be used for the appropriate adapter. The following
self-extracting files are available on the Attachmate BBS:
<P>
<PRE>  SDLCNT21.EXE : Attachmate SDLC driver, for SNA Server 2.1

  ADSDLC21.EXE : Attachmate Advanced SDLC driver, for SNA Server 2.1

</PRE>Once these files are extracted, they may be installed through SNA Server
Setup by choosing the Add Link Service option and choosing the Other button
which prompts for the location of the third-party driver setup files.
<P>
The Attachmate SDLC adapter is a 1/2-length card and has a switch pack with
only 5 dip switches on it. The Attachmate Advanced SDLC adapter is a 2/3-
length card and has 8 dip switches on the switch pack.
<P>

independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
