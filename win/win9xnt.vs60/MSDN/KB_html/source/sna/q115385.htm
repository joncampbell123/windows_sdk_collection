<P>
Bugs fixed:
<P>
<P>
1780  Some MCA-bus machines may hang when activating SDLC
<P>
When using the IBM Multiprotocol (MCA-bus SDLC) Adapter,
certain machines may hang when activating an SNA Server
SDLC connection.  This hang has been observed on an IBM
PS/2 Model 95 and NCR 3410.  When using an IBM Model 95,
this fix should be applied and the SDLC_1 arbitration level
setting for the adapter (set using the reference diskette)
should be set to 0.
<P>
<P>
1928  SDLC connection may drop unexpectedly.
<P>
Fix reliability problems which could cause the SDLC connection
to drop unexpectedly.  Under heavy stress, the link service
was receiving SDLC data which it believed to be invalid, causing
the connection to be dropped. This update corrects a problem in
the way the link service was accepting data from the adapter.
<P>
<P>
2184  SNALINK service exception using DCA ISCA adapter
<P>
If an SDLC device driver returned an error to the link service,
SNALINK treated this as a fatal error leading to an Int 3 (causing
an application exception).  Instead, such a condition is now
considered to be recoverable, so an outage will be logged in the
application event log and processing will continue.
<P>
<P>
1665  Fix to allow 2nd MPAA adapter (MPAA2) to work
<P>
When using the IBM Multiprotocol adapter (MCA-bus SDLC card),
SNA Server would only support the first adapter (MPAA1) in the
machine.  With this fix, SNA Server now supports both adapters.
<P>
<P>
XXXX  Fix to allow ibmsdlc/ibmx25 to run on Windows NT 3.5.
<P>
Due to a change in Windows NT 3.5 (codename Daytona), the SNA
Server 2.0 ibmsdlc and ibmx25 link services do not initialize
properly, causing these links to fail.
<P>
1580  SDLC performs excessive logging on failure conditions.
<P>
Certain errors (such as ibmsync initialization failures and
some SDLC link service outages) were causing multiple errors to
be reported to the server, and to the event log.
<P>
<P>
1986  Relax X.25 negotiation timer when SNA Server is primary (patch 31)
<P>
When SNA Server is primary on an X.25 connection, turn off the
timer when receiving an open station, allowing a QSNRM to always
be transmitted.
<P>
<P>
1983  Support Microgate SDLC adapter at 56KB (Patch 28)
<P>
The SNA Server IBM SDLC device driver now supports the Microgate
SDLC adapters (models USA, MG96, MG144 and DSA, for both ISA-bus
and Microchannel bus).  Tested at speeds up to 56KB.  This adapter
is compatible with the IBM SDLC/MPAA adapter.
<P>
<P>
1738  IBM X.25 link service does not accept 8 character device name
<PRE>      (Patch #4)

</PRE>Any SDLC device driver which exports an 8 character device driver
name will not work with the SNA Server X.25 link service. This
problem was originally found when using the DCA ISCA driver when
communicating over the SNA Server X.25 link service.
<P>
<P>
Update Procedure:
<P>
- Copy the new modules over the existing versions in the above
SNA Server directory locations.  Note: The files located in
the &lt;snaroot&gt;\SYSTEM directory are placed there by SNA Server
setup (copied from the HWSETUP directory), when this link type
is installed.  Be sure to copy them to the HWSETUP directory
so that the updated link support will be used, if the link
service is removed and added using SNA Server setup.
<P>
- Restart the server to load the new IBMSYNC.SYS driver.
