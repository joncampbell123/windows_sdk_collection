The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you use a 16-bit application running on the computer running SNA Server
to open a file on a drive that was created by the SNA Server 3.0 Shared
Folders Gateway (SFGW), you may receive the following error message:
<P>
<PRE>   Cannot access &lt;filename&gt;.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The application is trying to access a file object that is still in the
SFGW file object cache. In this situation, the application was allowed to
try to open the file object as a directory. However, because the file
object points to a file, this attempt fails.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below. As a
workaround, you can either try a 32-bit version of the application, or do
not run the application on the computer running SNA Server.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
