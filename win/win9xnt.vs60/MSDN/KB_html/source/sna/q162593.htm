The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, and 2.11 Service
   Pack 1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Downstream LUs can occasionally get stuck in inactive state after an outage
on the host connection. Even though the host connection reactivates and
host LUs are available, only the first LU will reestablish a session. The
others will stay unavailable. This problem only occurs if the LUs are in
session with a host application when the outage occurs. If the LUs are in
SSCP mode then the problem does not occur.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Suppose you have a computer running SNA Server that is connected to the
host using X.25/QLLC over an X.25 card. On this connection two LUs are
configured on local addresses 05 and 06. Also on the SNA Server an 802.2
downstream connection has been configured and the two LUs from the
X.25/QLLC connection have been assigned. The downstream connection goes
over the Ethernet LAN to a DSPU such as an OS/2 Warp station running IBM
Communication Manager with two LUs on local addresses 02 and 03.
<P>
The problem occurs if an outage occurs or we stop and restart the X.25
connection from the SNA Server Administrator. At this point there is an
error message Event ID 29 in the application event log:
<P>
<PRE>   Internal Gateway Error
    Sense code  = 4592
      Parameter 1 = 43
      Parameter 2 = 68
      Parameter 3 = 0
      Parameter 4 = 0
      Parameter 5 = 0
      Parameter 6 = 0

</PRE>After this only the first LU will reestablish a session . The other will
stay unavailable.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
During the processing of messages from the HOST on the LU-SSCP session,
there is a timing window in the Finite State Machine that can cause the LPI
addresses to get confused. A code change was made to prevent this happening
by reinitializing  the connection LPI addresses prior to sending an
OPEN(SSCP).
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
An update to SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 1 corrects this problem.
The updated module is Snaservr.exe.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 2.0,
2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1.
A supported fix is now available for SNA Server 2.11, but has not been
fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing
this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific
problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that
contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more
information.
