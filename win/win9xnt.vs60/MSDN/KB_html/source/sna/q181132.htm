The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0SP1, 3.0SP2, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
AS/400 print jobs that had been printing properly with SNA Server 3.0 
and 3.0 Service Pack 1, may produce an extra Form Feed after applying 
SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 2 and configuring AS/400 print sessions 
to use Host Print Transform (HPT). This problem is not easily 
reproduced and rarely occurs.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Print jobs printed over sessions configured with HPT enabled are 
printed as transparent print jobs since the job is rendered by print 
drivers on the AS/400. Print Server does not know that it is 
receiving a transparent job until it receives the x'03' byte at the 
start of the HPT data. Before receiving this byte, Print Server had 
made a call to StartDoc() to begin GDI printing. Transparent jobs are 
not printed through the GDI. When the print service realizes this is 
a transparent job, it calls CancelDoc() to end the previous 
StartDoc() call. The GDI always produces a a Form Feed when 
CancelDoc() is called and it is this Form Feed that causes the problem.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Configure the print sessions to use a PDF file since this indicates 
that the job will be transparent, therefore the Print Server will not 
call StartDoc().
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 
3.0 SP2 and 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested 
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. 
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft 
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Print Server now recognizes when HPT has been configured in the printer 
session properties, and will internally generate a blank PDT file to use. 
This has the effect of informing  Print Server to use the transparent 
printer interface and, will not result in any unwanted PCL sequences being 
sent to the printer.
<PRE> 
</PRE>NOTE: For this fix to work, you must configure HPT in your print session 
properties.
