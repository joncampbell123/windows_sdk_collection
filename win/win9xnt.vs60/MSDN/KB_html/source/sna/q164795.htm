<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Print jobs created using Office Vision 400 will not print until the print
session is cycled on and then off.
<P>
What happens is that the print job sits at the WTR status until the print
session in SNA Manager is recycled, at which time the job prints normally.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
There was a problem in Ppd5250.exe that has now been fixed. The print
subsystem was sending back a response with a zero-length RU, which made
the AS/400 give the print subsystem direction again (because it was
expecting a proper response). Ppd5250.exe then gave the AS/400 direction,
but it still had the zero-length RU. So the AS/400 returned direction back
again, and this process repeated over and over.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
A fix is available to correct this problem.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
