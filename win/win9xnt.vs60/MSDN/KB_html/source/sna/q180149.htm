The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you print multiple LU3 host print jobs to an SNA Server system, the
second print job may fail to print. In addition, SNA Server will terminate
the print session, which causes the printer logical unit (LU) on the host
to be deactivated.
<P>
This problem occurs when the second print job is not preceded by a BID
command from the host. In this case, the second print job begins with the
first part of the actual print data. SNA Server will log the following
event in the Windows NT Application Event log when the problem occurs:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 12
   Source: SNA Server
   Description: (1118) Negative Response from Remote System (SENSE = 4011)


</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
When SNA Server receives first portion of the print data for the second
print job, it sends it to the print server. The print server responds with
a BID ACK (Acknowledgement). Because the second print job did not begin
with a BID message, SNA Server never sent a BID to the print server, so it
responds to this message with an error. The error message contains a sense
code of 4011. Sense Code 4011 is defined in the IBM SNA Formats Guide (GA27-
3136).
<P>
The print server responds with a BID ACK message because the LU3 printing
code assumes that anything it receives that causes the Winvprt.dll file to
start a print job is a BID message. This causes it to always respond with a
BID ACK at the beginning of a new LU3 print job.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0,
3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, and 4.0.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
