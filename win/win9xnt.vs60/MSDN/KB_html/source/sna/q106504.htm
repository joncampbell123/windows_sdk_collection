<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Previously, when you used the SNA Server Windows 3.x client to communicate
to the server over TCP/IP sockets, Netware IPX/SPX, or Banyan IP, you were
not able to change your Windows NT password if the password had expired on
the Windows NT Server.
<P>
Support for SNA Server Windows 3.x clients to change their expired Windows
NT password has been added in SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 1. For this to
work, apply the Service Pack to the SNA Server 2.11 server and to the
Windows 3.x client. Also apply Service Pack 2 (or higher) to Windows NT
3.51 on the Primary Domain Controller (PDC).
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
This enhancement to the SNA Server Win3x client now allows clients running
non-named pipes interface along with the SNA Server Win3x 2.11 client to
have the ability to change their expired password in the Windows NT Server
domain. This enhancement works across all protocol stacks that are able to
use the SNA Server Win3x client software to access the SNA Server.
<P>
This enhancement to the SNA Server Client is possible due to enhancements
made in NT 3.51 Service Pack 2. To make use of this feature, the Primary
Domain Controller (PDC) must be running Windows NT 3.51 with Service Pack 2
or later. The SNA Server(s) do not necessarily need to be running at this
level but it is recommended.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
This feature is included in the latest U.S. Service Pack for SNA Server for
Windows NT, version 2.11. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
