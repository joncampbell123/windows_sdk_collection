<P>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, version 2.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article discusses the new SNA Server ability to support Internet
Firewalls and then gives instruction on the following:

<UL><LI>How to allow SNA Server clients and SNA Servers to interoperate with
   screening routers, where the client does know the address of the SNA
   Server(s).

<LI>How to allow SNA Server clients and SNA Servers to interoperate with
   full-blown Internet firewalls, where the end user is not allowed to know
   the IP address of the SNA Server(s).
<P>
</UL><h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
 
<P>
SNA server can be configured to use specific software port numbers.
Specific port numbers are commonly defined in software components to allow
administrators of Internet firewalls to filter packets based on port
number, thereby denying/accepting their propagation to the private network.
By assigning specific destination port numbers to SNA Server components,
SNA Server can interoperate with screening routers and full-blown firewalls
to meet the requirement that users of the public network should not know
the IP address of the SNA Server.
<P>
I. SNA Server Clients and SNA Servers Interoperation with
<P><h2>Screening Routers (Client knows the address of the SNA Server(s))</h2>
 
<P>
The following are the instructions on how to allow SNA Server clients and
SNA Servers to interoperate with screening routers, where the client does
know the address of the SNA Server(s).
<P>
Destination port numbers are configurable in SNA Server on the following
platforms:

<UL><LI>Windows NT
<LI>Windows 95
<LI>Windows 3.x
<P>
</UL>The following transport protocols can be used:

<UL><LI>TCP/IP
<LI>IPX/SPX
<LI>Vines IP
<P>
</UL>Each transport has the following three components that can have
administrator defined destination ports assigned to them:

<UL><LI>DatagramPort.
<P>
   This port is used for datagram (mostly broadcast or multicast) traffic.
   Use the Server Broadcasts dialog in SNA Server Admin to control which
   transport is used for Server to Server communication.

<LI>SnaBasePort.
<P>
   This is the port where the server SnaBase listens for new client sponsor
   connections. Sponsor connections are used by the SNA Server client to
   learn about the SNA Server subdomain in which it participates.

<LI>SnaServerPort.
<P>
   This is the port where the SNASERVR.EXE waits for new application
   session requests.
<P>
</UL>The default values for destination port numbers are:
<P>
<PRE>   Port            TCP/IP   IPX/SPX     Vines
   --------------------------------------------
   DatagramPort    1478     0x84C8      381
   SnaBasePort     1478     0x84C8      381
   SnaServerPort   1477     0x84C9      dynamic

</PRE>There is no need to change any of these ports except when it is necessary
to run each SNA Server service and SNABase service with a unique port
number. It is the administrator’s responsibility to make sure that the
ports are not used by other applications on the network.
<P>
NOTE: The DatagramPort must be the same in every server in a subdomain.
<P>
On Windows NT, the ports are configured in the registry under the subtree
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE under the subkey:
<P>
<PRE>   System\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaBase\Parameters\&lt;transport&gt;\

</PRE>where &lt;transport&gt; is SnaTcp, SnaSpx, or SnaVines.
<P>
Add the following value name under the &lt;transport&gt; subkey:
<P>
<PRE>   Value Name: &lt;port&gt;
   Data Type:  REG_DWORD

</PRE>where &lt;port&gt; is DatagramPort, SnaBasePort, or SnaServerPort.
<P>
On Windows 95, the ports are configured in the registry under the subtree
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE under the subkey:
<P>
<PRE>   Software\Microsoft\SnaBase\Parameters\&lt;transport&gt;\

</PRE>where &lt;transport&gt; is SnaTcp, SnaSpx, or SnaVines.
<P>
Add the following value name under the &lt;transport&gt; subkey:
<P>
<PRE>   Value Name: &lt;port&gt;
   Data Type:  REG_DWORD

</PRE>where &lt;port&gt; is DatagramPort, SnaBasePort, or SnaServerPort.
<P>
On Windows 3.x, the ports are configured in the WIN.INI file under the
[WNAP] section:
<P>
<PRE>   [WNAP]
   &lt;port&gt;=&lt;value&gt;

</PRE>where &lt;port&gt; is DatagramPort, SnaBasePort, or SnaServerPort and value is
the port number either in decimal or hexadecimal notation.
<P>
<P><h3>Remote TCP/IP Clients</h3>
 
<P>
For TCP/IP it is not enough just to add one SnaBasePort number to the
WIN.INI file or registry in Windows NT or Windows 95. Because every SNA
Server in the subdomain is potentially using a different destination port
number, every sponsor server requires its own entry. To make this possible,
the port names can be prefixed with a server name. For example, if the
SnaBase service on the server Server_A is using destination port 1234 and
the server Server_B is using destination port number 5678, you need to add
the following entries into the WIN.INI file or registry:
<P>
Windows NT or Windows 95 registry:
<P>
<PRE>   Server_ASnaBasePort:REG_DWORD:1234
   Server_BSnaBasePort:REG_DWORD:5678

</PRE>Windows 3.x WIN.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   Server_ASnaBasePort=1234
   Server_BSnaBasePort=5678

</PRE>The clients get the SnaServer ports through the sponsor connection. On
IPX/SPX and Vines IP, the clients get the SnaBase ports from the NetWare
bindery and Vines StreetTalk respectively. There is no need to configure
any port numbers on these two client types.
<P>
<P><h3>OtherServers</h3>
 
<P>
When you use the OtherServers parameter, use the following convention in
the WIN.INI file under the [WNAP] section:
<P>
<PRE>   [WNAP]
   &lt;server_nameX&gt;SnaServerPort=3333
   &lt;server_nameY&gt;SnaServerPort=4444

</PRE>You still need to include the following entry in this section:
<P>
<PRE>   Otherservers=&lt;server_nameX&gt; &lt;servernameY&gt;

</PRE>II. SNA Server Clients and SNA Servers Interoperation with Full-Blown
<P><h2>Internet firewalls (Client Cannot Know the IP address of the SNA Server(s))</h2>
 
<P>
The following are the instructions on how to allow SNA Server clients and
SNA Servers to interoperate with full-blown Internet firewalls, where the
client is not allowed to know the IP address of the SNA Server(s).
<P>
First, follow directions in section I. above. Then, add the following entry
to the respective platform:
<P>
Windows NT:

<OL><P><LI>In the registry, go to the subtree HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE under the
   following subkey:
<P>
<P><PRE>      System\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaBase\Parameters\SnaTcp\
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add the following information:
<P>
   Value Name: FireWall
   Data Type:  REG_MULTI_SZ
<PRE>   Data:       &lt;list of firewall IP addresses&gt;

</PRE></OL>Windows 95:

<OL><P><LI>In the registry, go to the subtree HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE under the
   following subkey:
<P>
<P><PRE>      Software\Microsoft\SnaBase\Parameters\SnaTcp\
</PRE>
<P><LI>Add the following information:
<P>
   Value Name: FireWall
   Data Type:  REG_SZ
<PRE>   Data:       &lt;list of firewall IP addresses&gt;

   Note: The list can be separated by spaces, commas, or semicolons.

</PRE></OL>Windows 3.x:

<OL><P><LI>Add the following information in the WIN.INI file under the [WNAP]
   section:
<P>
<P><PRE>      [WNAP]
      FireWall =&lt;list of firewall IP addresses&gt;
</PRE><P>
</OL>The SNA Server IP transport replaces the real destination IP address with a
firewall address when it opens a connection to an SNA Server for both
application sessions or sponsor connection.
<P>
Microsoft has updated the following files:
<P>
<PRE>   LIBS\WIN32\SNAIP.DLL
   LIBS\WIN32\SNANW.DLL
   LIBS\WIN32\SNABV.DLL
   LIBS\WIN95\SNACIP.DLL
   LIBS\WIN95\SNACNW.DLL
   LIBS\WIN95\SNACBV.DLL
   EXE\WIN16\IPCLI.DLL
