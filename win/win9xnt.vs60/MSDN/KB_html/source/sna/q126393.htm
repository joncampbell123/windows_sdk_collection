The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1,
   and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The following SNA Server XID rejection events are logged in the application
event log you connect to an AS/400:

<UL><LI>Event ID: 56
   Event description: Connection &lt;connection_name&gt; failed: XID
   rejected by remote computer

<LI>Event ID: 230
   Event Description: Connection &lt;connection_name&gt; Not responding
   to XID commands.
<P>
</UL>The connection goes into a Pending state and users get APPC primary return
code: 0003; secondary return code: 00000005,  when attempting to open a
5250 session.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
Causes of Event ID 56:

<UL><LI>There is already a controller defined on the AS/400 with the same name
   as the one defined in SNA Server, but it has a different "LAN remote
   adapter address (ADPTADR)" associated with it.

<LI>There is already a different controller name defined on the AS/400
   with the same "LAN remote adapter address (ADPTADR)" (Autocreate
   Controller [AUTOCRTCTL] is set to YES in the AS/400 Line Description).

<LI>The "LAN remote adapter address (ADPTADR)" defined on the AS/400
   represents the network interface card address of the SNA Server machine.
   To determine this, type the following at a Windows NT Command Prompt:
<P>
<P><PRE>      c:&gt; net config server
</PRE>
<LI>The Remote Control Point Name in the SNA Server Administrator Connection
   Properties dialog box does not match the Local Control Point Name in the
   AS/400 Network Attributes screen.
<P>
</UL>Causes of Event ID 230:

<UL><LI>Autocreate controller (AUTOCRTCTL), which is configured in the AS/400
   Line Description, is set to No and you are using the incorrect Local
   Node ID value for the controller you have manually created on the
   AS/400.

<LI>The Remote SAP Address in the SNA Server connection properties is
   different than the SSAP address in the AS/400 line description.
<P>
   NOTE: The SAP address defined in the SNA Server link service setup
   does not have to match anything on the AS/400.

<LI>The administrator configured the Remote Network Address using an address
   that already exists on the LAN (and is bound to the DLC protocol) but it
   is not the address that the AS/400 administrator is attempting to
   connect to. For example, an administrator used the SNA Server machine
   address or other Windows NT machine that has the MS-DLC protocol
   installed.
