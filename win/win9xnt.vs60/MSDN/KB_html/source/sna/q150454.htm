<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
It is not recommended that you assign different LUs to user groups that
have members in common because the results cannot be predicted.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
According to the SNA Server “Administration Guide,” Chapter 6:
<P>
<PRE>   If a user is assigned LUs through one or more accounts, such as group
   accounts and the user's individual account, the LUs do not accumulate.
   Instead, one account determines the access for that user. The account
   that determines this access is the account found first in the following
   search order:

      1. User accounts (highest priority)
      2. Domain groups
      3. Local groups
      4. Well-known groups such as Everyone (lowest priority)

</PRE>However, it does not explain clearly what will happen if two groups are at
the same level (2 local groups).
<P>
SNA Server will use the LUs assigned to whichever group is returned first
from Microsoft Windows NT, and there is no way to predict the order in
which the groups will be returned.
