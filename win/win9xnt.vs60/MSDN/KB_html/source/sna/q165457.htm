<P><h3>Instructions for Decompressing Files</h3>
 
<P>
All of the above files are compressed in self-extracting
archive format, containing SNA Server 3.0 SP1.  To extract
each file, copy the file to a separate empty directory on your
hard drive and run the file using the "-d" option.  For
example:
<P>
<PRE>    30SP1IS.EXE -d &lt;PATH&gt;

</PRE>Where &lt;PATH&gt; is the destination directory for the service
pack. If you wish to extract the service pack to the current
directory, leave &lt;PATH&gt; blank.
<P>
After the service pack file has been decompressed, run the
UPDATE.EXE program to install the updated SNA Server 2.11
server or client files, as appropriate.
<P>
NOTE: The UPDATE program will automatically stop any SNA
Server services which may be running.
<P>
<P><h3>Installing SNA 3.0 Service Pack 1</h3>
 
<P>
** TO BE APPLIED TO SNA SERVER 3.0 SYSTEMS ONLY!! **

in 3.0 SP1. Updates may be applied in any order -- to the
server and/or to the clients. It is recommended that all
systems running SNA Server 3.0 (that is, SNA Servers and
client computers) are updated to 3.0 SP1. It may not be
necessary to update the client computers to SP1 unless you
are experiencing a client problem that has been fixed in SP1.
<P>
WARNING: This service pack update is intended to be applied on
systems currently running SNA Server 3.0 server or client
software.  These updates should NOT be applied over systems
