The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
An SNA Server subdomain is the name given to a logical grouping of SNA servers 
and resources (in other words, link services, connections, LU's, sessions, and 
users) within a given NT domain that share the same configuration file. The 
logical grouping of SNA Server's in this manner can be used to reduce the 
administration and configuration overhead associated with managing a collection 
resouces. 
<P>
There may be times however, when you need to change the name of the SNA Server 
subdomain but would prefer not to go through the process of removing and 
reinstalling SNA Server. Outlined below are the steps that can be performed to 
change the name of the subdomain.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The information concerning which subdomain an SNA Server belongs to is stored in 
both the registry and Snaexp.snav. Snaexp.snav contains information regarding 
the size and position of the main SNA Server Manager window, as well as which 
part of a subdomain is displayed in each multiple document interface (MDI) 
window and the size and position of the MDI windows. Therefore, several steps 
are necessary in order to complete this modification. 
<P>
The registry information is located at:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SNABase\Parameters\
   SNADomain REG_SZ: &lt;subdomain name&gt;

</PRE>Perform the following steps on each SNA Server participating in the subdomain:

<OL><P><LI>Stop all SNA services. 
</OL>2. Run the Svconfig.exe utility which which is found in &lt;snaroot&gt;\system
<PRE>   directory.
</PRE></OL>3. Change the SUBDOMAIN NAME field to the desired one.
4. Apply change and click OK to exit.
5. Restart the SNA services.
<P>
Perform the following steps where SNA Manager has previously run:

<OL><P><LI>Delete the file SNAEXP.SNAV located in the &lt;snaroot&gt;\system subdirectory. 
<P>
</OL>NOTE: This file will get recreated when SNA Manager is restarted.
<P>
NOTE: For SNA clients that are configured to resolve the location of SNA 
Servers via subdomain name, an additional change will be required on the 
client workstation to reflect the new subdomain name. If this change is not 
made, then clients will not be able to locate a SNA Server and fail to create 
a sponsor connection. No chnages are required for clients that are configured 
to locate a server by name.
