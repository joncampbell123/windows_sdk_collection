<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1), and 3.0
   Service Pack 2 (SP2)

<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the 5250 applet as well as some third-party 5250 emulators,
the Windows NT SNA Client attempting to reconnect to the host may take an
extra 20 seconds to restart the session. The first time the emulator
connects, the delay may not be evident, but if disconnected, further
attempts to reconnect may take about 20 seconds.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The Winmgt32.dll display verb initializes the DMOD with the client type
"admin," and the wappc32.dll initializes the DMOD with the client type
"TP." If the same application uses both DLLs, the DMOD creates two
different semaphores, because the admin type is treated as a special case
for no reason. In this case the I/O threads were signaling the second
semaphore, but the "routing" thread was waiting on the first semaphore.
This introduced a five-second delay in each incoming frame processing.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
With the fix applied, the special semaphore created for "admin" type client
processes is removed.
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0,
3.0 SP1 and 3.0 SP2.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
