<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
SNA Server generates a Dr. Watson error in SNABASE.EXE when a client does a
RPC call to get a list of Remote APPC LUs which are paired with a Local
APPC LU. The SNA Server logs an Event ID 624 in the Windows NT Application
Log (as shown in the Event Viewer) indicating that a SNADUMP.LOG was
created for SNABASE.EXE. The error also generates a DRWTSN32.LOG when it
occurs. The following is an excerpt from a DRWTSN32.LOG that was created
following one of the SNABASE errors:
<P>
<PRE>   Application exception occurred:
   App: C:\SNA\system\snabase.exe (pid=139)
   When: 8/7/1995 @ 10:38:21.884
   Exception number: c0000005 (access violation)

</PRE>Your DRWTSN32.LOG file will appear somewhat different than this example.
<P>
NOTE: If using Windows NT Server 3.5, you will have to load the Windows NT
Symbols to get a proper Dr. Watson log when using SNA Server.
<P>
After the SNABASE error occurs, the SNA Server stops accepting sessions
from SNA Server clients until the SNA Server is shutdown and restarted.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This error is caused when SNA Server tries to copy (read) a larger range of
memory than is in a memory buffer. This happens when a client makes an RPC
call to get the list of Remote APPC LUs partnered with a particular Local
APPC LU and the number of Remote APPC LUs exceed the size of the client's
buffer. The error only occurs if the memory buffer is located at the end of
a 4K page and the extra memory that SNA Server attempts to read is located
on the next uncommitted page. The buffer size is usually less than one
hundred bytes so the probability of this error is quite small.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has modified the files, SNABASE.EXE and SNADMOD.DLL, to correct
this problem.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT.
This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on
