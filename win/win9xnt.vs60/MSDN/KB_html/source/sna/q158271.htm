<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, version 2.11 Service Pack 1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
If you use SNA Server version 2.11 Service Pack 1 (SP1) Windows 3.x client
software, and you connect to SNA Server over TCP/IP sockets, NetWare
IPX/SPX, or Banyan IP, you may experience the following problem.
<P>
The SNA Server Windows 95 client software does not support the ability to
change the Microsoft Windows NT password during SNA client logon. If the
Windows NT administrator has configured their Windows NT user accounts for
User Must Change Password at Next Logon, or if the user password has
expired, the SNA Server Windows 95 client will display the following error
messages:
<P>
<PRE>   SnaBase
   ERROR: Cound not open sponsor connection to &lt;servername&gt;
   Do you want to run the SNA Client configuration program ?

   ERROR: The SnaBase Service is not started.

</PRE>NOTE: Many possible causes exist for a logon error besides a bad user ID,
password, domain, or expired password. Other possibilities include:

<UL><LI>The user account has been disabled.

<LI>The user account has been locked out due to excessive failed logon
   attempts.

<LI>Restricted user logon hours has been defined.

<LI>The user must logon from a specific workstation.

<LI>The user is logging on using a trusted domain account and Windows NT
   is currently unable to contact a domain controller in the trusted
   domain.
<P>
</UL><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The SNA Server Windows 95 client does not support the Windows NT password
change function.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Do one of the following:

<UL><LI>Use the Windows 95 Control Panel Password utility to change the user’s
   Windows NT password. This requires that the Windows 95 user is
   already logging into the Windows NT domain (for example, to the domain
   user account that has been assigned SNA Server resources) and his or
   her Windows 95 computer is configured with the Microsoft Networking
   redirector.

<LI>Disable password expiration on the Windows NT account used by the SNA
   Server Windows 95 user.

<LI>Require the Windows NT administrator to reset the Windows NT account
   when the SNA Windows 95 client logon fails.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server
version 2.11 and 2.11 Service Pack 1 Windows 95 client software. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
