The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, and
   3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
The MicroGate SDLC Link Service may report an IRQ conflict if the MicroGate
MG96 or MG144 SDLC adapter is installed in a SNA Server. When you select
Adapter Details during the MicroGate link service installation, you will
see information similar to the following if this problem occurs:
<P>
<PRE>   I/O Port Address:   0x380
   Interrupt(IRQ):     conflict?
   DMA Channel:        1

</PRE>The System Event Log may also contain the following errors:
<P>
<PRE>   Event ID: 7001
   Source: Service Control Manager
   Description: The SnaMG1 service depends on the IBMSYNC service which
   failed to start because of the following error: A device attached to
   the system is not functioning.

   Event ID: 7000
   Source: Service Control Manager
   Description: The IBMSYNC service failed to start due to the following
   error:
   A device attached to the system is not functioning.

</PRE><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The MicroGate MG96 and MG144 SDLC adapters include a built-in V.32 modem.
These adapters are hardwired to use IRQs 3 and 4. Microsoft Windows NT
detects IRQ3 as being used by the UART on these adapters during its startup
sequence.
<P>
<P><h2>WORKAROUND</h2>
 
<P>
Change the dip switches on the MicroGate SDLC adapter to have the UART use
COM3, instead of COM2, which is the default. The changes must be made via
dip switches on the adapter because they are not software configurable. The
diagnostics software will allow you to make configuration changes and test
the changes. However, the changes are written to a configuration file and
do not change the adapter settings.
<P>
The default dip switch settings on the adapter are:
<P>
S1: 1-8:  01111001 (0=off, 1=on) S2: 1-4: 1111 (all flipped up to ON
position)
<P>
Change the dip switches to:
<P>
<PRE>S1: 1-8:  10011001               S2: 1-4: 0111

</PRE>This instructs the adapter to use COM3 for the UART.
<P>
UART = COM3, Base Address = x'03e8', IRQ = 5
