The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11 and 2.11 Service Pack 1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Some TN3270E printer emulators may encounter a dropped session while
receiving a large host print job. This problem has been observed with the
Attachmate Extra! TN3270E print emulator, although it may occur with other
print emulators as well.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The TN3270E protocol specification has no provision for flow control
between the server and the client. If the host sends a print job to the
emulator using only the exception response protocol (RQE), there is no way
for a TN3270E print emulator to indicate any flow control information, used
to "throttle back" the rate that the host sends the print job, to the
TN3270E server.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below. In the hotfix,
the TN3270E server has been updated to include a new configuration option
called "Printer Flow Control." When this option is enabled, the TN3270E
server sends all messages to TN3270E printers using definite response
protocol (RQD), instead of exception response (RQE). This is implemented as
a check box option because this behavior contradicts the TN3270E
specification (although it is required for such print emulators to
function).
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server
versions 2.11 and 2.11 Service Pack 1.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
