The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 Service Pack 1 (SP1), and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
Customers have often requested a capability for an invoking APPC
transaction program (TP) to use security option "Already Verified", even in
cases where the invoking TP was not invoked by some other APPC TP. This
capability was always available in SNA Server, but somewhat inefficient in
implementation. In SNA Server and other industry standard implementations
of APPC, it is possible to implement a "pass through" TP, which could be
invoked by the real invoking TP, and merely passes on the messages from the
original invoking TP.
<P>
For a trusted APPC application, it is inefficient to issue originating
(that is, invoking) APPC conversations on behalf of multiple users using
APPC "Already Verified" security.
<P>
The direct approach would be to issue an [MC_]ALLOCATE APPC verb specifying
both security=AP_SAME and an arbitrary username in the verb control block
(VCB). The corresponding action in CPI-C would be to call cmscst(,
CM_SECURITY_SAME,) and cmscsu( , &lt;someUser&gt; . . .), or provide this
information in the symbolic destination definition. However, actually doing
either of these results in an APPC conversation that ignores the value of
the username parameter.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
This limitation is behavior specified in version 1.2 of the WOSA WinAPPC
and WinCPIC specifications. It has been implemented in other APPC
libraries, such as Communications Manager 1.0.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
The SNA Server WinAPPC and WinCPIC APIs will support an extension as
follows:

<UL><LI>A TP was invoked by another TP, and now initiates a conversation
   specifying security type SAME:
<P>
   Any username that might be be specified in the VCB is ignored, and the
   system will provide the already verified username under which the TP was
   invoked, and set the "already verified" indicator in the outgoing
   conversation request. This behavior is unchanged.

<LI>The TP was not invoked by another TP, issues a conversation startup
   request with security type SAME, and provides a user name: The system
   will copy the specified username into the outgoing conversation request
   and set the "already verified" indicator.

<LI>The TP was not invoked by another TP, issues a conversation startup
   request with security type SAME, but does not provide a user name: The
   system will check for environment value: AP_SAMENOSUser. If this has a
   value starting with Y, the system will provide the current logged- on
   user name in the outgoing conversation request. If the environment value
   is not defined, or has some other value, the system will provide *no*
   username in the outgoing conversation request.
<P>
</UL><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.0,
2.10, 2.11 and 2.11 Service Pack 1 (SP1) 2.11.
A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested
and should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem.
Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix.
Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.

been replaced with the AP_SAMENOSUser registry entry in SNA Server version
3.0), please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
