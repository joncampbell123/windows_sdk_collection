The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server version 2.11, 2.11 Service Pack 1, and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When SNA Server receives an SNA message from the host with the
Change-Direction (CD) bit set on a full duplex LU0 session, SNA Server
will reject the message with sense code 400D:
<P>
<PRE>   Event 21: Negative Response Sent on Connection &lt;value&gt; (SENSE=400D)

</PRE>where 400D = CD Not Supported: The Change-Direction indicator was set,
<PRE>             but is not supported

</PRE>SNA Server can be configured to work around this host problem by setting
the NO400D registry value as defined below. However, even with this option
set, SNA Server still does not allow an LUA (RUI or SLI) application to set
the CD bit on a full duplex LU0 session, since this is a protocol
violation.
<P>
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When a host application initiates an LU0 session with full duplex
send/receive mode (by setting bit 0-1 to "00" in Byte 7 of the BIND
message), this indicates that the Change Direction (CD) bit is not to be
used on the session. The Change Direction bit is only used on half-duplex
sessions to indicate which end has direction to send on a session.
<P>
However, some host applications may still set the CD bit on a full duplex
session, though this is a protocol violation. However, it may not be
possible to fix the host application, so SNA Server will ignore this
message by enabling the following registry key:
<P>
<PRE>   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/
   SnaServr/Parameters/

   NO400D: REG_SZ: YES

</PRE>This causes SNA Server to ignore any messages received on an LU0 full 
duplex session which has the CD bit set. However, the LUA (RUI or SLI) 
application running on SNA Server is still not allowed to set the CD bit 
when sending messages to the host on a full duplex LU0 session, since 
this is a protocol violation.
<P>
NOTE: For information about the BIND command, see the IBM SNA Formats
Guide, IBM part number GA27-3136.
