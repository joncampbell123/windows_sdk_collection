The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.1, 2.11, and
   2.11 Service Pack 1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you use the IBM CA/400 client, and if Shared Folders is configured to
automatically create a mapped drive to the AS/400, the conversation ends
abnormally. The Shared Folders will not be available through File Manager.
<P>
If the drive letter is manually assigned in Shared Folders and the window
is minimized, the Shared Folders can be accessed. However, if you close the
Shared Folders application, the drive is lost.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
In order to support IBM Client Access Shared Folders, the SNA Server
Windows 3.x client must allow shared folders to share an APPC conversation
and TCP/IP socket handle between different Windows tasks, which is not
normally supported by Windows APPC or the Windows sockets interface.
However, the SNA Server Windows 3.x client software treats CA/400 Shared
Folders as a special application; however it was not handling all
conditions properly.
<P>
To prevent a Shared Folders drive from being shut down, verify that the
following line is in the WIN.INI file:
<P>
<PRE>   CA400SHAREDFOLDERS=YES

</PRE>Then add a new parameter called PersistentTasks under the [WNAP] section:
<P>
<PRE>   [WNAP]
   PersistentTasks=WSTRPCS SFANSW

</PRE>NOTE: The WSTRPCS parameter takes care of automatically mapping the
connections, and the SFANSW parameter resolves the issue with closing the
CA/400 Folders dialog box without losing the drives you created.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server
version 2.11.sp1.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
