<P><h3> </h3>
 
The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11,
   2.11 Service Pack 1, 2.11 Service Pack 2, 3.0, and 3.0 Service 
   Pack 1
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
When you communicate over 802.2 Token Ring or Ethernet, the following
parameters affect the Maximum Basic Transmission Unit (BTU) or "frame"
size used by SNA Server for the 802.2 connection:

<UL><LI>The "Max BTU" value configured within SNA Server Admin 802.2 Connection
   Advanced dialog.

<LI>The maximum frame size supported by the Microsoft Windows NT NDIS driver
   and Token Ring adapter.

<LI>The maximum frame size configured on the remote system, if the SNA
   Server receives a Format 3 XID message from the remote system during
   connection activation.
<P>
</UL>The maximum frame size supported by SNA Server will be the minimum value
encountered above.
<P>
NOTE: See Chapter 2 of the “IBM SNA Formats Guide” (GA27-3136) for a
description of Format 0 and Format 3 SNA XID messages.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following is more detail on how SNA Server determines the Maximum BTU
size on an 802.2 connection:

<UL><LI>In SNA Server Admin, the administrator configures the Maximum BTU size
   in the Advanced dialog for the 802.2 connection.
<P>
   SNA Server supports a maximum of 16393 bytes for 16Mbps Token Ring, 4195
   for 4Mbps Token Ring, and 1493 for Ethernet. The Token Ring limits match
   the maximum values supported by the IBM Token Ring 16/4 adapter. The
   Ethernet limit is due to architectural limitations of the Ethernet
   media. The Max BTU size determines the maximum frame size that SNA
   Server will send.

<LI>When the SNA Server 802.2 link service opens the adapter (using the
   DLC DIR_OPEN_ADAPTER command), it retrieves the max_i_field size from
   the DHB buffer for the adapter. The Windows NT DLC transport gets this
   max_i_field size from the NDIS driver (presumably, the NDIS driver
   determines the maximum frame size from the adapter configuration, or
   using an internal default).
<P>
   NOTE: Some NDIS drivers may be hard-coded to support a maximum frame
   size of 4 kilobytes.

<LI>SNA Server compares the Max BTU size configured on the connection with
   the value returned by the DIR_OPEN_ADAPTER command (for example, the
   value supported by the NDIS driver), and uses the value that is the
   minimum. The SNA Server 802.2 link service then issues a DLC_OPEN_SAP
   command and sets the maximum BTU size in the max_i_field in the DLC
   buffer.

<LI>SNA Server then initiates a SNA XID exchange with the remote system as
   part of the connection activation process. If SNA XID Format 3 messages
   are used in the exchange (SNA Server defaults to use XID Format 3), then
   the XID indicates the maximum BTU size (in Byte 21-22 of the Format 3
   XID) that the system can receive. If the remote system's Format 3 XID
   indicates a Max BTU size that is *less* than the Max BTU size currently
   set in SNA Server, the minimum value is chosen.
<P>
   NOTE: When you communicate with an IBM host system, the maximum frame
   size that can be received by the host is configured in the MAXDATA
   parameter in the VTAM PU definition. When you communicate with an IBM
   AS/400 system, the maximum frame size that can be received by the AS/400
   is configured in the MAXFRAME parameter in the AS/400 line description
   (this is not the same as the MAXFRAME parameter within the APPC
   Controller description).
<P>
</UL>If the SNA Format 0 XIDs are used during connection activation, then the
max BTU size is not indicated in the XID message; as a result, the local
and remote system's configurations should match to prevent connection
problems.
<P>
<P><h3>Definition of Max BTU Size and VTAM MAXDATA Size</h3>
 
<P>
The Max BTU size and the MAXDATA refer to the size of LLC Information frame
(I-frame) that can be transmitted. This includes the SNA Transmission
Header (TH) , Request/Response Header (RH), and at least a portion of the
Request/Response Unit (RU). The I-frame does not include the Mac and LLC
header. For example:
<P>
<PRE>  ---------------  ---------------  -----------------------------
  | TH (6 bytes)|  | RH (3 bytes)|  |  RU (as long as you like) |
  ---------------  ---------------  -----------------------------

</PRE>If the total length exceeds the Max BTU size, then the data is segmented
into two or more I-frames similar to the following:
<P>
<PRE>  ---------------  ---------------  --------------------
  | TH (6 bytes)|  | RH (3 bytes)|  |  RU (some of it) |
  ---------------  ---------------  --------------------

  ---------------  ----------------------
  | TH (6 bytes)|  | RU (rest of it)    |
  ---------------  ----------------------

</PRE>The TH contains flags indicating whether the frame is part of a segmented
RU or not.
<P>
In each connection between two end points, there are potentially two
MAXDATA sizes; each one being the size which one end can receive. It is
perfectly legal for one end to be able to receive 265 bytes, and the other
end 521 bytes. When the Max BTU size is configured on SNA Server, that size
refers to the size of data you can send.
<P>
It is possible for SNA Server to have control over the size of data it
receives if the connection uses Format 3 XIDs---in these you specify the
maximum BTU size you can receive. If the connection uses Format 0 XIDs then
it is up to the configuration to make sure that one end does not send the
other end a larger frame than it can accept.
<P>
<P><h3>SNA Server Downstream Physical Units (DSPU) Considerations</h3>
 
<P>
When you connect Downstream PU 2.0 devices through the SNA Server DSPU
feature, the handling of Max BTU size is more complicated because there are
two SNA Server connections involved---the SNA Server host connection and
the SNA Server Downstream PU connection. Most of the time the maximum BTU
sizes on these two connections do not effect each other, because the SNA
Server in the middle will do any segmentation as needed.
<P>
<PRE>--------        -------------          -----------
| DSPU |--------|    SNA    |----------|   HOST  |
--------        |   SERVER  |          -----------
                -------------

</PRE>Consider the case of the diagram above. If the DSPU (downstream PU2.0
device) supports a frame size of 521 bytes, and the host connection
supports a frame size of 265 bytes, then when the DSPU sends SNA Server a
frame of 521 bytes, SNA Server will segment it into two frames before
sending it to the host. In this case, there is no relationship between the
DSPUs MAXDATA configuration setting and the host's MAXDATA value configured
on the VTAM Physical Unit description.
<P>
There is one exception. Some SNA sessions do not support segmentation;
these are the SSCP-PU and the SSCP-LU sessions. If Format 0 XIDs are used
during connection activation (the only value supported by PU2.0 devices),
SNA Server is not notified of the maximum BTU size supported by the DSPU
device. If the host sends a USSMSG10 SSCP "banner" screen with an RU size
of 512 bytes, but the DSPU only supports a Max BTU size of 265 bytes, then
the DSPU may reject the logon screen with a frame reject (FRMR), or
possibly hang if it does not handle this properly. To work around this,
configure the RU size on the SSCP-LU session no larger than the DSPUs
MAXDATA size (taking the TH and RH into account).
