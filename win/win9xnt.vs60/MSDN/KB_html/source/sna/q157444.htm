The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
This article describes how to troubleshoot SNA Server Event 17 or Event 18
errors that specify a sense data value of 0835xxxx (where xxxx may vary),
and describes situations where this sense code may occur.
<P>
Notes:

<UL><LI>The last 4 hex digits (xxxx) correspond to an offset within the BIND
   command that points to the parameter that was not recognized or
   supported by the BIND receiver.

<LI>The Event 17 error is logged by SNA Server when it rejects a BIND
   request received from the remote system.

<LI>The Event 18 error is logged when the remote system rejects a BIND
   request sent by SNA Server.
<P>
</UL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The Sense Data section of the IBM SNA “Formats Guide” describes Sense Code
0835xxxx as:
<P>
<PRE>   Invalid Parameter (with Pointer Only): The request contained a fixed or
   variable length field whose contents are invalid or not supported by the
   NAU that received the request; or a +RSP(BIND) received at an
   intermediate node within a session path contained such an error.

</PRE>The last four digits of the sense code is the hexadecimal offset within the
BIND request (where the BIND command 0x31 is byte 0) of the parameter in
error. The offset may point to a PLU name, SLU name, or Mode name that is
not configured or a BIND parameter that is not supported by the remote
system or SNA Server.
<P>
The IBM SNA “Formats Guide” contains the format of RU (Request Units) as
well as detailed instructions on how to parse the BIND Request Unit to
determine the parameter that is not recognized or supported. The following
is an excerpt from an SNA Server Data Link Control message trace that shows
a BIND request and BIND negative response that includes a 0835xxxx sense
code error:

</PRE>The sense code on frame #2 (08350001) points towards an invalid parameter
on the first byte of its corresponding BIND request. Using IBM SNA formats,
the parameter at fault is the parameter that determines whether the BIND
type is negotiable (Only value allowed for LU6.2), or non- negotiable.
According to the formats, a negotiable BIND is being sent. If the system
responding does not support a negotiable BIND for that type of session, the
08350001 sense code may be returned.
<P>
Below is a summary of some of the 0835 sense codes that have been found to
cause problems, as well as some troubleshooting hints.
<P>
NOTE: After doing basic troubleshooting, the most effective way of
determining the cause of a failure is by parsing the RU for the parameter
in question, and verifying its value against the configuration of both the
host and the SNA Server. Usually the events 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 in the
Application Log will contain the sense code as well as the RU in question.
<P>
If a brief inspection of the configuration does not yield a successful
resolution, it is usually best to examine the RU. The same sense code in
some cases may point to different parameters, depending on the amount of
parameters sent on the RU.
<P>
08350001 - This sense code generally occurs when the host system does not
support the type of BIND submitted by the SNA Server, but it also has been
seen when the BIND contains a mismatched session and type request, for
example, a non-negotiable BIND for an LU6.2 session. The second case is
rare, and may prompt verification of the configuration, and of the XID type
being negotiated upon connection. Some versions 3.x of IMS do not support
LU 6.2; therefore, it may send the sense code.
<P>
08350018 - This sense code points to a byte that contains the bit that
specifies whether the session supports or does not support parallel
sessions. If the support parallel sessions flag is set on an LU that does
not support parallel sessions, or if the host system requests parallel
session support for an LU that has this checkbox unchecked, this sense code
may arise.
<P>
0835003X or 4X - These generally correspond to the portion of the BIND that
deals with Primary or Secondary LU names or APPC mode name. Because the
exact sense code will vary, depending on the length of the LU and mode
names, it is recommended that all LU names and mode names are verified for
correct configuration on both the host system and the SNA Server. Check the
following:

<UL><LI>Flip-flopped LU names (Partner with a source name or vice versa).

<LI>Misspelled LU names.

<LI>Misspelling or mismatching the DLOGMOD entry in VTAM (see your VTAM
   “Programmer's Guide” for details).

<LI>Incorrect or misspelled mode on an LU6.2 partnering in SNA Server.
<P>
</UL>NOTE: The above information was taken from problems noted in various
support cases. It is best to get the application event log, and a Data Link
Control trace from the SNA Server component recording the failure, and
examine the RUs in question for the failure.
