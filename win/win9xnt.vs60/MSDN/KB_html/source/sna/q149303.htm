The information in this article applies to:

<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
Support for TN3287 clients has been added to Microsoft TN3270 Server.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
Support for TN3287 has been added to the TN3270 Server as a hotfix to SNA
Server 2.11 Service Pack 1. This update is available on request from
Microsoft.
<P>
TN3287 provides a different protocol for accessing printer clients, but
there are no changes to the TN3270 configuration. That is, if you have a
TN3270 LU configured to support printer clients it will support both
TN3270E and TN3287 clients. So, when you configure the TN3270 Server, no
special configuration is required for TN3287 clients
<P>
RFC 1646 contains the following text on TN3287:
<P>
<PRE>   The purpose of the TN3287 protocol is to provide a general IBM 3270
   host printer communications facility. Its primary goal is to allow a
   method of connecting printer devices and printer-oriented processes to
   each other. This protocol will allow a TN3270 Client to process 3287
   print data streams.

   The TN3287 Client is a TN3270 client created specifically to print
   mainframe 3270 print data. The client emulates the IBM device type that
   it identifies itself to the TN3270 server as, in this case, an IBM 3287
   model 1 type printer. The design of this printer protocol is aligned
   with the way printing occurs in the IBM host and how 3270 printers
   function. These printer extensions DO NOT support a 3270 printer client
   that cannot accept both types LU1 and LU3 printer streams.

</PRE>Support for the TN3287 data stream requires that both sides:

<UL><LI>Are able to exchange binary data.

<LI>Can establish the agreement between client and server on the terminal
   type that will be used.

<LI>Agree to use the TELNET IAC EOR as a delimiter for inbound and outbound
   TN3287 data streams
<P>
</UL>This implementation requires the options: TERMINAL-TYPE and BINARY be
successfully negotiated between the Client and Server before processing of
any print data streams. The LU type is determined by the bind from the
mainframe application. The server, when bound, must remember LU 1 or LU 3
type. The server will automatically unbind the session upon receipt of a
TELNET CLOSE command. The printer will be reported to VTAM as powered down
until a new TELNET connection is established.
