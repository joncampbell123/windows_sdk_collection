The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server version 2.0, 2.1, 2.11 and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
The following problems have been observed by various third party 3270 emulation 
products when being used with SNA Server:

<OL><P><LI>A User is allowed to open multiple instances of same pool
<P>
   When you assign a single pooled 3270 LU to a user or group using the SNA
   Server Administrator program or SNA Server Manager, the 3270 emulator being
   used should not allow the user to open multiple sessions through a single
   instance of the pool. However, in some cases it does allow the user to open
   multiple instances of the pool.
<P>
   This problem has been observed with some third-party emulators that do not
   closely follow the SNA Server 3270 Emulator Interface Specification. SNA
   Server does not prevent the emulator from attempting to open multiple
   instances of a single pooled LU, because the client may be communicating
   through multiple SNA Servers.
<P>
   To grant access to multiple pooled sessions, the administrator must grant
   multiple instances of a pooled LU to the user or group.
<P>
   The following products are known to exhibit this problem:
<P>
   - IBM Personal Communications/3270 v4.0 (fix available from IBM)
<P>
   - Attachmate Extra! Personal Client v6.1 (32-bit)

<P><LI>A User is allowed to manually enter a 3270 LU or pool to open
<P>
   Some emulators allow the user to manually configure the 3270 LU name or pool
   name for a user to open. However, this circumvents the User/Group/Workstation
   3270 LU assignments configured on the SNA Server. While a user will not be
   allowed to open an LU that they do not have access to on the server, the
   emulator should only display a list of LU's assigned to the user (which the
   emulator retrieves by calling the sepdcrec() SNA client API function).
<P>
</OL><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
The following describes issue #2 in more detail:
<P>
The administrator grants access to 3270 LU's to users or groups.
<P>
In SNA Server Admin (2.x) or Manager (3.x) you may have the following
configured, for example:
<P>
LU Pool:
<UL><LI>3270POOL: 3270 LU pool name
<LI>contains multiple 3270 LU's of same type, from multiple connections
   and/or servers
<P>
</UL>NTDOMAIN\Domain Users
<PRE>   Session 1: 3270POOL

</PRE></OL>NTDOMAIN\JohnDoe
<PRE>   Session 1: 3270POOL
   Session 2: 3270POOL
   Session 3: 3270POOL

</PRE>In the above configuration example, a single instance of "3270POOL" is
granted to the Domain Users group, while three instances of "3270POOL
are granted to JohnDoe.
<P>
When a 3270 emulator is started, it requests the user's 3270 record by
calling the SNA Server client "sepdcrec" function. The SNA client then
returns a data structure (tecwrkus) to the 3270 emulator (documented in
the "SNA Server Emulator Interface Guide," Chapter 6: "Configuration
Information"), including:
<P>
- list of 3270 LUs assigned to the user or group (cwsesdat[10] and
<PRE>  cwremap[] list)
</PRE>- maximum number of active sessions to allow (cwmaxses)
- number of sessions for this user (cwnumrec)
<P>
If JohnDoe starts a 3270 session, the SNA client returns three instances of
"3270POOL" to the 3270 emulator (even if JohnDoe is a member of the Domain
Users group). The emulator should allow up to three instances of "3270POOL"
to be opened, but no more.
<P>
If a user is a member of the Domain Users group, and a 3270 session is
started, the SNA client returns a single instance of "3270POOL" to the 3270
emulator. The emulator should only allow a single instance of the pool to
be opened by the user.
