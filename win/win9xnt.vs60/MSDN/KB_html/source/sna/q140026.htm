The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, version 2.11
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
When you run a 32-bit Windows APPC application on an SNA Server Windows NT
client, the following symptoms occur:
<P>
NOTE: These symptoms do not occur when you run the application on the SNA
server.

<UL><LI>A transaction program name of SASRMT is registered as an autostarted
   invokable transaction program (with a service type of 0x05). An incoming
   attach is received which starts up the application.

<LI>This application then issues a RECEIVE_ALLOCATE on the SASTP62 TP
   name, which is configured as a queued operator started transaction
   program (with a service type of 0x1A). However, this receive allocate
   hangs indefinitely.
<P>
</UL>The SNA Server receives the attach request on the SASTP62 name, though it
is never routed to the Windows NT client computer.
<P>
This problem does not occur with autostarted invokable transaction
programs.
<P>
NOTE: It is possible to configure a Timeout value for the invokable
transaction program within the Windows NT registry (for Win32 applications)
or WIN.INI (for Win 3.x applications) so that the RECEIVE_ALLOCATE does not
wait forever. See the SNA Server APPC and CPIC Programmer's Guide, Chapter
2 for information about the Timeout parameter.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The SNA Server Windows NT client does not promptly notify SNA Server that
the operator started transaction program was started. When the attach
request arrives at the SNA Server from the remote system, the server does
not know which client to route the request to.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
Install the latest SNA Server U.S. Service Pack.
<P>
An update to the SNA Server Windows NT client software corrects this
problem by reducing the time to send service table updates.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 2.11. A fix to
this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may
be destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support
Services for more information on the availability of this fix.
