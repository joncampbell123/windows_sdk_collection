<P>
This article only applies to double byte character set (DBCS) code pages.
DBCS code pages include:
<P>
<PRE>   290 Japanese (Katakana)
   930 Japanese (Extend Katakana)
   931 Japanese (English-lower)
   933 Korean
   935 Chinese (PRC)
   937 Chinese (Taiwan)
   939 Japanese (Extend English)

<OL><P><LI>DBCS Characters Incorrect and Multiple Sessions Fail.
<P>
</OL><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
DBCS characters do not print correctly in both LU1 and LU3 datastreams,
and a Dr. Watson log is generated whenever multiple print sessions are
activated.

<UL><LI>DBCS characters are not printed correctly in LU3. ShiftOut(0x0E) and
   ShiftIn(0x0F) are not handled correctly. These codes mark the beginning
   and end of DBCS data. Because these codes are not recognized, DBCS
   characters between SO(0x0E) and SI(0x0F) are printed as two single byte
   character set (SBCS) characters.

<LI>Dr.Watson errors appear on activations of multiple printer sessions. If
   only one DBCS code page session is activated, the problem does not
   occur. However, if two or more DBCS code page sessions are activated, a
   Dr. Watson error occurs.

<LI>DBCS characters are not printed correctly in LU1. If DBCS data
   containing one or more control codes (NL, CR, LF, BS, and so on) is
   sent, the DBCS data is printed incorrectly.
<P>
</UL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve these problems, obtain the hotfix mentioned in the STATUS
section of this article.

<OL><P><LI>Multiple Fixes for DBCS SCS Printing.
<P>
</OL><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
There were multiple problems found in DBCS SCS printing. The following
problems were reported:
<P>
<PRE>   a. When the margin is set in the Printing tab of the Printer Session
      Properties Printing tab, the position of the grid line is incorrect.

   b. The grid line is incorrect on some control codes.

   c. The automatic line feed (LF) is not performed. This automatic LF is
      a special function for the grid handling (for DBCS code page only).

   d. "-R" is not returned on incomplete Set Attribute (SA) Datastreams.

         Complete SA format:
            DBCS: 0x'2843xx'
            Grid: 0x'28C2xx'
         Incomplete SA:
            The data chain ends with 0x'28' or 0x'2843' or 0x'28C2'.

   e. New line (NL) is not performed after Maximum Presentation Position
      (MPP).

   f. NUL control code is printed.

</PRE></OL><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To resolve these problems, obtain the hotfix mentioned in the STATUS
section of this article. With the hotfix:
<P>
<PRE>   a. The printing position of the grid was adjusted for the margin.

   b. The grid handling after some control codes(NL, CR, LF, BS, and so
      on) was modified.

   c. The automatic LF process for the grid has been corrected.

   d. For the incomplete SA format, -R is set at the end of the data
      chain.

   e. The NL process for MPP has been corrected.

   f. The NUL character was translated to space.

</PRE><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
