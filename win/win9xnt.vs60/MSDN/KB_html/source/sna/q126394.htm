The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1,
   and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
SNA Server is not bundled with an emulator that supports the Windows HLLAPI
application program interface (API), though the SNA Server 2.0 and 2.1
compact disc does include the WOSA-compliant Windows HLLAPI specification
and library/header files necessary to build an HLLAPI application.
<P>
However, under SNA Server 2.11 and later, the Windows HLLAPI API
specification, help file, header and library files have been removed from
the \SDK directory tree located on the SNA Server product compact disc.
<P>
Developers who want to write to the Windows HLLAPI standard are now
referred to third-party vendors for the SDK and runtime HLLAPI support.
The vendors who implement the Windows HLLAPI API on top of their 3270
and 5250 emulation products are indicated in the SNA Server third-party
companion product guide which is included with SNA Server. A column in
the guide indicates whether the third-party emulation product includes
"WinHLLAPI" support.
<P>
If you require Windows HLLAPI support for your application, obtain a third-
party product which supports Windows HLLAPI. Most Windows 3270 and 5250
vendors include Windows HLLAPI support. Refer to the SNA Server Companion
Product Catalog (Word for Windows format) for information on emulators that
support Windows HLLAPI. The Companion Product Catalog can be found in the
following locations:

<UL><LI>SNA Server CD-ROM in COLLATRL\GENERAL\ISVCATAL.DOC for
<PRE>   SNA Server versions 2.0 and 2.1 and in   COLLATRL\3RDPARTY\ISVCATAL.DOC
   for SNA Server versions 2.11   and later.
