The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11sp1,
   and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
If you are using a Windows third-party emulator to use with SNA Server for
Windows NT, the following files are required.
<P>
SNA Server client files, located in the &lt;snaroot&gt; directory:
<P>
<PRE>   WNAP.EXE - SNA Windows client (required)
   WPOPUP.EXE - Displays pop-ups if errors occur (required)
   SNAVER.EXE - Displays version of SNA Server client components
   WSHOWMEM.EXE - Displays internal memory tables and settings used by
      the SNA Server client software (for diagnostic purposes only)

</PRE>SNA Server client DLLs required to run over NetWare:
<P>
<PRE>   NWCLI.DLL - SNA client interface for NetWare
   NWNETAPI.DLL - NetWare API interface
   NWIPXSPX.DLL - NetWare IPX/SPX interface

</PRE>SNA Server client DLL to run over LAN Manager or Windows for Workgroups:
<P>
<PRE>   LMCLI.DLL - SNA client interface for LAN Manager/Windows for Workgroups

</PRE>Other SNA Server client DLLs:
<P>
<PRE>   WDMOD.DLL - SNA client interface used by WNAP, SNA APIs and
      third-party vendors using the Emulator Interface Specification (EIS)
      (required)
   WLOGTR.DLL - Required for logging and trace formatting (required)
   TOOLHELP.DLL - Used by WNAP to determine if an SNA Server client
      application has ended (required)
   WINTRC.DLL - Used only when message tracing is enabled (for debugging
      use only)
   CTL3D.DLL - Required by SNAVER; also used by 3270 and 5250 applets
      for 3-D support
   YMGR.DLL - Yield manager, only used by earlier applications written to
      use the DCA/Microsoft Comm Server APPC interface

</PRE>Used by 5250 emulation vendors:
<P>
<PRE>   WINAPPC.DLL - APPC API support (transaction verbs; see Chapter 4 in
      the APPC Programmer's Guide)
   WINCSV.DLL - Common Service Verbs API support

</PRE>Other SNA API interface DLLs (used only when an SNA application has been
written to use these interfaces):
<P>
<PRE>   WINSLI.DLL - LUA Session Level Interface API support
   WINRUI.DLL - LUA Request Unit Interface API support
   WINCPIC.DLL - CPI-C API support
   WINMGT.DLL - APPC Management Verb API support (see Chapter 3 in APPC
      Programmers Guide)

</PRE>(NOTE: All these .DLLs belong in the &lt;winroot&gt;\system directory.)
<P>
You must add the SNA client directory to the path in AUTOEXEC.BAT or put
the files in a known path.
<P>
You also need to add the following entries in the WIN.INI file of each
workstation:
<P>
<PRE>   [Wnap]
   WBinPath=(SNA Server client root directory, where *.EXEs are located)
   Remote=(For NetWare, this must be set to the domain name where SNA
      Server is running. For LAN Manager/Windows for Workgroups, this is
      optional, though must be set to the SNA Server machine name if the
      client is located in a different domain than the server, or is
      located remotely from the server).
   NosType=(Type of Network)  [ LANMAN | NETWARE ]
   NosSetup=(Type of client)  [ LANMAN | WFW | NETWARE ]
   NetSetup=NO
