The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, version 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
 
<P>
TN5250 clients that are connecting to an SNA Server that has connections
to multiple AS/400s cannot specify which AS/400 to connect to.
<P>
<P><h2>CAUSE</h2>
 
<P>
The TN5250 RFC (RFC 1205) does not include a specification that would
allow TN5250 clients to specify an AS/400 to connect to. Therefore, the
TN5250 service included with SNA Server 3.0 was not designed to support
a mechanism that would allow TN5250 clients to connect to a specific
AS/400.
<P>
<P><h2>RESOLUTION</h2>
 
<P>
To work around this problem:

<OL><P><LI>Set up multiple computers running SNA Server and running the TN5250
   service. Each one must have a connection to a different AS/400.

<P><LI>Configure the TN5250 client(s) to connect to the TCP/IP Address or Host
   Name of the computer running SNA Server that has a connection to the
   AS/400 that the client(s) wants to connect to.
<P>
</OL>NOTE: Only one instance of the TN5250 Server service can be used on a
computer running SNA Server. To support this resolution, multiple computers
running SNA Server must be used, each running a different TN5250 Server
service.
<P>
<P><h2>STATUS</h2>
 
<P>
Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
