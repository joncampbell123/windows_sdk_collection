The information in this article applies to:

<UL><LI>Microsoft SNA Server for Windows NT, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, and 3.0
</UL> 
<P>
<P><h2>SUMMARY</h2>
 
<P>
SNA Server supports the ability to report an user's 3270 response time data
to NetView, using standard NetView Response Time Monitor (RTM) Network
Management vector data messages. This article documents the configuration
options that determine when RTM data is reported to NetView.
<P>
When you configure 3270 Response Time Monitor (RTM) data in SNA Server
Admin under Options and RTM Triggers, the option states the following:
<P>
<PRE>   RTM Data Sent at:

   Select one or both of the following:

   Counter Overflow: To cause RTM data to be sent to the host when the
   number of host responses in a given time period overflows the size of
   the available counter, select this check box.

   End of Session: To cause RTM data to be sent to the host at the end of
   each LU-to-LU session, select this check box.

</PRE>NOTE: It is recommended that you always choose the Counter Overflow method.
If this is not chosen, RTM counters may "wrap" and may cause the reported
data to be inaccurate.
<P>
<P><h2>MORE INFORMATION</h2>
 
<P>
When the connection activates and the host is configured for RTM, the host
sends NMVT major vector '8080' on the SSCP-PU session. This major vector
includes subvector 92 (RTM Request) and optionally, subvector 94 (RTM
Control). Subvector 94 indicates how RTM should be measured, when the PU
should send RTM data, and the boundaries for measurement.
<P>
In some cases the host may send the RTM major vector and subvector 92, but
not send subvector 94. In such instances, SNA Server uses the values
defined in the "RTM Triggers" dialog box to determine how RTM should be
handled. Any values indicated in the host subvector 94 will override the
settings in SNA Admin.
<P>
The IBM SNA “Formats Guide” states that RTM Data subvector 93 is used to
report RTM data. The counter overflow is the number of times that the
maximum boundary of 65,535 is reached.
<P>
Four sets of counters for RTM data are used to measure RTM. Each of these
may be incremented 65,535 times before the counter overflows. These sets
are defined as ranges that may be set in increments of 0.1 seconds (for
example, 0-0.5; 0.5-1.0; 1.0-1.5; 1.5-2.0). If a count would cause the
maximum boundary for a set to overflow, and the SNA Server is configured to
send RTM Data upon Counter Overflow, it will send an unsolicited NMVT with
all the current counts, then initialize the sets.
<P>
If the RTM data is set to be sent at the end of the session, the SNA Server
will not forward the counts except in response to a request from the host
or at the end of the session. In this case, you cannot tell whether a
particular counter set has overflowed, so counts will not reflect the
number of times the sets have been initialized.
<P>
