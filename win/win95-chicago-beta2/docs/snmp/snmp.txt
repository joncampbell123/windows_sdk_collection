========================================================

The SNMP service for this milestone of Windows Chicago is 
installed when you install the TCP/IP protocol stack. 
The service includes an SNMP Agent and the Internet MIB
Extension Agent. Use the control panel to install and 
configure the TCPIP service.

The SNMP Service places its configuration information
in the Registry. In this milestone, to configure the SNMP Service 
you need to use RegEd.Exe, the Registry Editor program. The 
configuration keys in the Registry for the Extensible Agent 
are under:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SNMP\Parameters
and for the Internet MIB Extension Agent are under:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\RFC1156Agent\CurrentVersion

When you install the SNMP service it adds the following files to your
<windir>\system directory

snmp.exe     -- The SNMP agent service
inetmib2.dll -- MIB II extension agent DLL

To start the SNMP Service, simply run the snmp.exe.

If you are developing an extension agent DLL, you must configure
the registry so that the SNMP agent will load the extension agent
DLL.  You can use the RegEd.EXE program that comes with Windows Chicago
to add this information.  As stated above, SNMP configuration is found in
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SNMP\Parameters.
You will need to add another entry under the ExtensionAgents Key.  Simply
follow the same format that you see for the Internet extension agent DLL--
that is provide a pointer to another registry entry that contains the 
physical path where the DLL can be found.  NOTE: the key name and values
are case sensitive.  Make sure that they match.

You must stop and restart the SNMP service for it to load the new
extension agent DLLs.
