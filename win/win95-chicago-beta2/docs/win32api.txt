The following is an explanation of the contents of the Win32api.csv file

Column #1: The API, message, style or macro name.
Column #2: Does this API function in Chicago? (Yes or No)
Column #3: Where this API first appeared.  "Win32s" means you can 
		find it in Win32s 1.1, "Win32" means it first appeared
		new in Windows NT 3.1, or "Chicago" means that this is 
		a new API which first appeared in Chicago.
Column #4: System Section.  This lets you sort the spreadsheet by section, 
		such as "Kernel", "GDI" or "USER".
Column #5: When will this appear in Chicago (if it is implemented in Chicago).  
		"PDK-1" is the August alpha. "PDK-2" is the November alpha 
		and "Beta-1" is the first Chicago beta.
Column #6: Differences from Windows NT.  Most of this information is covered 
		in the Win32 overview help file, but this lets you quickly 
		look for APIs, messages or styles which behave differently 
		between Chicago and Windows NT.
Column #7: History.  "Widened" means it was a Windows 3.1 16-bit API widened 
		to 32-bits for Win32s; "New" means it was new for either 
		Windows NT or Chicago.
Column #8: Does this API exist in both ANSI and Unicode forms in Windows NT? 
		("Y" or "N"). This does not apply to Chicago since Chicago 
		does not support any of the Unicode entry points.
