If you use VC++ 2.0 (32 bit)
============================
One component of the "Chicago Pre-release #2" version of Visual C++ 2.0 has been 
updated to work with this updated release of Chicago.  This file, DMN0.DLL, can be found 
on the Chicago SDK CDROM in the \SDK\VCPATCH directory.  This file should be copied over 
the existing DMN0.DLL found in the \MSVC20\BIN directory on your local hard drive.

If you use the 16bit version of MSVC
====================================
In addition, the Visual C++ 1.5 linker has been updated in order to be compatible with 
this updated release of Chicago.  The file, LINK.EXE, can be found on the Chicago SDK 
CDROM in the \SDK\VCPATCH directory and should be copied over the existing LINK.EXE 
found in the \MSVC\BIN directory on your local hard drive.
