Sample: Demonstration of the Console API Functions

Summary:

The CONSOLE sample demonstrates most of the Win32 console
API functions. The program takes no parameters; to start,
just run CONSOLE.EXE. After starting the sample, you can
click on one of the functions on the screen to get a
demonstration of that function. When viewing a demo of the
function, the title of the console window is changed to show
the name of the source file where that demo function
resides. This should make it easy to find the sample code
where the function of interest resides.

Please note that this sample was developed as some of the
newer console functions were being introduced; as a result,
there may be a few console functions that are not listed or
demonstrated.
