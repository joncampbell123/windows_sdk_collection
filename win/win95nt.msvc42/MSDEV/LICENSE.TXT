SOFTWARE PRODUCT LICENSE
The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by copyright laws and
international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual
property laws and treaties. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is licensed, not
sold.

1.  GRANT OF LICENSE. Microsoft grants to you as an individual a
personal, nonexclusive, limited license to make and use copies of
the SOFTWARE in the manner provided below. If you are an entity,
Microsoft grants to you the right to designate one individual
within your organization to have the right to use the SOFTWARE in
the manner provided below. Microsoft reserves all rights not
expressly granted to you.
    a.  Software Product. The SOFTWARE comprises four software
programs, each a "COMPONENT," and individually identified as
Microsoft Visual C++ version 1.52 ("Version 1.52"), Microsoft
Visual C++ version 4.1 ("Version 4.1"), Microsoft Visual C++

"Version Components") on up to three computers, to design,
develop, and test software application products for use with
Microsoft Windows(R) or Windows NT(R) ("Application") pursuant
to the terms of this EULA, provided you may install and use no
more than one copy of each Version Component, and you are the
only user of the SOFTWARE. For example, you may install and use
Version 1.52 on one computer, Version 4.1 on another, and
Version 4.2 on the third computer, but you may not install and
use all the Version Components on all three computers. The
Visual SourceSafe COMPONENT may be installed and used on up to
three computers, to manage, design, and develop your
Application, provided you are the only user of the SOFTWARE.
    b.  Electronic Documents. Solely with respect to electronic
documents included with the SOFTWARE, you may make an unlimited
number of copies (either in hardcopy or electronic form),
provided that such copies shall be used only for internal
purposes and are not republished or distributed to any third
party.
    c.  Sample Code and Microsoft Foundation Classes. You may
modify, for purposes of designing, developing and testing your
Application, the source code form of those portions of the
SOFTWARE that are identified: (i) as the Microsoft Foundation
Classes ("MFC"); and (ii) as sample code in the documentation
and/or listed in the following subdirectories located in the
SOFTWARE (collectively, "SAMPLE CODE"):
     Version 1.52     vc152\msvc15\samples
                      vc152\msvc15\mfc\samples
     Version 4.1      vc41\msdev\samples
     Version 4.2      msdev\samples
You may not distribute the SAMPLE CODE or MFC, or any modified
version of the SAMPLE CODE or MFC, in source code form.
    d.  Redistributable Files. Provided that you comply with
Section 1.e (and Section 1.f if applicable), you may reproduce
and distribute the object code version of the following portions
of the SOFTWARE (collectively, the "REDISTRIBUTABLES"):
(i) those portions of the Version 1.52 SOFTWARE that are
identified in the documentation as the VBX Controls; (ii) SAMPLE
CODE (including any modifications you make); (iii) MFC
(including any modifications you make); and (iv) the files
identified in the Redistrb.wri file located in the following
subdirectories:
     Version 1.52     \vc152\msvc15\redist
     Version 4.1      \vc41\msdev\redist
                      \vc41\win32s\redist
     Version 4.2      msdev\redist
For purposes of this section, "modifications" shall mean
enhancements to the functionality of the MFC or Sample Code.
    e.  Redistribution Requirements. You may copy and redistribute
the REDISTRIBUTABLES as described above, provided that (a) you
distribute the REDISTRIBUTABLES only in conjunction with, and as
a part of, your Application; (b) your Application adds
significant and primary functionality to the REDISTRIBUTABLES;
(c) the REDISTRIBUTABLES only operate in conjunction with
Microsoft Windows or Windows NT; (d) you do not permit further
redistribution of the REDISTRIBUTABLES by your end-user
customers; (e) you do not use Microsoft's name, logo, or
trademarks to market your Application; (f) you include a valid
copyright notice on your Application; and (g) you agree to
indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Microsoft from and against
any claims or lawsuits, including attorney's fees, that arise or
result from the use or distribution of your Application.
Notwithstanding subsection (d), you may permit further
redistribution of the REDISTRIBUTABLES by your distributors to
your end-user customers if your distributors only distribute the
REDISTRIBUTABLES in conjunction with, and as part of, your
Application and you and your distributors comply with all other
terms of this EULA.  Contact Microsoft for the applicable
royalties due and other licensing terms for all other uses
and/or distribution of the REDISTRIBUTABLES.
    f.  Microsoft Office Redistributable Components. If you are
developing, for commercial distribution, a general-purpose word-
processing, spreadsheet, or database management software
product, or an integrated work or product suite whose components
include a general-purpose word-processing, spreadsheet, or
database management software product, the files comprising
Microsoft JET database functionality ("JET Files") may not be
used or reproduced with your software product, unless your
product requires your customers to license Microsoft Office for
Windows, or a component of it, in order to operate. The
JET Files subject to this provision are: Msajt200.dll,
Msjt3032.dll, Msrd2x32.dll, Msjter32.dll, Msjint32.dll, and
Dao3032.dll. Note: A product that includes limited word-
processing, spreadsheet, or database components along with other
components that provide significant and primary value, such as
an accounting product with limited spreadsheet capability, is
not considered a "general-purpose" product.
The JET Files may be redistributed, subject to Section 1.d, with
your commercially redistributed product in the event that your
software product is using the JET Files exclusively for
importing or exporting data to the various formats supported by
the JET functionality and included in your software product
(e.g., reading data from and writing data to a single data
source at one time).

2.  UPGRADES. If the SOFTWARE is an upgrade, whether from
Microsoft or another supplier, you may use or transfer the
SOFTWARE only in conjunction with the upgraded product, unless
you destroy the upgraded product. If the SOFTWARE is an upgrade
from a Microsoft product, you may now use that upgraded product
only in accordance with this EULA.

3.  COPYRIGHT. All title and copyrights in and to the SOFTWARE
PRODUCT (including but not limited to any images, photographs,
animations, video, audio, music, text, and "applets" incorporated
into the SOFTWARE PRODUCT), the accompanying printed materials,
and any copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT are owned by Microsoft or
its suppliers. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by copyright
laws and international treaty provisions. Therefore, you must
treat the SOFTWARE PRODUCT like any other copyrighted material

the printed materials accompanying the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

4.  DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS.

Disassembly. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or
disassemble the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, except and only to the extent
that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law
notwithstanding this limitation.
