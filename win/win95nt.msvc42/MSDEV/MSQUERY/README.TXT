These files are for MSQuery.  MSQuery is not installed by the 
Visual C++ setup and is only included on the CD for debugging problems
with ODBC Data sources. No documentation exists other than the online 
help.  To run MSQuery, execute MSQRY32.EXE.

NOTE: If you execute a SQL statement in MSQuery which doesn't return any 
results such as a CREATE TABLE, you will get an "Out of Memory" messagebox which 
can be ignored.
