
 This InstallShield SDK does not carry help files or report files, because
 of space constraints.  The help files can be received in three ways:

 A).  From InstallShield web site:
      http://www.installshield.com/
      Go to 'InstallShield SDK technical updates' and download the latest version
      of SDK, which will include all the nessary help files.

 B).  If you already have old version of InstallShield SDK installed on
      your computer:

      1).  Copy directories (with files) HELPDOCS and SUPPORT to your
           NEW InstallShield SDK installation.
      2).  Create Icon with short cut pointing to following:
           - for Users Guide:
           <path to IS SDK>\SUPPORT\MVIEWER2 <path to IS SDK>\HELPDOCS\USERSGD.MVB
           where <path to IS SDK> points to directory where InstallShield
           SDK is installed.
           e.g. "C:\Program Files\InstallShield\InstallShield SDK"

           - for On line reference Guide:
           <path to IS SDK>\SUPPORT\MVIEWER2 <path to IS SDK>\HELPDOCS\ISSEDOC.MVB
           where <path to IS SDK> points to directory where InstallShield
           SDK is installed.
           e.g. "C:\Program Files\InstallShield\InstallShield SDK"

 C).  If you have access to CD with previous version of MSVC (4.0 or 4.1),
      you can access help files from them.  You need to copy files from
      two directories - HELPDOCS and SUPPORT and create icons for README
      and online reference.  Following are the steps:

      1). From previous MSVC4.x CD ROM, Install InstallShield SDK from
          ISHIELD\DISK1 directory at different location.
      2). Follow directions in B).
