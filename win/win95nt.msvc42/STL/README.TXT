Visual C++ 4.2 now ships a complete C++ Standard Run-time Library.
The Hewlett Packard STL has been superseded with it.

The new C++ Standard Run-time Library will be installed with the other
run-time libraries, please see InfoViewer for more information on 
how to use it.

If you still would like to use the latest version of HP's STL, you can
get a copy from your Visual C++ 4.1 CD or from the following
locations:

World Wide Web (WWW):
http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~musser/stl.html
This Web site has many resources including an online hypertext 
reference and many example programs using STL. This is a very 
extensive site.

FTP:
butler.hpl.hp.com/stl
This FTP site has the latest version of the Hewlett Packard 
implementation of STL as well as the Standard Template Library 
FAQ (frequently asked questions) and some examples.
