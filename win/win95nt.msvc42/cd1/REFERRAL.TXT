We are in the early stages of planning a multimedia CD catalog
of products and services that complement and support Visual C++
world-wide. At this time, we are building a database of the
ISVs, consultants, trainers, and others who may be interested
in participating in this CD catalog, targeted for 1997.

If you offer a product or service that supports Visual C++
that you believe would be attractive to Visual C++ developers,
and you would like to be contacted about participation in our
proposed CD catalog, then please provide the information 
below and return to us via email.
 
Please do not modify the label fields. Please fill in the requested
information after the label field and email the completed form to
msvc@microsoft.com in an email message with subject "CDROM Catalog".

Thank You
