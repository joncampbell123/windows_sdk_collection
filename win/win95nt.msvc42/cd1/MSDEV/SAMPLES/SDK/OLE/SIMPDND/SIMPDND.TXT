file simpdnd.txt -this file is zipped in with simpdnd.zip. This is the
simpdnd/Simple Drag and Drop OLE2 SDK sample program ported to work with
Windows 95 ANSI-only functions, and OLE2 UNICODE-only functions. All the files
used by the build are here, even the ones I didn't change. It builds under
Daytona 585, DEBUG=1 and DEBUG=0 without errors or warnings.

The OLE2UI lib Insert object dialog doesn't work, so you can't insert any
objects. So there's no objects to drag or drop.
 
Build instructions:

You must have the Daytona 585 includes and libs first in your include and lib
environment variables, and preferably nothing else. 

To build from the command prompt, cd to the simpdnd directory.
To do a WIN32 debug build,     nmake /a 
To do a WIN32 non-debug build, nmake /a DEBUG=0
