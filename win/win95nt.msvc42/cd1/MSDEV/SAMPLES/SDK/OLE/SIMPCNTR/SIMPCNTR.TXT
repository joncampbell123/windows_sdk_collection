file simpcntr.txt -this file is zipped in with simpcntr.zip. This is the
simpcntr/Simple Container OLE2 SDK sample program ported to work with
Windows 95 ANSI-only functions, and OLE2 UNICODE-only functions. All the files
used by the build are here, even the ones I didn't change. It builds under
Daytona 585, DEBUG=1 and DEBUG=0 without errors or warnings.

The OLE2UI lib Insert object dialog doesn't work, so you can't insert any
objects. That's about all the app is supposed to do, so it doesn't do much.


Build instructions:

You must have the Daytona 585 includes and libs first in your include and lib
environment variables, and preferably nothing else. 

To build from the command prompt, cd to the simpcntr directory.
To do a WIN32 debug build,     nmake /a 
To do a WIN32 non-debug build, nmake /a DEBUG=0
