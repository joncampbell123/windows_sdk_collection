@rem Abstract:
@rem   This is the command script responsible for the fresh mirror test.
@rem   This script performs the following:
@rem     - runs smash.exe to enable the autologon featuren
@rem     - calls getdat.cmd to get the ft componet info  
@rem     - calls scendat.cmd to get the name of the logfile
@rem     - performs some tests
@rem     - copies the next do<testname>.* script to donext.
@rem     - runs the delete.mst script to remove the remaining partitions of the
@rem       mirror.  The system will reboot with donext copied to do.cmd.
