			MIPS Platform Support


The Microsoft Foundation Classes for Windows NT (MFC 2.1) provide
limited support for Windows NT running on the MIPS platform.  This
support is provided as-is for customers who want to compile their
applications on MIPS machines.


Tools
-----
Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows NT does not include tools or
support for the MIPS platform.  In order to compile for MIPS, the 
Windows NT SDK is required.


Building the Libraries
----------------------
MIPS versions of the libraries are not provided.  To build them, 
follow the directions in MFC\SRC\README.TXT and add 'PLATFORM=MIPS'
to the command line.  For example, to build the Windows, debug
variant for MIPS:

	nmake TARGET=w DEBUG=1 PLATFORM=MIPS

Note: when using nmake from the Windows NT SDK, the target must be
specified in lower case (e.g., TARGET=w).


Building the Samples
--------------------
Each sample includes a MAKEFILE for building with the command line
tools.  These files support the MIPS platform by specifying
'PLATFORM=MIPS' on the command line.  For example, to build a release
variant for MIPS:

	nmake DEBUG=0 PLATFORM=MIPS

The .MAK files in the MFC sample directories are project files for
the Microsoft Visual C++ development system.  These files are for
the Intel platform only; they will not compile on the MIPS platform.


Makefile Changes
----------------
Due to differences in the tools of the Windows NT SDK and Microsoft 
Visual C++, some changes to the application's makefile are required.
For examples, please look for "MIPS" in the MFC\SAMPLES\SAMPLE_.MAK 
file.
