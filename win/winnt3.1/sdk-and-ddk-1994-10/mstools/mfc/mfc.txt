=======================================================================
				   MICROSOFT (R) FOUNDATION CLASSES 
							Version 2.1
=======================================================================

			Multiple Platform Support


The Microsoft Foundation Classes for Windows NT (MFC 2.1) provide
limited support for Windows NT running on platforms other than
Intel.  This support is provided as-is for customers who want to 
compile their applications on non-Intel machines.


Tools
-----
Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows NT does not include tools or
support for the non-Intel platforms.  This Windows NT SDK provides
tools to compile for these platforms, 


Microsoft Foundation Classes
----------------------------
This SDK provides a subset of MFC files that can be used to
upgrade your Microsoft Visual C++ to include support for all the
currently supported platforms.  Simply overlay these files on
your MSVCNT installation, replacing the original files.


Supported Platforms
-------------------
Currently, this version of the Microsoft Foundation Classes supports
the Intel x86, MIPS R4x00, and DEC Alpha AXP platforms.  Please see
the text file for the appropriate platform for more specific information.
Other platforms will be added to this SDK in the future.


Scribble
--------
The Scribble sample is tutorial code for Microsoft Visual C++.
Since the tools needed for the tutorial are only supported on the 
Intel platform, the Scribble sample is not supported on the non-Intel
platforms.  However, this SDK provides new MAKEFILEs for you to 
rebuild Scribble with these tools.


Other non-Intel Platforms
-------------------------
As compilers become available for Windows NT on other platforms,
it is possible that MFC can be used as-is on that platform.  The
library code has been designed to be portable.  However, since MFC
has not been tested on these platforms, compiling for these platforms
is at-your-own-risk.

The following files will require modifications:

MFC\INCLUDE\AFXV_CPU.H:
As shipped, this file contains code for the supported platforms.  For
other platforms, it should be extended with the modifications needed
for compiler or platform specific constructs.  Typically this will
be enabling, disabling, or redefining the items in AFXVER_.H

MFC\SRC\MAKEFILE:
MFC\SAMPLES\SAMPLE_.MAK:
Define a new PLATFORM name, and wherever PLATFORM is used, add a new
section to define the tools and flags appropriately.

Note: The version of nmake shipped with the Windows NT SDK does not
support the full syntax of the version in Microsoft Visual C++.  In
particular, !elsif is not supported.
