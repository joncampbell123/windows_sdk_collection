			DEC Alpha AXP Platform Support


The Microsoft Foundation Classes for Windows NT (MFC 2.1) provide
limited support for Windows NT running on the Alpha AXP platform.
This support is provided as-is for customers who want to compile
their applications on AXP machines.


Tools
-----
Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows NT does not include tools for
the Alpha platform.  In order to compile for Alpha AXP, the Windows
NT SDK is required.


Building the Libraries
----------------------
Alpha AXP versions of the libraries are provided.  To re-build them
from source,  follow the directions in MFC\SRC\README.TXT and add
'PLATFORM=ALPHA' to the command line.  For example, to build the
Windows, debug variant for Alpha AXP:

	nmake TARGET=w DEBUG=1 PLATFORM=ALPHA

Note: when using nmake from the Windows NT SDK, the target must be
specified in lower case (e.g., TARGET=w).


Building the Samples
--------------------
Each sample includes a MAKEFILE for building with the command line
tools.  These files support the Alpha AXP platform by specifying
'PLATFORM=ALPHA' on the command line.  For example, to build a release
variant for Alpha AXP:

	nmake DEBUG=0 PLATFORM=ALPHA

The .MAK files in the MFC sample directories are project files for
the Microsoft Visual C++ development system.  These files are for
the Intel platform only; they will not compile on the Alpha AXP
platform (with the exception of the scribble sample, see below).


Makefile Changes
----------------
Due to differences in the tools of the Windows NT SDK and Microsoft 
Visual C++, some changes to the application's makefile are required.
For examples, please look for "ALPHA" in the MFC\SAMPLES\SAMPLE_.MAK 
file.
