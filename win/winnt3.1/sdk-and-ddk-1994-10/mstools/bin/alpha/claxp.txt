                       CLAXP Compiler Specifications

			     10 September 1993


     This document presents the specifications for the CLAXP compiler
     on Windows NT for Alpha AXP.  This compiler is also referred to
     as the MSCGEM or GEM compiler, identifying the frontend as a port
     of the Microsoft C frontend, and the backend as a port of the GEM
     backend used in Digital's production compilers on other Alpha AXP
     platforms.  The CLAXP compiler is highly compatible with the
     Microsoft C and C++ compilers on Windows NT for x86 and Windows
     NT for MIPS platforms.  Accordingly, this document describes the
     CLAXP compiler primarily in terms of its differences from the x86
     compiler in particular.  (See the "Tools", "C Language
     Reference", and "C++ Language Reference" books in the Microsoft
     Win32 Software Development Kit for Windows NT, July 1992 and
     October 1992.)


     The CLAXP compiler consists of three major components:

           .  A  Microsoft  frontend  that  performs   syntactic   and
              semantic  processing and writes it's results to a set of
              intermediate  language  (IL)  files.   The  frontend  is
              sometimes  informally  referred to as the P1 part of the
              compiler.  There are separate frontends for C and C++.

           .  A  Digital  backend  that  itself  has  two  parts:    a
              translator that converts the Microsoft IL to GEM IL, and
              the GEM backend that completes the compilation to object
              module   form.   The  backend  is  sometimes  informally
              referred to as the P2 part of the compiler.  There is  a
              common backend for C and C++.

           .  A Microsoft driver that implements  the  CLAXP  command,
              processes  command  options and invokes the frontend and
              backend transparently.  There is a common driver  for  C
              and C++.

     The Microsoft frontend and driver have generally been modified as
     little as possible consistent with porting them to the Alpha AXP
     environment and adding the few AXP specific features and options
     that are described here.


     A Quick Comparison

     There are just a few language related aspects of CLAXP  that  are
     known  to  differ  compared  to  the "C8" compiler in Visual C++.


     Compared to the CL386 compiler:

           .  CLAXP handles type 'long double' as  a  64-bit  floating
              point type (rather than an 80-bit type).

           .  CLAXP does not support any kind of asm statement.

           .  Various predefined macros are adjusted to be appropriate
              to the Alpha AXP environment.

           .  CLAXP does not support P-Code.

	   .  CLAXP does not produce assembler source files (it does
              produce assembly listings with assembled code bytes).


     CLAXP adds these Alpha AXP specific characteristics:

           .  64-bit integer support.

           .  Several hardware specific intrinsic functions.


     CLAXP adds support for these known C8 features:

           .  structured exception handling

           .  __unaligned type qualifier

	   .  Thread Local Storage


     1  CLAXP COMMAND OPTIONS

     The CLAXP command invokes the Microsoft C frontend, Digital's GEM
     backend, and optionally the linker.


     The next section describes the options that are supported by the
     CLAXP command.  For a description of these options, see Chapter 1
     in the "Tools User's Guides" for the Win32 SDK.    The following
     section includes additional notes regarding options that are new
     or different compared to that document.

     1.2  Supplementary Notes

     The following sections contain notes on selected options that
     deserve  further  discussion  as they are new to Microsoft C
     (since C7) and/or have some slight variation for the Alpha
     AXP  platform.


     1.2.1 /Fa, /FA, /Fc And /Fl - Microsoft has extended the C7 /Fa,
     /Fc, /Fl assembly listing functionality by deprecating /Fc and /Fl,
     and adding /FA*.  The idea is that /Fa names the assembly listing
     file, and /FA describes what should be in it in addition to the
     basic assembly text.


     /FA takes a string argument, which may contain the  letters  'a',
     'c', or 's'.

     'a'     turns on assembler  code  representation;  it  is  always
             implied and is thus a no-op.

     'c'     turns on code-bytes, and causes the default extension  to
             be .COD instead of .ASM.

     's'     turns on source code.

     CLAXP does not produce an assemblable listing -- only options
     that create a .COD file are valid.  In effect, the default is
     .COD because that is the only form of listing supported.


     While /Fc and /Fl are still silently accepted, they aren't  being
     documented.  Comparison of old and new formats:

             old             new
             ---             ---
             /Fa             /FA and/or /Fa
             /Fc             /FAcs (with or without /Fa)
             /Fl             /FAc  (with or without /Fa)
             /Fa<file>       /Fa<file> (with or without /FA)
             /Fc<file>       /Fa<file> /FAcs
             /Fl<file>       /Fa<file> /FAs

     The overrides are set up in such a way that /Fc, /Fl and /FA  are
     mutually overriding, as are /Fc /Fl and /Fa, while /Fa and /FA do
     not override.


     An alternative description for  CLAXP  presents  the  options  in
     these groups:

         Option              Interpretation
         ------              --------------

     Group 1:

         /Fa                 Unsupported, but treated as if /FAc specified
         /Fa<file>           Unsupported, but treated as if /FAc specified
         /Fc                 Undocumented, but equivalent to /Fa /FAc
         /Fc<file>           Undocumented, but equivalent to /Fa<file> /FAc
         /Fl                 Undocumented, but equivalent to /Fa /FAcs
         /Fl<file>           Undocumented, but equivalent to /Fa<file> /FAcs


     Group 2:

         /FA                 Unsupported (same as /FAa), but forced to /FAc
         /FAa                Unsupported (.ASM), but forced to /FAc (.COD)
         /FAc  or /FAac      Create listing with code bytes (.COD)
         /FAcs or /FAacs     Create listing with code bytes and source (.COD)
         /FAs  or /FAas      Unsupported (same as /FAas), but forced to /FAcs

     Group 3:

         /Fa or /Fa<file> can be added in combination with any of the
         Group 2 options. The effect is only to determine the name of
         the file created. Whether the requested file can be created or
         not is determined solely by the associated /FA form. As noted
         above, the erroneous forms requesting a .ASM file are forced
         to request a .COD file with code bytes.  So while

             /Fa /FAs
             /Fa<file> /FA

         specify .ASM files, they are treated as if they were written

             /Fa /FAcs
             /Fa<file> /FAc

         respectively.



     1.2.2 /Gs - CLAXP supports the /Gs option to turn-off stack limit
     checking, but does not support the form /Gs{num} to specify the
     stack-limit checking value.  In particular, use /Ge to enable
     stack limit checking (the default), not /Gs0.


     When stack limit checking is enabled, it is assumed that there
     may only be a single guard page for a thread.  For the Alpha AXP
     architecture, a hardware page may have a size of 8, 16, 32 or 64K
     bytes, depending on the implementation.  The CLAXP stack checking
     logic is thus based on the minimum allowed page size of 8K bytes.



     1.2.3 /Gt - /Gt specifies the maximum size of data objects that
     can be included in the shared global section.  Such objects can
     be addressed using faster code sequences because they are
     addressed relative to a fixed global pointer (which is always
     available in the Alpha AXP register R29).


     A global section can only be used in a main program.  Object
     modules that are included in a DLL (dynamic-link library) can
     neither use nor modify the global pointer register established
     for the main program.  Such modules must be compiled using /Gt0
     (which is the default).  Object modules that define initialized
     storage for global variables and are linked into an executable
     image rather than a DLL must generally be compiled with a /Gt
     value at least as large as the /Gt value used when compiling
     modules that refer to the global data.  For this reason,
     compiling even with very small non-zero /Gt can sometimes cause
     link errors when linking with object module libraries rather than
     DLL's (e.g.  if the library was compiled with /Gt0).


     At most 64K bytes of object storage can be allocated in the
     global section.  If more that this amount of storage is detected
     during linking, then some of the modules involved must be
     re-compiled using a smaller threshold, typically /Gt0.  It
     follows that no single object module can require more than 64K
     bytes by itself; this error is detected during compilation.



     1.2.4 /FI - There is a new option to allow a file to be prepended
     at the beginning of a compilation (without needing to add an
     #include directive at the beginning of the source). The option
     syntax is

         /FI{filename}

     The given file is included in the compilation prior to the  first
     line.  Multiple /FI options are allowed.



     1.2.5 /Op And /Op- - The /Op- option indicates that the CLAXP
     compiler is allowed to use certain optimizations that favor speed
     at the possible loss of some accuracy.  For example, division of
     a floating-point value by another can be performed using
     multiplication by the inverse of that value.  Similarly, various
     reorderings and transformations of an expression may be
     mathematically equivalent and faster, but may lose some accuracy
     compared to the original formulation.


     The default is /Op.  That is, modules are considered to be
     accuracy sensitive, as required by the ANSI C rules, by default.
     Note that on x86 platforms, the default of /Op- allows the
     compiler to use excess precision when evaluating intermediate
     results, which is allowed by ANSI C rules but can often lead to
     unexpected final results in numeric applications.  So on both
     platforms /Op means to compute floating point values with maximum
     fidelity to the way the source code is written, but the default
     is different since excess precision calculations are allowed by
     ANSI C while reciprocals and other transformations are not.


     1.2.6  /O, /O1, /O2, /Od  And  /Ox - CLAXP  provides  four  basic
     levels of optimization:

     /Od     Perform no optimization.  This choice is  recommended  in
             combination  with the /Zd or /Zi option when debugging is
             intended.  It is the default if /Zi or /Z7 is specified
             and there are no explicit optimization options.

     /O1     Perform  optimizations  that  are  consistent   with
             keeping  the resulting code small.  This implies the /Ob1
             and /Oi- options by default, but these can be overridden.

     /Ox     Perform the optimizations that benefit speed even if  the
             code  requires  somewhat more  space.  For example, loop
             unrolling may occur.  The /Ob1 option is assumed by default
             to give the user more control over inlining,  but this can
             be overridden.  /Oi is also implied.

     /O2     Perform  all   optimizations,   including   automatic
             inlining  by  the  compiler.  /Ob2 is assumed by default,
             but this can be overridden.  /Oi is also implied.


     The default if no explicit optimization option is given is /Ox /Oi-
     unless /Zi or /Z7 is specified (in which case the default is /Od).
     

     /O is equivalent to /O2.


     /Ox and O2 (similarly, /O) include all of the optimizations that
     are implied by the Microsoft /Oc (block subexpression), /Og
     (global subexpression), /Oi (enable intrinsics), /Ol (loop
     optimization), and /Oo (peephole optimization) options in some
     prior C compilers.  However, CLAXP does not allow independent
     control of these optimizations (other than /Oi).

     Note that /Os and /Ot, which express a preferred bias in the
     trade-offs performed for other optimizations, are not supported.



     1.2.7 /Q - Microsoft has selected the /Q option as a means for
     compilers on the various hardware platforms to provide options
     that are not generally common with other Windows NT compilers.
     /QA has been chosen as the common prefix for Alpha/AXP options.


     At present, no such Alpha-specific options are defined.


     1.2.8 /Zh - /Zh directs the compiler to "home" all arguments to
     their canonical location on the stack, just as though each formal
     parameter name had been used in a context where it's address is
     taken (such as the operand of the & operator).  This homing can
     facilitate debugging, even in the absence of symbol table
     information.  /Zh is implied by /Zi or /Z7 if optimization is
     disabled.

     2  CLAXP IMPLEMENTATION-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR

     2.1  Predefined Macros

     In addition to the five predefined macros specified  for  ANSI  C
     (__DATE__,  __FILE__,  __LINE__,  __STDC__,  and  __TIME__),  the
     following macros are predefined in CLAXP:


     Identifier      Function
     -----------------------------------------------------------------
     __Alpha_AXP     Always   defined.     Identifies    the    target
                     architecture as Digital's Alpha AXP architecture.

                                           NOTE

                         The identifiers __alpha  or  __ALPHA  are
                         also   defined   for   this  purpose  for
                         compatibility with the  identifiers  used
                         in  other Digital operating environments.
                         However, __Alpha_AXP is  preferred  where
                         suitable.

     _ALPHA_         Always   defined.     Identifies    the    target
                     architecture  for  use  in  the Windows NT header
                     files.

     _M_ALPHA	     Always defined.  Matches _M_MRX000 and _M_X386
		     on MIPS and Intel platforms.

     _WIN32          Always defined, as it is by the other Microsoft
                     compilers for Win32 platforms.


     The following predefined macros are  also  defined  according  to
     Microsoft conventions:


     Identifier      Function
     -----------------------------------------------------------------

     _MSC_VER        Defines the compiler version in the  form:   ddd.
                     Defined as 800.

     _CHAR_UNSIGNED  Defined only when the /J option is given to  make
                     char unsigned by default.

     __TIMESTAMP__   The date and time of the last modification of the
                     source file.

     __cplusplus__   Reserved by Microsoft to  assist  in  portability
                     between C and C++.

     2.2  Pragmas

     There are no CLAXP-specific pragmas.


     The following Microsoft C pragmas are supported in CLAXP:

	      data_seg
              function
              hdrstop
              intrinsic
              message
              pack
              setlocale
              warning



     The following Microsoft C pragmas are recognized and checked  for
     syntax but are otherwise ignored by CLAXP:

              auto_inline
              check_stack
              code_seg
              comment
              inline_depth, inline_recursion
              linesize, page, pagesize, subtitle, title
              native_caller



     The following Microsoft C pragmas are not recognized and cause  a
     warning message to be printed:

              alloc_text
              check_pointer

     2.3  64-Bit Integer Support

     2.3.1  64-Bit Integer Types - The integral type __int64, in  both
     signed and unsigned forms, is supported.  This type can be freely
     used as any other integral type with these qualifications:

           .  An __int64 object is 64 bits (8 bytes) in size.

           .  An __int64 object is 8-byte aligned by default.


     2.3.2  64-Bit  Constants - No  special  notation  is  needed  for
     for 64-bit integer constants.  The type of a constant integer literal
     is determined by its form and value.  The type of a constant
     expression is then determined by the usual rules of integral promotion
     and the usual arithmetic conversions.  For each form of integer
     literal constant shown below, the type of a constant of that form is
     the first type listed for that form which can correctly represent
     the value of the literal.  The type sequence for each form of literal
     is as follows:


     unsuffixed decimal:
        int, unsigned long int, __int64, unsigned __int64

     unsuffixed hex and octal:
        int, unsigned int, __int64, unsigned __int64

     suffixed by u or U:
        unsigned int, unsigned __int64

     suffixed by l or L:
        long int, unsigned long int, __int64, unsigned __int64

     suffixed by u or U and l or L:
        unsigned long int, unsigned __int64

     No special integer suffix is defined to cause a constant that  is
     representable  as a long or int value to instead be considered an
     __int64 value.  The recommended way to achieve this effect is  to
     use a type cast.  For example:

         #define longlong __int64

         longlong LL = ((longlong) 1) << 53;

     Note that without the type cast, the expression 1 << 53 would  be
     considered undefined by the ANSI C rules since it is shifted by
     an amount greater than the number of bits in an int.



     2.3.3  64-Bit Formatted Input/Output - 64-bit values can be input
     and output using format strings that use 'L' as the prefix to one
     of the following conversion specifiers:

         d, i, o, u, x and X

     For example:

         printf("A big number: %Lx", ((longlong) 1) << 53);

     will output

         A big number: 0020000000000000


     Note that this usage of L is an extension to the ANSI C standard.
     It   provides   a   useful  interpretation  for  combinations  of
     conversion specifiers that are otherwise undefined.   It  follows
     that  use  of  L  in  this  way  may  not  be  portable  to other
     environments.  (The standard defined usage of L as a prefix to e,
     E, f, g and G is not affected.)

     The C libraries also support the conversion functions strtoq and
     strtouq.
     

     2.3.4  Special Considerations - The following restrictions  apply
     to the use of 64-bit values:

           .  The constant expression of an array declarator must  not
              be of type __int64 (either signed or unsigned).

           .  The constant expression of a case label must not  be  of
              type __int64 (either signed or unsigned).



     2.4  Intrinsic Functions

     In the function descriptions below,  assume  that  the  following
     type definitions apply:

             typedef signed   __int64    int64;
             typedef unsigned __int64   uint64;



     CLAXP supports the following intrinsic functions.   All  of  them
     correspond   one-for-one   with   corresponding  instructions  or
     PALcalls in the Alpha AXP architecture.




     Unsigned Quadword Multiply High (UMULH)

             uint64 __UMULH(uint64 operand1, uint64 operand2);


     Trap Barrier (TRAPB)

             void __TRAPB(void);


     Read Cycle Counter (RCC)

             unsigned int __RCC(void);


     Halt Processor (HALT)

             void __PAL_HALT(void);


     Generate Trap (GENTRAP)

             void __PAL_GENTRAP(uint64 trap_code);


     Memory Barrier (MB)

             void __MB(void);


     Instruction Memory Barrier

             void __PAL_IMB(void);


     The following intrinsics are intended for  use  in  stdarg.h  and
     varargs.h only:

             int __builtin_isfloat(type-name);

             void * __builtin_va_start(
                        va_list, last-fixed-formal-name, bool);


     The following intrinsic is intended for use in setjmp.h only:

             int _setjmp(jmp_buf buffer);


     CLAXP has intrinsic support to  generate  special  code  for  the
     following Microsoft C functions:

                 _alloca
                 abs         fabs       labs
                 _lrotl      _lrotr     _rotl       _rotr
                 memcpy      memset
                 strcmp      strcpy     strlen



     For the other Microsoft C intrinsics, normal  external  calls  to
     the  standard  library functions are generated whether or not the
     intrinsic forms are enabled by command line options or pragmas.


     3  NEW MICROSOFT C/C++ FEATURES SUPPORTED IN CLAXP

     This section  notes  some new  features  that  have  been  added
     to Microsoft  C/C++  since C7 and  are  not  described in C7
     documentation.  They are further described in the NT and Visual C++
     documentation.


     3.1  __unaligned Type Qualifier


         __unaligned

         Is a qualifier that may be used in the same way as the
         ANSI C "const" and "volatile" qualifiers.  It tells the
         compiler that accesses to memory through an l-value with
         this qualifier on it are not known to be on a properly aligned
         boundary, so the compiler needs to generate somewhat
         longer code to avoid getting an alignment trap at runtime.



     3.2  Structured Exception Handling

     The try/except/finally/leave constructs are supported.


     4  CLAXP IMPLEMENTATION-DEFINED BEHAVIOR

     This section details the CLAXP implementation-defined behavior as
     required  by  the  ANSI  C  Standard,  Appendix  F.3.   Where the
     behavior is defined as the "same as Microsoft C", refer to the "C
     Language Reference Manual", Appendix B (Version 7.0).

     C.

     Uppercase and Lowercase - Same as Microsoft C,  except  that  the
     __pascal options (/Gc and /Zc) do not apply because there is only

     Converting Multibyte Characters - Same as Microsoft C.

     Range of char Values - Same as Microsoft C.


     4.5  Integers

     Range of Integer Values - The integer types of  Microsoft  C  are
     supplemented with these additional integral types:


     Type                        Minimum and Maximum
     -----------------------------------------------------------------

     unsigned __int64            0 to (2^64)-1

     signed __int64              -(2^63) to (2^63)-1

     Demotion of Integers - Same as Microsoft C.  In particular, if an
     __int64  integer  is  cast  to  a  long  (or  an  int), the least
     significant bytes are retained.

     Signed Bitwise Operations - Same as Microsoft C.

     Remainders - Same as Microsoft C.

     Right Shifts - Same as Microsoft C.

     4.6  Floating-Point Math

     double  type  using  the  same  representation as the double type
     (64-bits).

     4.7  Arrays and Pointers

     Largest Array Size - size_t is defined as unsigned int (32 bits).
     However, the constant expression of an array declarator must  not
     be of type __int64 (either signed or unsigned).

     Casting Pointers - sizeof(void *) is 4.  All  pointers  are  this
     size.

     Pointer Subtraction - ptrdiff_t is defined as int (32 bits).


     4.8  Registers

     Availability of Registers - A number of registers are available
     for holding objects with the register storage-class specifier.
     See the "Windows NT for Alpha AXP Calling Standard" for details
     on register usage conventions.  The CLAXP compiler backend
     currently ignores the register storage-class specifier.  The
     frontend does check that the usage conforms to ANSI standard
     (i.e. it is an error to take the address of a register variable).

     4.9  Structures, Unions, Enumerations, and Bit Fields

     Improper Access to a Union - Same as Microsoft C.

     Padding and Alignment of Structure Members - Same as Microsoft C,
     except that the default packing size is 8 (/Zp8).

     Sign of Bit Fields - Same as Microsoft C.  (Plain bit fields  are
     signed.)

     Storage of Bit Fields - Same as Microsoft  C.   (Bit  fields  are
     allocated within a 32-bit integer.)

     Alignment of Bit Fields - Same as Microsoft C.  (Bit  fields  are
     allocated within a four-byte aligned (int sized) frame.)

     Limits on Switch Statements - Same as Microsoft C.  However,  the
     constant  expression  of a case label must not be of type __int64
     (either signed or unsigned).

     C.

     Including Bracketed Filenames - Same as Microsoft C.
