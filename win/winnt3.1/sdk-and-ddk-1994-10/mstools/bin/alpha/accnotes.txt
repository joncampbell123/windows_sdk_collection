ACC NOTES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The acc command accepts several types of arguments:
*	Arguments with names that end with .c are assumed to be C source 
	programs. They are compiled, and each object program is left in the 
	file whose name consists of the last component of the source with .o 
	substituted for .c.

*	Arguments with names that end with .s are assumed to be symbolic 
	assembly language source programs.  They are assembled, producing a .o 
	file.

*	Arguments with names that end with .i are assumed to be C source after 
	being processed by the C preprocessor.  They are compiled without being 
	processed by the C preprocessor.

*	The following suffixes primarily aid compiler development and are not 
	generally used.
	.b	Binary ucode file generated by the frontend.
	.g 	Binary assembly file generated by the code generator.
	.t	Binary symbol table file.


The acc compiler always defines the following preprocesser macros.
	Macro
	const
	LANGUAGE_C
	_LANGUAGE_C
	__alpha
	_LONGLONG
	_CFE
	ACCASM
 

Flags
The following options are interpreted by the acc compiler:
-usejsr
	Generates jsr instructions instead of bsr instructions to call 
	subroutines and functions.  The use of 	this flag is discouraged.
-checkstack value
	Generates a call to the RtlCheckStack() routine when a stack frame 
	contains data larger than the value specified.  The recommended value 
	is 4096.
-c
	Suppress the loading phase of the compilation and force an object 
	file to be produced.  This option is forced by the acc compiler.
-g0
	Do not produce symbol table information for symbolic debugging.  
	This is the default.
-g1
	Produce symbol table information for accurate, but limited, 
	symbolic debugging of partially	optimized code.
-g or -g2
	Produce symbol table information for full symbolic debugging and 
	suppress optimizations that limit full symbolic debugging.
-g3
	Produce symbol table information for full symbolic debugging for 
	fully optimized code.  This option makes the debugger inaccurate.
-w or -w1
	Suppress warning messages.
-w2
	Abort on warnings after printing them as if an error occurred.
-w3
	Do not print warning messages; however, exit with non-zero status 
	when warnings occur.
-O0
	Turn off all optimizations.
-O1
	Turn on all optimizations that can be done quickly.  This is the 
	default.
-O or -O2
	Invoke the global ucode optimizer.
-S
	Compile the specified source programs and leave the symbolic 
	assembly language output in corresponding files with a .s suffix.
-E
	Run the C macro preprocessor and generate the results to standard 
	output.
-Dname=def
-Dname
	Define the name to the C macro preprocessor, as if by #define.  If 
	no definition is given, the name is defined as "1".
-Uname
	Remove any initial definition of name.
-Idir
	This specifies the directory in which to search for #include files.  
	There is no standard default include directory, so the include paths
	must all be specified.
-o output
	Name the final output file output.  If not specified, a file with 
	an extension of .o is generated.
-G num
	The acc compiler forces this value to be 0.
-v
	Print the passes as they execute with their arguments and their 
	input and output files.
-V
	Print the version of the driver and the implicit version of all the 
	passes.  
-std[0,1]
	Have the compiler produce warnings for language constructs that are 
	not standard in the language;
	-std0 enforces the K & R standard with some ANSI extensions, -std1 
	enforces the ANSI C standard, and -std enforces the ANSI C standard 
	with popular extensions. The -std option causes the macro STDC=0 to be 
	passed to the preprocessor, -std1 causes the macro STDC=1 to be passed,
	and -std0 causes STDC to be undefined. The default is -std0. Note that 
	the data types long long and __int64 are not ANSI C and should not be 
	combined with the -std1 switch.
-traditional
	Is the same as the -std0 option.
-Zpn
	Align structure members on alignment specified by the integer n.
-proto[is]
	Extract prototype declarations for function definitions into a .h 
	suffixed file. Use the i option to include identifiers in the prototype 
	and the s option to generate prototypes for static functions.
-nocpp
	Do not run the C macro preprocessor on C and assembly source files 
	before compiling.
-Olimit num
	Specify the maximum size, in basic blocks, of a routine that will 
	be optimized by the global optimizer.  If a routine has more than this 
	number of basic blocks it will not be optimized and a message will be 
	printed. An option specifying that the global optimizer is to be run 
	(-O, or -O2) must also be specified. The num argument must be a decimal 
	number.  The default value for num is 500 basic blocks.
-trapuv
	Force all uninitialized stack, automatic, and dynamically allocated 
	variables to be initialized with 0xfffa5a5afffa5a5a. When this value 
	is used as a floating point variable, it is treated as a floating point 
	NaN and it will cause a floating point trap. When it is used as a 
	pointer, an address or segmentation violation will most likely occur.
-verbose
	This option causes output of the long form of error and warning 
	messages.  These may give the user some hints as to the reason the 
	compilation failed.
-signed
	Cause all char declarations to be signed char declarations.  The 
	default is to treat them as unsigned char declarations.
-float
	Cause the compiler to never promote expressions of type float to 
	type double.
-fptm n
	No floating point trapping modes.
-fptm u
	Trap floating point on underflow.
-fptm su
	Trap floating point on underflow with software completion.
-fptm sui
	Trap floating point on underflow or inexact with software 
	completion.
-scope_safe
	Compiling code with this flag ensures that any trap (such as 
	floating overflow) is reported to have occurred in the procedure or 
	guarded scope that caused the trap.  Any trap occurring outside that 
	scope will not be reported to have occurred in the procedure or 
	guarded scope, with the exception of well-defined trapb instructions 
	following jsr or bsr instructions.
-resumption_safe
	All -scope_safe functionality plus the code generated in trap 
	shadows are restricted so that they are re-executable.
-ieee_with_inexact
	This flag assures full IEEE support. This support consists of 
	setting the -resumption_safe and -fptm sui flags and marking the 
	procedures as IEEE-conformant, so that the math library routines the 
	procedures call will handle denorms, NaNs, and infinities as well as 
	return the correct IEEE default value in error cases. In addition, the 
	cpp macros _IEEE_FP and IEEE_FP_INEXACT are set.
-ieee_with_no_inexact
	This flag is similar to -ieee_with_inexact except that the -fptm su 
	flag is used and the cpp macro _IEEE_FP is not set. This option produces
	faster execution than the -ieee_with_inexact option.
 

Notes
The following options primarily aid compiler development and are not 
generally used:
-Hc
	Halt compiling after the pass specified by the character c, 
	producing an intermediate file for the 	next pass.  The c can be [ 
	fjusmoca ].  The -Hc option selects the compiler pass in the same way 
	as the -t option.  If the -Hc option is used, the name of the 
	symbol table file that is produced remains the same, and the suffix 
	changes to .T.
-K
	Build and use intermediate file names with the last component of 
	the source file's name replacing its suffix with the conventional suffix 
	for the type of file (for example, .b file for binary ucode, 
	produced by the frontend).  These intermediate files are never 
	removed, even when a pass encounters a fatal error. 
	The environment variable TMP is used to determine the location of temporary 
	files.

Diagnostics
The diagnostics produced by the acc compiler are intended to be self-
explanatory.  Occasional messages may be produced by the assembler or 
loader.

Additional Functionality
Since the March 1993 Beta release, the acc compiler has the following 
additional functionality:
1.	The environment variable INCLUDE can be used to specify a list of 
	include paths. The -I flag on the command line has higher precedence 
	(searching order) than the environment variable.
2.  	The keyword __int64 can be used instead of the long long type. This 
	is to ease changing between the acc and claxp compilers.
