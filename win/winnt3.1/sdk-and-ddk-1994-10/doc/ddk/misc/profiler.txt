                    Windows NT Sampling Profiler
                    ----------------------------


The Windows NT sampling profiler is a tool for finding out where you
are spending time in your code.  It supplements the WAP and CAP tools
distributed in the Windows NT SDK, and the kernprof tool distributed
in the DDK.


Usage:
------

Make sure you have a file called "profile.out" located in the root of
the default disk drive.  This is the disk drive which is the current
drive when you execute the following command:

    profile <application>

            <application>   - name of the application you want to
                              measure

Operation:
----------

While the application is running, the profiler wakes up every
millisecond and samples the instruction counter.  The module that is
executing is located.  The bucket corresponding to the nearest public
symbol in the module is located and incremented.

The results of the run are placed in the \profile.out file you
created.  Each symbol with a non-zero count will be printed with its
count.


Hints:
------

Where possible, use CAP instead as it provides more information.


Caveats:
--------

You MUST be running on the checked build of Windows NT to use the
sampling profiler.  The free build does not have symbols for
profiling.  Because the checked build of the system has extra code for
checking, you should ignore the time spent in the system as measured
by the sampling profiler, and focus on the time spent in your
application.

You can measure time in the system on the free build if you first load
the .dll's with symbols provided in the SDK and then use WAP or CAP.
Those .dll's do not provide enough symbols for profiling.
