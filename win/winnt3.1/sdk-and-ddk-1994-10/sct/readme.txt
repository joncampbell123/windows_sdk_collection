Two batch files are included to help you manage the 16-bit debugging
utilities:

remdebug.bat - removes the debug, or checked, version of the 16-bit subsystems.  You should run this before doing any performance measurements.

setdebug.bat - installs the debug version of the 16-bit subsystems.

See the Software Compatibility Test book for more details.
