************  SETUP.TXT  ************

Thank you for purchasing Microsoft Windows NT. To 
give you the greatest possible benefit from this product, 
we've included this detailed set of notes on Windows NT.
We hope you enjoy using this operating system.

Feedback from the thousands of Windows NT beta sites 
has shown that Windows NT Setup proceeds smoothly in 
the vast majority of cases. However, there are cases where 
you may experience difficulties with hardware incompatibilities 
or conflicts. SETUP.TXT contains information that you 
may need in order to install Windows NT or Windows NT 
Advanced Server on some hardware configurations. 
Information applies to both Windows NT and Windows 
NT Advanced Server. 

For more information on installation, see the chapters "Installing 
Windows NT" and "Troubleshooting" in the Windows NT System Guide or 
Windows NT Advanced Server System Guide.

1.0  Removing Previous Versions

If you have installed a pre-release version of Windows NT, you should 
delete it before installing this version. Depending on the release, the
Windows NT Boot Loader may not support booting both this release of the
operating system and a previous release. 

2.0  General Hardware Notes

Windows NT has a very wide range of hardware support -- including 
support for over 1600 x86 uniprocessor systems, over 25 x86 
multiprocessor systems, as well as supporting RISC systems (for 
details please see the Hardware Compatibility List).  To cover a 
few outlying cases, we've included these notes.

2.1  Interrupt Conflicts

A common problem in a computer with several supported devices is 
conflicting interrupts, I/O ports, or memory usage. Where possible, we 
have identified such cases in this document. However, if one of the 
supported devices does not seem to work, it may be due to the 
particular hardware configuration. For more specific information, 
see your hardware manual or contact your system manufacturer.

2.2  ROM Shadowing

If you encounter persistent installation problems on multiprocessor 
systems, try installing with ROM shadowing disabled. 

2.3 Intel EtherExpress 16 LAN Adapter

In some cases, selecting "early" in the I/O Channel Ready box 
can stop the network adapter card from functioning correctly and
may require reconfiguring with the Intel SoftSet utility. If you are
unsure whether your system can take advantage of this network
setting, consult your hardware vendor. 

3.0  Specific Computer Systems

3.1 ACER AcerFrame 3000 MP

Before installing Windows NT, disable shadow RAM Video BIOS.

3.2 IBM Personal System/2

On some IBM PS/2 systems only planar memory is recognized when 
booting from the Windows NT CD-ROM boot disk or Disk #1 of the 
floppy disk installation set. This is a memory card problem. You may 
encounter this problem if your system contains a card with the 
following part numbers:

FRU-88F0075
Option 87F9856 or 87F9860

Newer model cards are available that correct this problem. Part numbers 
for the newer cards are:

FRU-87F9916 or 34F2825
Option 34F3077 or 34F3011

Using Kingston expansion memory can also correct this problem.

It is recommended that before you install Windows NT, you update your 
system configuration using the PS/2 Reference Diskette version 1.21 or 
later

3.3  Installation on the IBM ThinkPad

The IBM ThinkPad 700c and 720c portables require an ABIOS patch to 
install and run Windows NT. Copy the following files from the ThinkPad
Reference Diskette onto C:\
     ABIOS.SYS
     SF*.BIO

3.4 Olivetti LSX5030

For the Olivetti LSX5030, disable all ROM shadowing.

3.5 Toshiba T4400SX Monochrome

The Toshiba T4400SX display is not supported when an 
external monitor is connected.

3.6 Gateway Nomad and TI Travelmate Notebooks

To successfully install Windows NT on these machines, you 
must choose "Custom Setup". If you encounter problems 
running setup while scanning for SCSI Adapters, you can 
delete the SCSI drivers from the setup diskette to solve 
the problem.

To properly use the floppy drive with Windows NT, configure 
the system using its setup utility. Set the Advanced Operating 
System option to Auto. When power management drivers for 
these machines are available from Texas Instruments, using 
the Auto option will not be necessary.

The built in InPort/QuickPort mouse adapter requires a mouse 
driver from Texas Instruments to work properly under Windows NT.
You can use a serial mouse until this driver is available from 
Texas Instruments.

In order to use the internal modem for these computers, you will 
need a power management driver and software from Texas Instruments.

The best configuration for the NE2000 Network Adapter under 
Windows NT is at IRQ5 and  I/O Port 340H.

3.7 Gateway 2000 and Micronics Gemini 486 VESA Local Bus
Motherboards

Windows NT may stop running on systems that use Ultrastor's U34F Local
Bus controller with the Micronics Gemini 486 VESA Local Bus motherboard.
Some older Gateway systems include this combination of hardware.

The problem is a timing issue that only appears with Windows NT, the
Ultrastor U34F, and the Micronics Gemini 486 VESA Local Bus
motherboard. Disabling the motherboard's external cache should allow
Windows NT to run. The problem does not occur with ISA bus controllers
from Ultrastor. This problem does not occur on Gateway 2000 or Micronics
VESA Local Bus motherboards with a blue OverDrive socket.

If you encounter this problem, you can resolve it by an upgrade offered by
Micronics for the Gemini 486 VESA Local Bus motherboard. The
motherboard will need to be returned to Micronics for an upgrade. The
Micronics reference number for this is VLBA03. Micronics can be reached at
510-651-2300 for additional information.  If you have a Gateway computer,
contact Gateway 2000 at 800-846-2301 for upgrade information.

3.8 Zeos Freestyle/SL Notebook Computer

When performing a Windows NT installation on this computer, you 
must power off the computer after the text-based portion of Setup is 
complete and you have been prompted to press CTRL+ALT+DEL to 
restart the computer. Otherwise a keyboard controller failure may occur.

4.0  General Disk Drive Information

4.1 Volume Sets Created Via the BIOS

On controllers other than the UltraStor 124f, Windows NT does not 
support disk controllers that create volume sets via the BIOS 
(i.e. two different drives merged into a single drive letter).

4.2 Caching Disk Controllers and Drives

Windows NT supports caching disk controllers and drives only if one of 
the following is true:

-  The controller has a driver that specifically supports caching 
(several of these exist: DPT and  IBM SCSI Caching Adapter).

- Write-through is active (i.e. write caching is disabled) either by 
setting it manually or by default when the computer starts.

- The entire cache option is off, either by setting it manually or by 
default when the computer starts.

Using a caching controller or drive in other situations risks loss of 
data if the computer is rebooted or a power failure occurs before the 
cache has flushed itself. You can minimize risk by waiting at least 1 
minute (less if you know the maximum time the cache waits before 
flushing itself) after all system activity stops before rebooting. 
The disk activity light is a good indicator of how write caching is 
being done on your system. This applies to the initial Windows NT 
installation as well as shutdown. Note that unexpected power failure 
at any time can potentially corrupt data on the disk, possibly to the 
extent that the disk becomes unreadable. Making the delay time that 
write data is cached before being flushed to disk as small as 
possible reduces this risk.

4.3  IDE/ESDI Drive Support

The Windows NT IDE/ESDI drive support is limited to two 
disk drives per controller. A second IDE/ESDI controller from 
Compaq (on Compaq machines only) or built in like the 
Gateway 2000 VESA local bus machines is supported by the 
standard Windows NT product.  If you have a need to
configure from 2 to 6 IDE or ESDI controllers in one 
system, contact MS Product Support Services for details on 
how to do so.

4.4  Installing onto Systems with an ESDI Drive Containing More 
Than 1024 Cylinders

In some cases, Windows NT installation proceeds normally until the 
first boot from the hard drive where Windows NT is installed. The 
Windows NT Boot loader will load various files and then produce a 
Fatal System Error: 0x0000006b with the message that Phase 1 Process
Initialization failed. Following this message will be some type of
hex dump and the system will be locked up. If you experience this 
difficulty the following information can help.

Testing has been done on the following ESDI controllers using a hard
drive with a capacity exceeding 516 MB (MB=1,048,576 bytes) formatted.
The MS-DOS limit of 1024 cylinders creates a situation where special
BIOS mapping on the controller is used to change the geometry of the
drive. ESDI drives are capable of being prepared with various values
of "sectors per track" (spt) such as 53 or 63 spt geometry during a
low-level format. Here is a brief example of a drive capacity using a
different spt format.

    1024 cylinders  X  15 heads  X  53 spt  X  512 bytes per sector =
        398MB formatted capacity
or

    1024 cylinders  X  15 heads  X  63 spt  X  512 bytes per sector =
        472MB formatted capacity

Thus using 63 spt will yield 74MB more space. Windows NT is perfectly
compatible with either geometry, and depending on the drive/controller
can access the remaining cylinders beyond 1024. This space can be
partitioned and formatted but not accessed by MS-DOS as the boot OS.
However, some controllers can successfully remap the remaining
cylinders beyond 1024 so that either MS-DOS or Windows NT can use the
entire capacity. An example would be:

    1632 cylinders  X  15 heads  X  53 spt  X  512 bytes per sector =
        634MB formatted capacity

Testing has been done on the following ESDI controllers with their
Windows NT compatibility results:

DTC (Data Technology Corp)

    Model 6282-24: 

    Maximum Windows NT compatible geometry is to use 63 spt and limit
    of 1024 cylinders under MS-DOS. Windows NT will be able to access
    the cylinders beyond 1024. Do not low-level the drive using Head
    Mapping Mode.  

    Model 6290-24: 

    Maximum Windows NT compatible geometry is to use 63 spt and limit
    of 1024 cylinders under MS-DOS. Since this card does not have an
    onboard BIOS, Windows NT cannot access the remaining cylinders
    beyond 1024.  

    Model 6290 SEZ (Dual SCSI/ESDI Controller): 

    Maximum Windows NT compatible geometry is using BIOS translation
    in the EISA configuration using 63 spt and limit of 1024
    cylinders under MS-DOS. Windows NT can access the remaining
    cylinders beyond 1024.  

    Model 6295-24: 

    Maximum Windows NT compatible geometry is to use 63 spt and limit
    of 1024 cylinders under MS-DOS. This model does have an onboard BIOS
    so Windows NT can access the remaining cylinders beyond 1024. Do
    not low-level the drive using Head Mapping Mode.

Adaptec

    Model 2322D:  

    Several methods that can achieve maximum drive capacity are as
    follows:

    1.  Disable drive translation and the on-board controller bios.
        Then use a user defined drive type with the actual drive
        parameters.  For example:

            Drive Type in CMOS=48 Cylinders=1632  Heads=15 SPT=53

        This will give 634MB capacity. MS-DOS will still be limited to
        the first 1024 cylinders which makes 398MB available. Windows
        NT will be able to access the cylinders beyond 1024 yielding
        another 236MB.

    2.  This option allows both MS-DOS & Windows NT to access the entire
        drive.  Jumper the controller for Drive Splitting. Disable
        drive translation and the on-board controller BIOS. Set up
        the first physical drive in the CMOS as:
            
            Cylinders=1024  Heads=15  SPT=53

        which will give a drive capacity of 398MB. Set up the second
        drive (it appears as a physical drive) in the CMOS as:
        
            Cylinders=606  Heads=15  SPT=53

        This will yield another 236MB. Windows NT will actually see
        the drive as two physical drives.


UltraStor

    All models with PROM versions less than #####-009

    Maximum Windows NT compatible geometry is to use 63 spt and limit
    of 1024 cylinders under MS-DOS. Windows NT will be able to access
    the cylinders beyond 1024.  

    All models with PROM versions equal to or greater than #####-009

    Maximum Windows NT compatible geometry is to use "Track mapping"
    during Low-Level formatting. Both MS-DOS and Windows NT will have
    access to entire drive capacity.  


5.0  SCSI Devices

Windows NT supports over 60 SCSI host adapters, over 30 SCSI CD-ROM 
drives, over 40 SCSI tape drives, over 10 SCSI removable media systems, 
and SCSI scanners.  Here are some detailed notes on Windows NT's SCSI 
support.

This section provides information on configuring SCSI devices when 
running Windows NT.

5.1 SCSI CD-ROM Devices

The SCSI and CD-ROM support built into Windows NT 3.1 requires that
CD-ROMs provide SCSI parity to function properly.  For many drives 
this is a configurable option or is active by default.  Check the
documentation for your CD-ROM to find specifics on how this is 
configured for your drive. Examples of drives which do not provide 
or support SCSI parity are the NEC CDR-36 and CDR-37 drives.

5.2 Installing from a SCSI CD-ROM Device

When you are installing Windows NT from a SCSI CD-ROM device, make 
sure that the device does not have an ID of 0 or 1. Some SCSI BIOS 
programs reserve 0 and 1 for hard disks. If you set your CD-ROM with 
an ID of 0 or 1, you will likely see an extra partition in Setup that 
does not exist.

If you have 2 CD-ROM devices connected to the same SCSI Host Adapter,
then Windows NT Setup does not necessarily install using the CD-ROM that
contains the higher SCSI ID. If using one CD-ROM results in Setup
displaying a message "Please insert the CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive,"
then remove the CD and try the other CD-ROM.  Setup chooses one CD-
ROM drive and refers to it as 'the' CD-ROM drive.

5.3 Installing Windows NT with a Proprietary Adapter Driver

Some SCSI and proprietary CD-ROM adapter drivers are provided in the 
Driver Library on the Windows NT CD.  These drivers are contained in 
a directory tree below the \DRVLIB directory. Some of the drivers will 
have a readme.txt containing additional configuration information.  
Please read this information before installing.

To install using one of these drivers:

1. Using your current operating system, access the Windows NT CD-ROM, 
and change to the directory containing the driver that you want to use.

2. Copy all files in that directory to a blank, formatted floppy 
placed in drive A: (Windows NT Setup requires the driver to be on 
a disk in drive A).  Label the disk "Driver Disk"

3. Shut down your current operating system (if necessary), and reboot 
with the Windows NT CD-ROM Boot disk in drive A.

4. When Setup asks for Custom or Express setup, choose Custom.

5. When choosing an adapter press 'S' for additional SCSI adapters.

6. Choose "Other (requires disk provided by hardware manufacturer)."

7. Setup prompts for the driver disk.  Insert the "Driver Disk" in 
drive A.


5.4 Installing with Unsupported CD-ROM Drives

Please refer to the chapter "Installing Windows NT" in the Windows NT 
System Guide or Windows NT Advanced Server System Guide for 
information on installing Windows NT from MS-DOS when your system 
has an unsupported CD-ROM drive.

5.5 Adding a CD-ROM After Installing Windows NT

If you add a CD-ROM drive after you have installed Windows NT, use the
Devices option in Control Panel to configure device startup. For all 
CD-ROM drives, set the Startup value of Scsicdrm to System. If your 
drive does not support SCSI-2 Audio, also set the Startup value of 
Cdaudio to System. Cdaudio should also be set to System for some SCSI-1 
CD-ROM drives, including the Denon DRD-253; Pioneer-DRM-600; NEC 
Intersect 73, 73m, 74, 84; and Hitachi 1750s, 1650s, 3650.

For more information on starting devices, choose the Help button in the
Devices dialog box.

5.6 NEC Intersect CD-ROM

NEC Intersect CD-ROM readers have a switch that enables disconnects
during accesses to the reader. This switch is off by default, disabling
disconnects. Because of this, while your CD-ROM is being read, no other
devices on that SCSI bus can be accessed. Since reads from a reader 
can take a significant amount of time, having this switch off can 
noticeably degrade system performance. This slow-down may occur even 
if you are not using the CD-ROM reader. To avoid this problem, set 
switch number 5 ON. The switch is located with switches labeled SW1.

5.7 SCSI Termination

The SCSI bus must be properly terminated on both ends. If you are 
using both an external and an internal SCSI device, it is best to 
terminate the devices and remove the terminators on the SCSI adapter.

For the SCSI adapter to operate effectively, termination power must be
provided on the SCSI bus either by the adapter or by a SCSI device 
connected to the bus. Some adapters provide termination power with 
no configuration options. Others do not provide termination power 
(for example, Future Domain 1660 and Trantor 128 and 130B). Still 
others provide termination power only if a jumper is set on the 
adapter (for example, Future Domain 850M).

Please consult the documentation for your SCSI adapter and SCSI 
device to make sure that termination power is present on the SCSI bus.

5.8 Adaptec

An Adaptec adapter might use conflicting memory addresses with other 
cards such as network adapters. This requires reconfiguring the 
hardware by changing jumpers.

DMA speed cannot be set on an Adaptec 154x SCSI controller. Currently 
the AHA154X.SYS driver supports a DMA transfer rate of 5.0 MB. 

The Adaptec AHA154xC card is extremely sensitive to termination and 
cabling. Systems with this card should use SCSI-II cables and/or 
SCSI-II active terminators.  SCSI-II cables are available from 
Amphenol Quintec and Icontec.  If these recommendations are not 
followed, unreliable operation, including data corruption, is possible.

The Adaptec AHA-1542C and Denon DRD-253 are incompatible under Windows 
NT.  The AHA-1542C requires active termination and the Denon DRD-253 
CD-ROM has built in passive termination.

The Adaptec 1640 Micro Channel adapter does not support the Maynard 
2000 or 1300 DAT drives in this release.  The 1640 adapter is not 
supported on IBM PS/2 Model 70 computers.

There is a known problem using Micronics VL bus motherboards with 
Adaptec 1542x adapters. 

The 1988 version 3.08 Adaptec 154x BIOS has a problem with the 
Scatter/Gather feature. This problem is detected by the Adaptec 
driver and the feature is disabled. If you have this BIOS version 
a message is displayed informing you that the Scatter/Gather feature 
has been disabled. If you get this message, you can contact the Adaptec
Technical Support at (408) 945-2550 for information on the most recent
version, 3.20, of the BIOS. BIOS versions after 3.08 do not have this 
problem. The latest 154x BIOS also supports drives that are larger 
than 1 GB under both BIOS/MS-DOS and Windows NT. Windows NT will be 
able to access drives larger than 1 GB even without this upgrade 
provided and extended partition is used.

The Adaptec AHA164x driver logs unnecessary errors.  These occur while
NTBACKUP is in use with a tape connected to the AHA164x.  The entries 
look like:

7/10/93 2:41:40 AM      AHA154x Error   None    11      N/A
[MachineName]  The driver detected a controller error on \Device\ScsiPort1.

These entries may be ignored.  Also when too many of these entries are
generated a pop-up is created indicating the error log is full.  This 
can be avoided by setting the system event log settings to overwrite 
the events as needed.

5.9 Buslogic

When using a Buslogic 747 SCSI Adapter with an AST Manhattan SMP 
computer, you must disable the adapter's BIOS. For more information 
on disabling the BIOS, refer to the adapter's documentation.

5.10 Compaq Smart SCSI Array

The Compaq Smart SCSI Array must be configured to use any possible
interrupt other than IRQ 2 to function properly under Windows NT.

5.11 Dell Drive Array

The Adaptec emulation mode on the Dell Drive Array (DDA) must
be disabled for compatibility with the hardware's Windows NT driver.

5.12 Future Domain

The Windows NT driver that supports the Future Domain 845, 850, and 
885 adapters assumes operation on IRQ 5. If the adapter is set for 
another interrupt, the Future Domain driver will continue to work, 
but in a polling fashion that may slow down operation of the system. 
Further, the Future Domain driver will register to the system claiming 
the use of IRQ 5 and this may disrupt operation of another device 
that is actually configured for IRQ 5. If you are using one of the 
above mentioned Future Domain adapters, please complete the Windows 
NT installation normally, then change the IRQ information for the 
driver in the registry.   If the IRQ is incorrect, the driver will 
log an event viewable in the Event Viewer Administrative Tool.

If you have a 16-bit Future Domain card or an 8-bit M series card 
configured with an external SCSI device, make sure that SCSI 
termination is correct. You must set a jumper on the card for this 
setting. Check the cards documentation for details.

A Future Domain SCSI adapter might use conflicting memory addresses. 
This requires reconfiguring the hardware by changing jumpers.

5.13 IBM PS/2 SCSI Adapter

To configure an IBM SCSI adapter with a BIOS dated before 1991 for use
with Windows NT, use a PS/2 Reference Diskette version 1.21 or later.

5.14 Maynard SCSI Adapter

You cannot use Express Setup to install Windows NT onto a hard disk 
attached to a WD33C9C SCSI host adapter (Maynard SCSI adapter) because 
Setup cannot identify this adapter. However, you can use Custom Setup 
to install this adapter card. Or, after Setup, you can use the Setup 
icon to install the adapter card.

5.15 Mylex DCE376 and Tangent 48933 USA

The Tangent and Zeos 433 EISA system comes standard with a Mylex 376
controller which operates in WD1003 emulation mode by default. This 
will be no longer be necessary when a SCSI driver for this card becomes
available for Windows NT.

5.16 UltraStor SCSI Controllers

If you experience a problem in tape functionally with a supported 4mm 
DAT Tape Device and an UltraStor 14F or 24F controller, contact 
UltraStor for an upgrade to resolve this.

If you have an UltraStor 34F controller installed into a Micronics VLB
motherboard, it is recommended that you turn the motherboard external 
cache off.

The UltraStor 124 adapter is compatible with removable media drives, 
but does not allow the user to remove and replace media. For this reason,
Windows NT does not support removable media drives when used with this
controller.

The combination of the UltraStor 14F and DEC Talk Speech Synthesizer 
Card can cause Windows NT Setup to fail due to an I/O port conflict. 
To avoid this problem, either set the DEC I/O to 350, or delete the 
file ULTRA14F.SYS from the boot floppy while leaving the DEC card at 
default settings. 

5.17 Trantor

These adapters are SCSI-termination sensitive. If Windows 
NT hangs upon booting, or if Windows NT Setup cannot find devices 
attached to a Trantor adapter, verify that the SCSI termination 
occurred and that one of the SCSI devices attached to the Trantor 
adapter is providing termination power.

The Trantor T228 MCA SCSI adapter is not supported on the IBM PS/2 
Model 95.

5.18 Texel DM-5024 CD-ROM

A firmware level of 1.10C is required to make the DM-5024 CD-ROM
compatible with Windows NT.  Contact Texel at 1-800-886-3935 for
information on this upgrade.

6.0  Error Messages

6.1  Couldn't Find NTLDR

This message is displayed if the file NTLDR is missing from the root 
of the C: drive. You can copy the file to C:\ from either the CD ROM 
or floppy disks.

To copy NTLDR from the CD ROM, make the CD ROM your current drive and 
enter the command:
	copy \i386\ntldr C:\

To copy NTLDR from floppy disk, insert Disk 2 in your disk drive and 
make that drive the current drive. Then enter the command:
	expand ntldr.$ c:\ntldr

6.2  Error 0000001E

Generally, this error implies a problem in the file system. Run CHKDSK 
or another similar utility on the drive. Make sure your hardware is on 
the hardware compatibility list. 

6.3  Error 0x00000069 or 0x00000067

This initialization error indicates that Windows NT is unable to 
communicate with the hard drive controller. Try the following:
	- Slow down the DMA transfer rate on the controller.
	- Make sure both ends of the SCSI bus are terminated.
	- Make sure there are no IRQ or memory address conflicts.
	- Make sure you are not using a faulty or unsupported driver.
	- Make sure NTDETECT.COM is in the root of the boot drive partition.
	- Make sure there are no missing Windows NT system files. 

6.4  NMI Hardware Error

This error is caused by a hardware problem. In some cases, the 
computer's memory can be at fault, leading to an error that does 
not appear when running MS-DOS or Windows 3.x, but does appear when 
running Windows NT. Memory errors can occur when the access rate does 
not match the requirements of the system board or when the access 
rate varies between SIMM modules or chips on a module. Cache memory 
access rates that are too slow can also cause this problem. In general,
the first steps toward troubleshooting are to make sure that contacts 
for all boards and memory modules are clean, that boards and memory 
modules are properly seated, and that the computer is free of dust.

6.5 System Error F002

If you receive a System Error F002, this probably means that your 
hardware is faulty; for example, you may be experiencing a memory 
failure. If this occurs, run the manufacturer's diagnostics procedure 
and check to see if your memory is the proper speed for your CPU.

7.0  Video Display Drivers and Adapters (x86 Computers)

Windows NT has excellent video support, supporting over 45 video 
display adapters, including excellent high-end support.  Here are 
some detailed notes on Windows NT's video support.

The information in this section is applicable for x86 computers only. 
To select a video adapter other than VGA, you must run Custom Setup 
or run Windows NT Setup from the Main program group after you have 
completed installation.

This release supports the VGA standard video cards plus some newer 
video cards. If the video card you use is not listed in this section, 
select VGA as the display device in Windows NT Setup. If you choose a 
display mode in Setup that your hardware does not support, you will 
need to reinstall Windows NT. You should be careful when installing 
some of the higher resolution modes to be sure that your monitor 
supports the resolution and vertical refresh rates.

If the display mode selected by the user is not valid -- because the 
video card was not present or because the card had insufficient video 
memory -- an alternate driver will be selected by Setup automatically 
so that the computer is able to boot.

If you encounter problems read your video manual again for proper settings.
You may have overlooked something in the manual that pertains to Windows
NT if you previously installed the card under Windows 3.1.

In general, Windows NT video drivers do not use interrupts. Many VGA
cards use jumpers to enable IRQ 2 interrupt for EGA compatibility. When
possible, you should disable the IRQ 2 interrupt.

During setup Windows NT may allow you to set the vertical refresh rate for
your card. Read your monitor manual to see what settings you can use. If you
are unsure, set up at the lower resolution, and then later try higher resolutions.
If after changing these settings and rebooting, you find that your display is not
operating correctly, reboot again and use the "last known good" feature to
restore your previous video settings. Be aware of the fact that some monitors
may be physically damaged by wrong video settings.

Minimum video memory requirements for Windows NT:

640x480x16 colors                512K

800x600x16 colors                512K
800x600x256 colors               1M
1024x768x16 colors               512K
1024x768x256 colors              1M
1280x1024x256 colors             See individual driver requirements

7.1 VGA

If you experience a problem with the standard VGA driver, try the 
alternative VGA driver that programs the VGA directly. The standard 
VGA driver uses the VGA display adapter's BIOS to initialize the card. 
To use the alternate driver, rename the standard driver VGA.SYS to 
VGA.SAV. Then copy VGA_ALT.SYS to VGA.SYS and reboot.

7.2 8514/A and Compatible Cards

When installing Windows NT on a computer that has an 8514/A or
compatible graphic card (for example, IBM's 8514/A or ATI's 8514Ultra),
and the computer has an older version of BIOS, Custom Setup may display
your video card as "Unknown."

You can change the video driver from "Unknown" to the Standard VGA
(640x480, 16 colors) driver during Windows NT Setup.  If you have an ATI
8514 Ultra graphic card, after Windows NT Setup is completed, you can run
Windows NT Setup located in the Main group in Program Manager to select
the appropriate ATI video driver.  Express Setup will default the video 
driver to the Standard VGA (640x480, 16 colors) when an unknown video 
card is detected.

There is no other video driver for 8514/A or compatible graphic cards
included in this release of Windows NT.

7.3 Cirrus-based Cards

For boards based on the Cirrus Logic chip set, select Cirrus with the
appropriate resolution during Setup.

7.4 VESA VGA

The VESA VGA driver uses the newer standard for detecting if a card
can handle the 800x600 Super VGA mode.  VESA VGA is not supported, if
you have a card that uses the old standard, or a card that required an MS-
DOS-based TSR to implement Super VGA functionality. Standard VGA
mode is supported instead.

7.5 Diamond SpeedSTAR (and any ET4000 SVGA)

For the Diamond SpeedSTAR cards, select ET4000 with the appropriate 
display mode during Setup. 

Some ET4000 adapters do not support the setting of refresh rates 
through software.  

If you have a card with only 512K bytes of video memory, the 
800x600x256 and 1024x768x256 color modes will not work correctly.

7.6 ProDesigner II Display

For the Orchid Technologies ProDesigner II and ProDesigner IIs cards, 
select ET4000 with the appropriate display mode during Setup. 

7.7 S3 VGA

To run the S3 video driver, your graphics adapter must have at least 1 MB of
video memory.

The vertical refresh rate for most S3 based video is set by dip switches on the
card, or by running an MS-DOS program that programs the adapter's ROM.
For these systems, select the default setting in Windows NT Setup. The MS-
DOS setup program for these cards, must be run under MS-DOS. If you have
a DELL machine or Number Nine card, you may use the other settings when
listed.

If you experience difficulties using the S3-based video card on your Hewlett-
Packard Vectra computer, call Hewlett-Packard technical support to upgrade
your BIOS EEPROMS.

7.8 Trident

For Trident cards, select Trident with the appropriate display mode during
Setup. Trident 8900c based boards do not show 256 color MS-DOS-based
applications in frozen windows well.

7.9 Video Seven, Headland Technologies VRAM II, and VRAM II Ergo

For these devices, select Video Seven VRAM with the appropriate resolution
during Setup.

When using the VRAM II with BIOS version 8.05, you may see random
characters or vertical lines when rebooting. Contact Headland Technologies
for a ROM upgrade.

The VRAM II Ergo display card also causes problems if its DIP switches are
not set correctly. All the switches should be off (set to the right) except for
switch #3. If this fails to correct your problem, please contact Headland
Technologies technical support.

VRAM I BIOS rev. 1.18 does not support any 256-color modes under
Windows NT.

The IRQ jumper settings should always be set OFF. Note that on 
BIOS rev. 8.57 and 8.59, the settings are the reverse of that shown
 in the documentation. 

7.10 Western Digital/Paradise

For Western Digital cards, select WD with the appropriate display mode 
during Setup. We have performed testing on WD90C30 and WD90C31 chip sets.

7.11 XGA

For these devices, select XGA or XGA2 with the appropriate resolution 
during Setup. The XGA cards require 1 MB of video memory, and only 
support 256 color modes. Make sure that your monitor supports the 
modes you select.

Only install the XGA driver on portables with plasma displays if an 
external monitor is attached.

7.12 ATI

The ATI drivers support the following boards:
GRAPHICS ULTRA
GRAPHICS VANTAGE
8514/ULTRA
GRAPHICS ULTRA PRO
GRAPHICS ULTRA+

The GRAPHICS ULTRA, GRAPHICS VANTAGE, and 8514/ULTRA
with 1 MB of graphics memory support resolutions of 640x480, 800x600,
1024x768 at 256 colors.

The GRAPHICS ULTRA PRO and GRAPHICS ULTRA+ with 2 MB of
graphics memory and the aperture enabled support the following resolutions:

640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, 1280x1024 at 8 bpp with 256 colors
640x480, 800x600, 1024x768 at 16 bpp with 65,536 colors
640x480, 800x600 at 24 bpp with 16,777,216 colors
640x480	 at 32 bpp with 16,777,216 colors

The GRAPHICS ULTRA PRO and GRAPHICS ULTRA+ with 1 MB of
graphics memory and the aperture enabled support the following resolutions:

640x480, 800x600, 1024x768 at 8 bpp with 256 colors
640x480	 at 16 bpp with 65,536 colors

The GRAPHICS ULTRA PRO and GRAPHICS ULTRA+ in an ISA bus
computer and the aperture disabled support the following resolutions:

640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, 1280x1024 at 8 bpp 	with256 colors
640x480, 800x600, 1024x768 at 16 bpp 	with 65,536 colors

The supported resolutions and pixel depths are conditional on there being
enough memory on the card. All cards require a minimum of 1 MB of
graphics memory. The pixel depth is conditional on the DAC type on the
display adapter. If you choose a resolution that is not supported or your card
has not been installed for, the driver substitutes a supported resolution.

The following configurations are not supported:

The GRAPHICS ULTRA, GRAPHICS VANTAGE, and 8514/ULTRA at
1280x1024 and 16 colors.

The GRAPHICS ULTRA PRO, and GRAPHICS ULTRA+ if you have an
ISA bus and NO aperture (ie more than 12 megs RAM) at the following
resolutions:
640x480, 800x600 at 24 bpp with 16,777,216 colors
640x480	32 at bpp with 16,777,216 colors]

8.0  Removable Media

Removable media drives (such as Bernoulli and Syquest) are supported 
for use with the FAT and NTFS file systems only.

Optical drives that support media with sector sizes larger than 512 
bytes must have the 512-byte sector size media mounted while 
installing Windows NT, even if Windows NT is not being installed onto 
the optical drive.

If you install Windows NT or any portion of Windows NT onto removable 
media, be sure to shut down Windows NT before removing the media. 
(That is, choose Shutdown from the File menu of Program Manager.) 
Do not remove the media until after Windows NT has completed its 
shutdown process.  Media must be installed to run Windows NT Setup.

9.0  Supported Keyboard Layouts

During setup, the following keyboard layouts cannot be used:
	Czech
	Greek
	Hungarian
	Polish Programmer
	Russian

These keyboards are for use only with Unicode applications and 
require installing the Unicode font, Lucida Sans Unicode.

10.0  Installing Windows NT over NextStep

NextStep makes nonconventional changes to partition tables that can 
distort measurement of the amount of space remaining on a drive. If 
more space is reported than is actually available, installation can 
fail due to lack of space on the drive. 

11.0  Converting File Systems During Installation

If your disk is too fragmented, there may not be enough room for 
Setup to create the system files. If this occurs, Setup will not be 
able to convert a volume at the conclusion of installation. Before 
trying to convert the volume again, either delete some files, or 
backup and reformat the drive. 

12.0 Reporting Problems

If you encounter a system problem, please report it to Microsoft 
using BUGREP.TXT.  This file is located in the \SUPPORT\SUPTOOLS 
directory on the CD-ROM as well as floppy Disk #4 of the floppy 
install disk set. Additionally, SAMPBUG.TXT is an example of a 
completed bug report.
