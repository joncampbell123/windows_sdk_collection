EXETYPE 1.0 is a tool to determine the nature of an executable file.
Syntax: EXETYPE <filename> 

NOTE:  EXETYPE does not yet support file wildcards.
	
	It is necessary to have the EXETYPE.INI file somewhere in your PATH 
	(if unsure, type PATH).  
	The format of EXETYPE.INI is as follows:
	
	[entry1]         
	TYPE    <string>
	ADDRESS <hex value> or **
	OFFSET  <hex value>
	MASK    <hex value>
	VALUE   <hex value> or !<hex value>
	ADDRESS <hex value> or **
	OFFSET  <hex value>
	MASK    <hex value>
	VALUE   <hex value> or !<hex value>
	.
	.
	.
    
	[entry2]         
	TYPE    <string>
	HEADER  <hex value> or **
	OFFSET  <hex value>
	MASK    <hex value>
	VALUE   <hex value> or !<hex value>
	.
	.
	.
	

    Each Entry has one TYPE field and from 1 to 5 groups of 
    ADDRESS, OFFSET, MASK and VALUE fields.      
    
    NOTE: All hex values must have an even number of characters (we're working 
	  with byte values here.  If an odd number of nybbles is needed, please 
	  pad with zeros. 
    
    A description of each entry follows:
     [entry] -  This denotes the start of a new entry.  80 characters maximum.
     TYPE        -  A description of the file type, 80 characters maximum.
     ADDRESS     -  Microsoft EXE files have the address of the header at a certain 
			location.  This value is kept at offset 3c from the beginning
			of the file.  If your entry does not use this, put in ** and it 
			will be ignored.
     OFFSET      -      This hex value denotes the offset from the beginning of the 
			header.  
     MASK        -      This bitmask lets you screen which bits of the bytes you want
			to look at.
     VALUE       -  This is the actual value you are comparing to the value of the
			bits at OFFSET strained through MASK.  If it is preceded by a "!", the 
			criterion is that the two values do NOT match.
