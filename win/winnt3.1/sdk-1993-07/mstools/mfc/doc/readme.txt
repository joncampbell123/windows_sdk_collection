             MICROSOFT FOUNDATION CLASSES : TECHNICAL NOTES
=======================================================================


What is a Technical Note?
-------------------------
A technical note is a document written for programmers by programmers.
Each note describes a problem or feature using code fragments and
examples that would be too detailed for the standard print documentation.
The topics are chosen based on feedback from users and programmers
on the MFC library project. 

If you have any suggestions for technical notes, please submit your
ideas through Microsoft Product Support or the Microsoft Software
Developer Support Forum on Compuserve.
