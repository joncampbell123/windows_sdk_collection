#16 : MFC and Multiple Inheritance

This note describes how to use Multiple Inheritance (MI) with
the Microsoft Foundation Classes.

=============================================================================
Why Multiple Inheritance ?
==========================

There is an ongoing debate in the C++ and object oriented communities
over the value of multiple inheritance (MI).   The C7 compiler
and development environment fully supports MI.

The MFC class library has been designed so that you do not need to
understand MI to use it.  MI is not used in any of the MFC classes.
We have found that MI is not required to write a class library,
nor is it required for writing serious applications.
The use of MI or not can be a personal decision, so we leave that
decision to you.

So you want to use MI?
======================
If you already understand how to use MI, understand
the performance trade-offs, and want to use MFC,
this technote will tell you what you must do.
Some of the restrictions are general C++ restrictions,
others are imposed by the MFC architecture.

There is one MFC sample that uses MI.  The MINSVRMI example
(in \c700\mfc\samples\minsvrMI) is a minimal OLE server that
is implemented with one class.  The non-MI version is called
MINSVR (in \c700\mfc\samples\minsvr) and is implemented
with 5 classes.

This is perhaps an excessive example of using MI (5 base classes),
but it illustrates the points made here.

=============================================================================
CObject - the root of all classes
=================================

As you know, all significant classes derive directly or indirectly
from CObject.  CObject does not have any member data, but does
have some default functionality.

When using MI, it will be common to inherit from two or more
CObject derived classes, for example a CFrameWnd and a CObList:

    class CListWnd : public CFrameWnd, public CObList
    {
     ...
    };
    CListWnd myListWnd;

In this case CObject is included twice, which leads to two problems:
    1) any reference to CObject member functions must be disambiguated.

        myListWnd.Dump(afxDump);
            // compile time error, CFrameWnd::Dump or CObList::Dump ?

    2) static member functions, including 'operator new' and 'operator delete'
        must also be disambiguated.

Recommended steps:
------------------
When creating a new class with two or more CObject derived base classes,
re-implement those CObject member that you expect people to use.

Operators 'new' and 'delete' are mandatory, Dump is recommended.

    class CListWnd : public CFrameWnd, public CObList
    {
    public:
        void* operator new(size_t nSize)
            { return CFrameWnd::operator new(nSize); }
        void operator delete(void* p)
            { CFrameWnd::operator delete(p); }

        void Dump(CDumpContent& dc)
            { CFrameWnd::Dump(dc);
              CObList::Dump(dc); }
         ...
    };

Virtual inheritance of CObject ?
---------------------------------
You may ask, "why not inherit CObject virtually, won't all of
the ambiguity problems go away ?".

Well first of all, even in the efficient Microsoft Object Model,
virtual inheritance is not as efficient as non-virtual inheritance
(just as Multiple inheritance is not as efficient as single
inheritance in certain cases.) Since there is no member data in 
CObject, virtual inheritance is not needed to prevent multiple 
copies of a base class's member data.

The real answer is no, virtual inheritance will not solve
all the ambiguity problems illustrated above.
For example: the Dump virtual member function is still
ambiguous (since CFrameWnd and CObList implement it
differently).

Therefore we recommend following the steps above to provide 
disambiguation where you think it is important.

=============================================================================
CObject - IsKindOf and runtime typing
=====================================

The runtime typing mechanism supported by MFC in CObject uses
the macros DECLARE_DYNAMIC, IMPLEMENT_DYNAMIC, DECLARE_SERIAL
and IMPLEMENT_SERIAL.
The resulting programmer feature is the ability to do a runtime
type check to allow for safe cast-downs.

These macros only support a single base class, and will work
in a limited way for multiply inherited classes.
The base class you specify in IMPLEMENT_DYNAMIC or IMPLEMENT_SERIAL
should be the first (or "left-most") base class.  For our example:

    class CListWnd : public CFrameWnd, public CObList
    {
        DECLARE_DYNAMIC(CListWnd)
        ...
    };

    IMPLEMENT_DYNAMIC(CListWnd, CFrameWnd)

This will allow you to do type checking for the "left-most" base class
only.  The runtime type system will know nothing about additional
bases (CObList in this case).

=============================================================================
CWnd - and message maps
=======================

In order for the MFC message map system to work correctly, there are
two additional requirements:

1) there must be only one CWnd derived base class
2) that CWnd derived base class must be the first (or "left-most")
        base class.

In the example above, we have made sure that 'CFrameWnd' is the
first base class.

Some counter examples:
        class CTwoWindows : public CFrameWnd, public CEdit
        { ... };
                // error : two copies of CWnd

        class CListEdit : public CObList, public CEdit
        { ... };
                // error : CEdit (derived from CWnd) must be first
