                         USING RAMDRIVE WITH WINDOWS
================================================================================

First, follow the installation instructions provided by your extended
memory board manufacturer.  Next, copy the file, RAMDRIVE.SYS, from
the Utilities 2 Disk to your fixed disk.  Then add the following command
line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

device=[drive:][path]RAMDRIVE.SYS [bbbb] [ssss] [dddd] [/E or /U]

Note that either /E or /U may be specified, but not both.  If you do
not specify one of these two, then RAMDrive will use system memory
for RAMDrives. It is almost always a bad idea to use conventional
memory for a RAMdrive as it will significantly reduce the performance
of Windows.  Running RAMdrive in extended (/E) memory, or on an AT&T
6300 Plus (/U) is much preferred.  Following is an explanation of the
parameters:

               *NOTE:  Information in a RAMDrive is lost when you
                       re-boot or restart your computer.

        [bbbb]  The first numeric argument, if present, is the amount
                of memory in kilobytes to be used as your RAMDrive.
                If no numeric arguments are specified, then the default
                value is 64K.  The minimum amount of memory needed is
                16K;  the maximum amount of memory possible is 4096K.

        [ssss]  The second numeric argument, if present, is the sector
                size in bytes. If a second numeric argument is not
                specified, the default is 512 bytes.  The four
                possible values are 128, 256, 512, and 1024 bytes.

                NOTE:  With IBM PC-DOS or Olivetti DOS the maximum value
                       allowed is 512 bytes.  With MS-DOS 1024 bytes is
                       the maximum value.

                       Values are rounded up to the nearest sector size
                       boundary.

        [dddd]  The third numeric argument, if present, is the number of
                root directory entries.  If no third numeric argument is
                specified, then the default is 64.  The minimum number of
                entries needed is 2; the maximum number allowed is 1024.

                *NOTE: If there is too little memory to create the number
                       of root directory entries specified, then RAMDrive
                       attempts to create a RAMDrive with fewer root
                       directory entries.

        /E      Specifies that extended memory is to be used for the
                RAMDrive.  

        /U      Specifies that some or all of the 384K of upper extended
                memory on the AT&T 6300 PLUS motherboard is to be used as
                an extra RAMDrive.  You may only specify this parameter
                with an AT&T 6300 PLUS.

                *NOTE: There is 1K of RAMDrive overhead.  Only 383K
                       is available for RAMDrives.  This overhead is
                       constant; it does not depend on the number of
                       RAMDrives installed.

ERROR MESSAGES
================================================================================

    Message:  RAMDrive: Computer must be PC-AT, or PC-AT compatible

Explanation:  There is no extended memory available on your PC-AT or
              compatible for RAMDrives.

     Result:  RAMDRIVE.SYS was not installed.

   Solution:  Remove the /E parameter.  Try installing RAMDrive in
              system memory.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Message:  RAMDrive: No extended memory available

Explanation:  Your computer has no memory available for RAMDrives.

     Result:  RAMDRIVE.SYS was not installed.

   Solution:  Free some extended memory or obtain more memory.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Message:  RAMDrive: Insufficient memory

Explanation:  Your computer has some memory available, but not enough
              to set up a RAMDrive.

     Result:  RAMDRIVE.SYS was not installed.

   Solution:  Free some extended memory or obtain more memory.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Message:  RAMDrive: Invalid parameter

Explanation:  The parameters you specified in your CONFIG.SYS entry for
              RAMDRIVE.SYS are not correct.

     Result:  RAMDRIVE.SYS was not installed.

   Solution:  Check to see if you specified too many parameters, if one
              of your numeric parameters is not valid, if you specified
              conflicting switches ( i.e. only one of /E or /U may be
              specified ), or if you specified too many switches. Change
              the RAMDRIVE.SYS command line in your CONFIG.SYS file to
              conform to the usage described above.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Message:  RAMDrive: Incorrect DOS version

Explanation:  RAMDrive requires DOS 2.X or DOS 3.X.  Windows 2.1
              requires DOS 3.0 or higher.

     Result:  RAMDRIVE.SYS was not installed.

   Solution:  Upgrade to DOS 3.0 or higher.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Message:  RAMDrive: I/O error accessing drive memory

Explanation:  During the set up of the RAMDrive, an error was
              detected in the memory being accessed for RAMDrive.

     Result:  RAMDRIVE.SYS was not installed.

   Solution:  Run the memory test for the memory on which you
              were attempting to install a RAMDrive.

    Message:  Microsoft RAMDrive version Y.YY virtual disk [drive:]

Explanation:  RAMDrive Header message.  Y.YY is the version of
              RAMDrive; [drive:] is the DOS drive letter assigned
              to this RAMDrive.

              NOTE:  On DOS 2.X the "virtual disk d:" part of this
                     message will not be printed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Message:  Disk size: x k
              Sector size: x bytes
              Allocation unit: x sectors
              Directory entries: x

Explanation:  This message tells how many kilobytes of memory were
              assigned to the RAMDrive, how many bytes there are in
              a sector, how many sectors there are in an allocation
              unit, and how many root directory entries there are
              (including the volume label).
