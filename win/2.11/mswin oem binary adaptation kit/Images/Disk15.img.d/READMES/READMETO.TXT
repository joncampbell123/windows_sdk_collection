choose monochrome print type with models that support 
color.


Options Menu: Choosing Fonts

The Options menu lets you choose resident, card, downloadable, 
and cartridge fonts.  The font options available depend on 
the selected model.

When you choose one of the fonts commands, a dialog box appears. 
The Resident Fonts dialog box displays the fonts available on
the selected device. You can leave the highlighted fonts
selected, or you can choose an individual font. Then choose Ok
to implement your choice or Cancel to return to the main dialog
box.

The Card Fonts dialog box displays two card positions, and the
available card fonts. Choose a card slot (either A or B), then
choose a font. Choose Ok to implement your choice, or Cancel to
return to the main dialog box.

Note: For more information about card fonts, see the Toshiba

downloadable fonts. Choose the drive and directory where the
downloadable fonts are installed, and then choose Ok to display
the fonts. Choose a font position and choose the font to
download. If you want to save the current path as the default,
choose the Save option. Then choose Ok.

Downloadable fonts are downloaded to the printer when needed.
After the fonts are downloaded, the Download check box is
"unchecked" so the fonts are not repeatedly downloaded for each
document printed. If the printer is turned off, recheck the
Download check box to reload the selected downloadable fonts.

If text in a document uses a downloadable font that is not
selected in the Downloadable Fonts dialog box, the font is
automatically downloaded when the document is printed, provided
one of the two font positions is vacant. If a downloadable font
position is not available, the text is printed using the
closest available device font. For more information about
downloadable fonts, see the Toshiba User's Manual or contact
Toshiba.

configuration settings: RAM ALOC=DLL, and Buffer Size=2K. For
more information, see the Toshiba User's Manual or contact
Toshiba.

The Cartridge Fonts dialog box displays the fonts available on
cartridge. You must select the name of the cartridge currently
in the printer, then choose Ok to implement your choice, or
Cancel to return to the main dialog box.

You can select either the USA or IBM 2 character set in the
Options menu, if your model supports it. Selecting the IBM 2
character set allows you to access more European characters
than are available in the standard USA character set. The IBM 2
character set has decimal codes above 127. You enter a code in
the Windows application by pressing alt and typing the decimal
code on the numeric keypad. See the Toshiba printer manual for
a listing of the IBM 2 character set.

Note: Make sure the printer setting matches the setting in the
Options menu.
