        If you are modifying the Desktop Applications, you should copy
the files in the \INCLUDE directory to your INCLUDE environment before
attempting to run any of the MAKE files.

                        ** IMPORTANT **

        To rebuild USERx.EXE correctly, you MUST use the RC.EXE and
RCPP.EXE supplied in the USER directory.  The RC Compiler used for the rest of
the kit will not build USERF.EXE and USERS.EXE correctly.  For all of the
other applications, you should use the "default" version of RC.EXE and RCPP.EXE
supplied with the kit. We apologize for this inconvenience.

Sincerely,
