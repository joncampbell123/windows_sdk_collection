#  This MAKE file allows you to remake the CALC module after modifying re-
#  sources (such as ICONS, CURSORS, DIALOGUE BOXES and BITMAPS).  You simply 
#  need to have the WINDOWS 2.0 distribution version of CALC.EXE
#  (which is already supplied) located in this directory.  Then, modify 
#  the resources using the ICONEDIT and DLGEDIT programs.  Then, run this 
#  MAKE file.  Your modified resources will be put into a NEW version 
#  of CALC.EXE.
#
