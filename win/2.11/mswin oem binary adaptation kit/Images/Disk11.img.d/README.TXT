        IMPORTANT!!!! You must use a custom version of MASM.EXE & LINK4.EXE 
when building the WINOLDAP.GRB module.  This is found on the custom C compiler
tools diskette for the OEM kit.  You must use these tools ONLY for
the creation of WINOLDAP.MOD.  They should not be used for any other purpose!
They are called LINK412.EXE and MASM50A.EXE.
