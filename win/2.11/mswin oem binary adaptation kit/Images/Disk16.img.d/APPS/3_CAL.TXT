3 Calendar


________________________________________

Microsoft Windows Calendar is like a desktop calendar and appointment book.

You can maintain more than one Calendar file to keep track of more than one
person's appointments. You can also set alarms to remind you of particular
appointments.

Calendar gives you two views of time. In the Day view, you enter, display,
or edit your appointments for each day. In the Month view, you select the
day for which you want to see appointments.

___________________________________________________________________________
Starting Calendar

Running Calendar

Here's how you start Calendar:


1 Select and run CALENDAR.EXE in the MS-DOS Executive window.

When you first start Calendar, it displays the daily appointment window-the
Day view-for the current date.

Calendar uses the time and date you set when you start your computer. You
can reset the time and date using Control Panel. For details on Control
Panel, see the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.

You enter appointments in the Day view. If you have switched to the Month
view, choose the Day command from the View menu.
Selecting an Appointment Time

The Day view initially shows you a list of times at one-hour intervals,
beginning with 8 A.M. Before typing the description of an appointment, you
need to select the appointment time. You can select a time using either the
keyboard or the mouse.

selected. The next time you select the Alarm menu, a checkmark will appear
by the Set command. When the alarm goes off, Calendar displays a dialog box
reminding you of the appointment. If the Calendar window is inactive, the
title bar at the top of the Calendar window flashes. If Calendar is an icon
when the alarm goes off, the icon flashes.

Changing the Sound Option

You can control whether or not the alarm makes a sound, in addition to
displaying the dialog box or flashing the title bar or icon. Initially, the

You may want to move through your Calendar file to display the appointments
you have entered or to select a day other than the one currently displayed
in the Day view.

Viewing a Different Time

You enter, edit, and view appointments in the Day view. The screen is not
big enough to display all of the day's appointments, but you can scroll the
Day view to see an appointment not currently visible on the screen.


________________________________________
Viewing other times

To view a different time with the keyboard, press the UP or DOWN key to
move from one appointment to another. When you reach the last visible
appointment, use the following keys to scroll the window to the next
appointment:

the scroll box up or down.


Viewing a Different Date


________________________________________
Viewing other dates

You can change the day or month that is displayed by using the commands
from the Show menu. The commands in the Show menu apply to days when you
are using the Day view and to months when you are using the Month view.

To return to the current day or month, do the following:


1 Select the Show menu and choose the Today command.

To display the day or month before the one currently displayed, follow this
step:


1 Select the Show menu and choose the Previous command.

To display the day or month after the one currently displayed,
do the following:


1 Select the Show menu and choose the Next command.

the Day view by clicking one of the scroll arrows in the date line. If you
click anywhere else in the date line, Calendar displays the Month view.

Viewing a Different Date with the Month View

You can use the Month view to select the day for which you want to enter,
edit, or view appointments. Selecting the day using the Month view may be
faster than scrolling through the days one at a time by choosing the
Previous or Next command or by clicking the scroll arrows in the date line
of the Day view.
