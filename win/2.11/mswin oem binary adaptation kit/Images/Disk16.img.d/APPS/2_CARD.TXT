2 Cardfile


________________________________________

Microsoft Windows Cardfile is a filing application you can use to keep
track of names, addresses, phone numbers, directions, or anything else you
want quick access to. Cardfile is like a set of index cards that sorts
itself.

___________________________________________________________________________
Starting Cardfile


________________________________________
Running Cardfile

Here's how you start Cardfile:


1 Select and run CARDFILE.EXE in the MS-DOS Executive window.

When you start Cardfile, it displays an untitled window containing a
single, blank card.

   _________________


___________________________________________________________________________
Creating a Cardfile

To create a cardfile, just fill in the blank card that appears when you
start Cardfile, and then add more cards as you need them.

The Index Line

The index line is the bar at the top of each card. Cardfile uses the text
you put in the index line to sort the cards alphabetically.

________________________________________
Filling in the index
line

To put text in the index line, follow these steps:


1
  Select the Edit menu and choose the Index command or, with the mouse,
  double-click the card's index line. Cardfile displays the Index dialog
  box.

     _________________




     _________________



2 Type the index-line text in the Index Line text box. If you make a
  mistake while typing, use the BACKSPACE key and then retype.


3 Choose the OK button.

After you type the index line, you can add text to the rest of the card.

Typing and Formatting Text


________________________________________
Typing text

You can type in the Cardfile window whenever it is active. Just start
typing at the insertion point in the information area. The insertion point
moves to the right as you type. When your typing reaches the right edge of
the card, Cardfile automatically wraps the text to the next line. When you
have more than one card in your file, Cardfile puts what you type on the
front card.


Moving the Insertion Point

When you start Cardfile or open a file in the Cardfile window, the
insertion point initially appears in the upper-left corner of the front
card. If you work in another window and then come back to Cardfile, the
insertion point reappears where you left it. You can move the insertion
point on the front card to wherever you want to insert or edit text.

________________________________________
Relocating the
insertion point

To move the insertion point with the keyboard, use the keys described in
the following list:

that you want to move and press the BACKSPACE key. Cardfile joins the
current line with the line above it.

Adding a Card


________________________________________
Adding new cards

You can add a new card to a file at any time. Just follow these steps:


1 Select the Card menu and choose the Add command. Cardfile displays the
  Add dialog box.


2 Type the text for the new card's index line in the Add text box.


3 Choose the OK button.

  Cardfile adds the new card to your file in alphabetical order. It then
  scrolls the file to display the new card at the front so that you can add
  text.


___________________________________________________________________________
Moving Through a File

Cardfile commands affect only the front card. To type, look at, or change
information on a card, you need to move through the file and bring the card
to the front.

You can scroll through a file, bring a specific card directly to the front
of a file, or search for a specific occurrence of text in a file. No matter
which method you use, Cardfile always keeps the cards in alphabetical
order.

Scrolling


________________________________________
Scrolling through
your cards

You can scroll through a Cardfile file with either the keyboard
or the mouse. Here's how to scroll through the cards with the
keyboard:

the file with the mouse by clicking the index line.

___________________________________________________________________________
Editing a Card

You edit text on a card by using commands from the Edit menu. You can
change or delete text, or move or copy it to a new location.

You can also transfer text between Cardfile and other applications by using
Clipboard. When you cut or copy text using the Cut or Copy command,
Cardfile puts the text on the Clipboard. The Paste command copies
information from the Clipboard to the front card in your file.

For more information about Clipboard, see the Microsoft Windows User's
Guide.

Changing the Index Line

can find further occurrences by selecting the Search menu and choosing the
Find Next command.

If you choose the Find Next command, Cardfile does not display the Find
dialog box but immediately searches for the last text you typed in the Find
text box.

Adding Information from Another Application

One of Cardfile's most useful features is the ability to transfer both text
and artwork from another application to a card, or from a card to another
application. For example, you might want to create a small map using
Microsoft Windows Paint, then transfer it to a card with a friend's address
on it.


________________________________________
Inserting information
from other
applications

starting with the index line, and puts the first phone number it finds into
the Dial text box. If you want Cardfile to use another number on the card,
select that number before you choose the Autodial command. If you want to
change the number in the Dial text box, retype the number or edit it.

Dial Type  This setting requires that you select the dial type of your
phone. If you normally hear a tone for each number you dial, you have a
tone telephone. If you hear a clicking sound, you probably have a pulse
telephone.

Port  This setting requires that you select the port to which your modem is
connected.

Baud Rate  This setting is determined by your modem. For the correct
setting, consult the owner's manual for your modem.
