Appendix D
Using Special Characters

You can add special characters such as a fraction, an accented letter, a
foreign currency symbol, or a ligature to the documents you create in
Microsoft Windows.

Your computer uses character sets to translate your keystrokes into the
symbols you see on your screen or in the files you create. These sets vary
between computer manufacturers.


________________________________________
The ANSI character set

Windows uses the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) 8-bit
character set, which allows you to represent up to 256 characters (0255).
The ANSI character set is split into two parts: 0127 and 128255.

The first part of most 8-bit character sets (0127) matches the ANSI
character set and corresponds to the letters and symbols you see on a
standard US keyboard. The second 128 characters (128255) represent special
characters such as letters in foreign alphabets, accents, currency symbols,
or fractions. Computer manufacturers often differ in their definitions of
the second part of 8-bit character sets.

This appendix explains how to do the following:


o Type special characters in Windows using the ANSI character set


o Use your computer's character set with Windows applications


o Type special characters in standard applications

Using Special Characters
in a Windows Application

Since Windows uses the extended ANSI character set, you can type any of the
ANSI characters in files you create with Windows. The ANSI character set is
shown on the following chart.

Typing special characters in Windows

To type a special character while you are using Windows, follow these
steps:


1 Locate the character you want on the ANSI chart and its corresponding
  numeric value in the column to left.


2 Press and hold down the ALT key.


3 Using the numeric keypad to the right of your keyboard, type 0 and then
  the 3-digit number from the ANSI chart.


4 Release the ALT key.

Typing a sample special character

For example, to type the English pound symbol () in a Windows file or a
text box, follow these steps:


1 Find the number on the ANSI chart that corresponds to the  symbol (163).


2 Press and hold down the ALT key.


3 Type 0163 on the numeric keypad.


4 Release the ALT key.

The  symbol appears on your screen.

Note If you want to save a file using a special ANSI character in the
filename, make sure the character exists in your computer's character set
as well. If the character does not exist in your com-
puter's character set, Windows substitutes another character.

Using Your Computer's
Character Set in Windows

You can continue to use your computer's character set when you work in
Windows, as long as the special characters you use have an ANSI equivalent.
Windows performs the conversion to ANSI for you. If there is no
corresponding ANSI character, Windows dis-
plays an arbitrary character.

Typing characters with your computer's character set

To type a character from your computer's character set in Windows, follow
these steps:


1 Check your computer's manual for the character's value.


2 Check the preceding ANSI chart to make sure the character is included.


3 Press and hold down the ALT key.


4 Using the numeric keypad on the right of your keyboard, type the three-
  digit number from your computer's character set.


5 Release the ALT key.

Windows converts the special character to its ANSI equivalent and the
character appears on your screen.

As an example, the following chart shows part of the IBM PC extended
character set. These characters have a corresponding ANSI character.

Typing a sample special character

Here's how to type the English pound symbol () in Windows using the IBM PC
extended character set:


1 Press and hold down the ALT key.

2 Type 156.


3 Release the ALT key.

Windows converts the  symbol's value in the computer's character set to its
equivalent value in ANSI, and the ANSI  symbol is displayed on your screen.

Note If, after typing special characters in Windows, you work on your files
with a non-Windows application, you may find that different characters are
substituted for your special characters. This is because the ANSI character
values correspond to different values in your computer's character set.

Using Special Characters
in a Standard Application


________________________________________
Special characters in standard applications

Applications that were not written specifically for Windows (standard
applications) use your computer's character set, but the procedure for
typing the character's value differs slightly from what you may be used to.

In a standard application, type a special character by following these
steps:


1 Check your computer's manual for the character's value.


2 Press and hold down the ALT key.


3 Using the numeric keypad on the right of your keyboard, type 0 and the
  3-digit number from your computer's character set.


4 Release the ALT key.

The special character appears on your screen.

Typing a sample special character

For example, to type the English pound symbol () in a Word document on a
computer that uses the preceding IBM PC extended character chart, you do
the following:


1 Press and hold down the ALT key.


2 Type 0156.


3 Release the ALT key.

The  symbol appears in your Word document.

Using Special Characters
in a Non-Windows Document

If you work in Windows on files created with other applications, you may
find that any special characters appear as arbitrary char-
acters-for example, a black rectangle (). Windows attempts to translate
these characters, but you will probably need to convert each character to
its corresponding ANSI character.

Microsoft Write has an automatic conversion feature that converts
characters in non-Windows files to the ANSI character set. See the
Microsoft Windows Write User's Guide for more information.
