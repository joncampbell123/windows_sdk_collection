Speeding Up Windows
with SMARTDrive

SMARTDrive is a disk-caching program for computers that have a hard disk
and expanded or extended memory. Disk-caching programs are designed to
reduce the amount of time your computer spends reading data from your hard
disk. SMARTDrive, unlike other disk-caching programs, cooperates with
Microsoft Windows to provide the most effective use of the expanded or
extended memory.


________________________________________
Advantages of SMARTDrive

SMARTDrive is ideal for users who work with many applications and files at
once. It is especially useful when running multiple standard applications
that require swapping-copying applications to and from the hard disk to
make room for all applications in memory. Although SMARTDrive can be used
in conjunction with applications that use expanded or extended memory, it
should not be used with other memory-disk or disk-caching
programs.

This appendix describes the following:


o What you need to use SMARTDrive and how it works


o How to set up and use SMARTDrive


o The messages you may see from SMARTDrive

Hardware requirements

To use SMARTDrive with your computer, you need the following:


o An IBM PS/2, IBM PC XT, IBM PC AT, or IBM PCcompatible with a hard disk


o An expanded memory board or an extended memory board



________________________________________
Expanded memory

Expanded memory is memory beyond 640K that uses page-switching technology
(such as INTEL Above Board and AST
RAMPage) and that can be used in most personal computers.
Installation of the expanded-memory-board hardware and a special program
called the expanded memory manager give Windows and its applications access
to the additional memory.


________________________________________
Extended memory

Extended memory is memory beyond one megabyte on PC AT or compatible
systems. This memory is generally not accessible to DOS- and Windows-based
programs but can be used by mem-
ory-disk programs such as IBM VDISK or Microsoft RAMDrive. Extended memory
boards such as the AST RAMPage AT or INTEL Above Board/AT can be set up for
either expanded or extended memory (or both) if the correct software is
installed.


________________________________________
Determining which memory to use

SMARTDrive works best with expanded memory, but will also provide good
results with extended memory. To determine which type of memory to use with
SMARTDrive, follow these rules: if you have only expanded memory, use
expanded; if you have only extended memory, use extended; if you have a
memory card that can be set up to use as expanded or extended memory, set
it up as expanded; and if you have both expanded and extended memory cards,
use extended memory for SMARTDrive and leave expanded memory for Windows.
When using expanded memory, follow the instructions provided by your
memory-board manufacturer for installing the expanded memory manager. It is
recommended that you set up your memory board to provide the maximum amount
of space for expanded memory.

How SMARTDrive Works



________________________________________
Saving time and space with SMARTDrive

SMARTDrive reduces the amount of time it takes for Windows and standard
applications to read information from your hard disk. To do this,
SMARTDrive saves information read from or written to your hard disk in your
computer's expanded or extended mem-
ory. SMARTDrive then supplies this information directly from memory
whenever an application makes a request to read the information from your
hard disk, a relatively time-consuming process. SMARTDrive always copies
new or modified information to the hard disk as well as to expanded or
extended memory, so there is no danger of losing information when you turn
off your computer.

SMARTDrive works closely with Windows to conserve space, saving information
in memory only if that information is needed. For example, if you quit an
application, SMARTDrive removes any information used by that application
and makes the space available for the next application you start.

SMARTDrive and Other Disk Programs



________________________________________
Replacing other memory-disk programs

When running Windows, you should use SMARTDrive as a replacement for any
memory-disk program (such as VDISK) or any disk-caching program (such as
Vcache or LIGHTNING). Although these programs are designed to make use of
your expanded or extended memory, none is designed to work with Windows to
make the best use of the memory in your computer.

If you are already using a memory-disk or disk-caching program, you must
modify your CONFIG.SYS file to remove any command lines associated with
that program. See the documentation provided with the program for
information about its CONFIG.SYS command lines.

___________________________________________________________________________
Using SMARTDrive for Swapping

SMARTDrive automatically provides its time-saving features whenever you
specify your hard disk as the swap disk for standard-application swapping.
There are no special settings required in your WIN.INI file to make
SMARTDrive work. SMARTDrive carries out its work transparently.

Setting Up SMARTDrive



________________________________________
Running SMARTDrive

To set up your system to use SMARTDrive, follow these steps:


1 Install your expanded- or extended-memory hardware according to the
  manufacturer's instructions.


2 Add an appropriate SMARTDrive command line to your CONFIG.SYS file. The
  command-line format is described in the following section.

  If you do not have a CONFIG.SYS file, use a text editor to create one in
  your hard disk's root directory. For information about CONFIG.SYS, see
  your DOS reference manual.

  If you have an expanded memory board, the SMARTDrive command line must
  follow any CONFIG.SYS command lines that are used to install and prepare
  the software required to use the expanded memory. For information about
  these command lines, see the documentation provided with your expanded
  memory board.


3 Delete any command lines associated with other memory-disk or disk-
  caching programs from the CONFIG.SYS file.


4 Save the CONFIG.SYS file in your hard disk's root directory.


5 Copy the SMARTDRV.SYS file from the Windows Utilities disk to the
  directory specified in your SMARTDrive command line.


6 Restart your computer to start SMARTDrive. From now on, SMARTDrive will
  start each time you start DOS.


Using the SMARTDrive Command Line



________________________________________
The SMARTDrive command line

You add a SMARTDrive command line to your CONFIG.SYS file to tell your
computer where the SMARTDrive program file is, how much memory you want
SMARTDrive to use, and whether SMARTDrive should use expanded or extended
memory. In the following description of the SMARTDrive command line,
brackets ([ ]) surround optional fields and italics represent names to be
typed exactly as shown (any combination of uppercase and lowercase can be
used).

The SMARTDrive command line has the following form:

device=[d:][path]smartdrv.sys [size] [/a]

DEVICE=  Tells DOS to install a device driver. In this case, SMARTDrive is
the device-driver program.

d:  The disk drive where you store the SMARTDRV.SYS file. If the file is on
the disk you use to start DOS, you don't need to include a disk-drive
designation.

path  The directory where you store the SMARTDRV.SYS file. If the file is
in the directory you use to start DOS, you don't need to include a
pathname.

SMARTDRV.SYS  The name of the SMARTDrive program file. You must include
this part of the command line.

size  The amount of memory you want SMARTDrive to have. If you don't
specify an amount of memory, SMARTDrive will receive 256K (the default
size). If you plan to run a standard application that uses expanded or
extended memory, you should specify a size that leaves enough memory for
that application.

/A  Use this switch if you have expanded memory or if you want to use your
extended memory board as expanded memory.

Sample SMARTDrive Command Lines



________________________________________
SMARTDrive samples

The following are two sample SMARTDrive command lines with explanations of
their effects.

Sample One


   _________________
   _________________

This command line gives SMARTDrive 1024K (one megabyte) of expanded memory.
DOS looks for the SMARTDRV.SYS file in the WIN directory on drive C:.

When SMARTDrive is set up, the following message will appear:

Microsoft SMARTDrive RAM Cache version x.xx
Cache Size: yyyyK in Expanded Memory

In this message, yyyyK is the amount of memory in kilobytes that SMARTDrive
was able to obtain.

If the memory specified is not all of the available memory, then the memory
remaining can be used by other programs running with Windows.

Sample Two


   _________________

This command line gives SMARTDrive all available extended memory. DOS looks
for the SMARTDRV.SYS file in the drive or directory you start DOS from.

When SMARTDrive is set up, the following message will appear:

Microsoft SMARTDrive RAM Cache version x.xx
Cache Size: yyyyK in 80286 Extended Memory

In this message, yyyyK is the amount of memory in kilobytes that SMARTDrive
was able to obtain.

___________________________________________________________________________
SMARTDrive Messages

The following messages may appear when you start the SMARTDrive program.
Most messages indicate some problem that needs correction before SMARTDrive
can be installed and operate properly. Messages are listed in alphabetical
order.

Bad or missing d:path SMARTDRV.SYS
o The drive letter (d:) or the pathname (path) is incorrect. The
  SMARTDRV.SYS file is not in the drive or directory shown in the
  SMARTDrive command line.
  Edit your CONFIG.SYS file and type the correct drive and pathname in the
  SMARTDrive line.

Microsoft SMARTDrive RAM Cache version x.xx
Cache Size: yyyyK in Expanded Memory
o This SMARTDrive message appears when DOS sets up SMARTDrive; x.xx is the
  version of SMARTDrive and yyyy is the amount of memory in kilobytes that
  SMARTDrive was able to obtain.

SMARTDrive: Expanded Memory Manager not present
o You included the /A switch in the SMARTDrive command line but SMARTDrive
  could not find the expanded memory man-
  ager. Your system boot disk did not install the expanded memory manager.
  Your CONFIG.SYS file did not contain the appropriate information.
  Consult the documentation for your expanded memory hard-
  ware for correct installation instructions.

SMARTDrive: Expanded Memory Manager Status shows error
o While trying to set up SMARTDrive in expanded memory, DOS detected an
  error. DOS will not install the SMARTDrive program.
  Run your expanded memory diagnostics to check your expanded memory. Take
  the appropriate corrective action as instructed in your expanded memory
  manual.

SMARTDrive:  Computer must be PC-AT, or PC-AT
compatible
o You do not have extended memory because you don't have an IBM PC AT or PC
  ATcompatible computer. DOS will not install the SMARTDrive program.
  If you have expanded memory, use /A on the SMARTDrive command line. If
  you have neither extended nor expanded memory, you can't use SMARTDrive.

SMARTDrive:  Incorrect DOS version
o SMARTDrive runs only on 2.x and 3.x versions of DOS. DOS will not install
  the SMARTDrive program.
  Because Microsoft Windows requires DOS 2.x or later, you need to switch
  to a 2.x or later version of DOS so that you can run Windows as well as
  SMARTDrive.

SMARTDrive:  Insufficient memory
o Your system has insufficient memory available for SMARTDrive. DOS will
  not install the SMARTDrive program.
  If you want to use the SMARTDrive program, you must add memory to your
  system.

SMARTDrive:  Invalid parameter
o The command line contains too many parts, such as more than one number or
  more than one pathname.

o The size number is out of the range of permitted numbers. For example,
  you may have the SMARTDrive size set for 8K, which is too small. DOS will
  not install the SMARTDrive program.
  Edit your CONFIG.SYS file and change the incorrect SMARTDrive line.

SMARTDrive: I/O error accessing drive memory
o DOS detected an error while trying to set up SMARTDrive. DOS will not
  install the SMARTDrive program.
  Run memory tests to check the memory where SMARTDrive is set up.

SMARTDrive:  No extended memory available
o Your system has no memory available for SMARTDrive. DOS will not install
  the SMARTDrive program.
  If you want to use the SMARTDrive program, you must add memory to your
  system.

SMARTDrive:  No hard drives in system
o Your system has no hard disk. DOS will not install the SMARTDrive
  program. SMARTDrive only works with hard disks.
  If you want to use the SMARTDrive program, you must add a hard disk to
  your system.

SMARTDrive:  Too many bytes per track on hard drive
o Your system has a hard disk that SMARTDrive does not understand. DOS will
  not install the SMARTDrive program.
  You can't use SMARTDrive on your system.
