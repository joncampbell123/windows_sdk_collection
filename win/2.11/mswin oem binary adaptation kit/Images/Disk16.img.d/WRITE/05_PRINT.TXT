5 Printing a Document

When you are ready to print a document, use the Print command from the File
menu to send the document to the printer. If you want to see where
Microsoft Windows Write will break the pages before you print, use the
Repaginate command to paginate the document. Write also has a Change
Printer command that lets you switch to a different printer before you
start printing. This chapter describes how to perform all of these
commands.

___________________________________________________________________________
Using the Print Command

When you print a document, you can specify the number of copies and the
range of pages you want to print. Write proposes printing one copy of the
entire document. If you want to change the preset margins before you print
the document, use the Page Layout command. For more information on changing
margins, see Chapter 3, Formatting Your Work.

Printing a document

To print a document, follow these steps:


1 Select the File menu and choose the Print command.

  You will see this dialog box:

To resume printing after a pause, select the Controls menu and choose the
Resume command. For more information on printing, see the Microsoft Windows
User's Guide.

Printing large files


Note You may have to disable Spooler in order to print large files. To do
this, change the Spooler= line in the [windows] section of your WIN.INI
file to read spooler=no.  Then restart Windows. When you print a file,
Spooler will not be used (Write will send the file directly to the
printer), and you will not be able to pause or restart printing, though you
will be able to cancel it.

Using hyphens


___________________________________________________________________________
Hyphenation

Write recognizes two kinds of hyphens, both of which you need to enter by
hand. Write doesn't hyphenate automatically.

Normal hyphens are always visible. Use them for those hyphens you always
want to appear; for example, in words such as long-range.  Write breaks at
normal hyphens that appear at the end of a line.

To insert a normal hyphen, simply type a dash in the desired
location.

Optional hyphens are invisible unless they appear at the end of a line. Use
them to specify correct hyphenation points in words.

To insert optional hyphens, follow this procedure:


1 Press CONTROL+SHIFT+DASH at each desired hyphenation point.

Paginating

Paginating is the process of breaking a document into pages. Write
paginates a document for you automatically when you print it. Write
controls pagination so that a single line in a paragraph is not printed by
itself at the top or bottom of a page.

If you know you want a new page to start at a specific place, you can
insert a page break.

Inserting a page break

To insert a page break, follow these steps:


1 Position the insertion point where you want the page break
  to occur.

2 Press CONTROL+ENTER.

Paginating a document

You can use the Repaginate command on the File menu to paginate a document.
Then you can preview the page breaks on the screen before you print the
document. The Repaginate command has an option called Confirm Page Breaks.
It lets you approve or move each page break Write proposes during
pagination.

After pagination, two arrows (>>) in the left margin indicate the first new
line of each page. The page breaks that you move or insert yourself appear
as a dotted line across the document, followed by the two arrows. The
dotted line can be selected, deleted, or copied just like any other
character.

To paginate a document, follow these steps:


1 Select the File menu and choose the Repaginate command.

  You will see this dialog box:

    ______________________________




    ______________________________



2 Select the Confirm Page Breaks check box if you want to approve each page
  break during pagination.


3 Choose the OK button.

If you elected to confirm page breaks, you will see this dialog box at each
page break:

  ______________________________


















  ______________________________


Note You cannot move a page break down from where Write proposes it. If you
do not like the page break, you must move it up. Use the Down button if you
move the page break up too far and want to move it back.

The Repaginate command does not change a page break you inserted with
CONTROL+ENTER. However, while you are confirming page breaks, Write stops
at each page break you have inserted and asks if you want to keep or remove
it.

After a document has been paginated, you can jump to a specific page with
the Go To Page command from the Search menu. This is a quick way to scroll
through a long document once it has been paginated. For more information on
the Go To Page command, see Chapter 2, Editing a Document.

Changing the Printer

Write prints your documents on the active printer. The active printer is
the printer you installed with Windows. If you have installed more than one
printer, you can change to a different printer in Write with the Change
Printer command. The printer you change to then becomes the active printer.

The Change Printer command lists all the printers you installed with
Windows during setup and also with the Add New Printer command in the
control panel.

You can change printers in order to print on a different printer, or just
to format your document for a different printer. The printer you change to
need not be physically connected to your computer, but it must be installed
in Windows.

When you change printers, the appearance of your document may change on the
screen. This is because Write applies the fonts and character formats
available with the active printer. These changes may affect the line breaks
and page breaks in the document. If you change printers and want to see the
new page breaks, use the Repaginate command.
