2 Editing a Document

This chapter tells you how to type and edit text with Microsoft Windows
Write. Editing techniques include deleting, inserting, moving, and finding
text. You can practice each technique by working through the sections
called Now Try This.

________________________________________
Typing text into a document


___________________________________________________________________________
Typing Text

To type text with Write, start the program, then start typing. There are
several things to keep in mind:


o As you type, text appears to the left of the blinking insertion point.


o If you make a typing mistake, press the BACKSPACE key. It erases
  characters as it backs over them.


o Press the ENTER key only when you want to begin a new paragraph, leave
  some blank lines, or begin a new line before you reach the right margin.

  You do not need to press the ENTER key when you reach the end of each
  line because Write automatically starts the next line for you. This is
  called wordwrap. Each time you reach the right margin, the insertion
  point and the word you are typing automatically move to the next line.


Now Try This



1 Start Write as described in the Introduction.


2 Type the following paragraph. Do not press the ENTER key as you type. To
  erase typing mistakes, press the BACKSPACE key.


  ______________________________




  ______________________________

The text on your screen may not look exactly like the text
shown here. This is because Write displays text in different fonts,
depending on the active printer. For more information, see the Appendix,
Fonts and the Active Printer.

___________________________________________________________________________
Scrolling and Selecting Text

Scrolling is the process of moving the document text through
the window. Selecting is the process of highlighting text on the screen.
You want to be able to scroll efficiently so you can go where you want in
the document. You want to be able to select text easily because many
commands and actions with Write require you to first select text.

one
character   Select the text, then start
            typing. The selected text is deleted and the text you type
            is inserted in its place.

When you delete a selection with the Cut command or withSHIFT+DELETE, you
remove the text from the document and put it on
Clipboard.

Using Clipboard


________________________________________
Using Clipboard

Clipboard holds information that you delete or copy from applications
running with Windows. While text is on Clipboard, you can paste it
elsewhere on your Write document. You can also paste the contents of
Clipboard onto another Write document or onto another Windows application.

When you put information on Clipboard, it stays there until you choose Cut
or Copy again. Pasting the information from Clipboard onto a document or
other application does not remove the contents of Clipboard. You can also
use Clipboard to move or copy graphics and text into your Write document
from other Windows applications. For more information, see Chapter 4,
Pasting from Other Applications. For more information on pasting text from
Clipboard, see Inserting Text and Moving and Copying Text later in this
chapter.

If you wish, you can expand Clipboard to see its contents. To do so, run
CLIPBRD.EXE from MS-DOS Executive. For more information about Clipboard,
see the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.

Now Try This

Delete sentences from the real estate listing by following these steps:


1 Select the first two sentences in the paragraph, as shown.


2 Select the Edit menu and choose the Cut command, or press the DELETE key.

o By typing the text


o By inserting text from Clipboard


________________________________________
Inserting text by typing

To insert text by typing, follow these steps:


1 Move the insertion point to where you want to insert the text.


2 Type the text.

  The text to the right of the insertion point moves over as you type the
  new text.

Moving and Copying Text

Moving text means that you delete it from its original location in a
document and insert it at a new location. Copying text means that you take
a copy of some text without deleting the original text, and insert it at
another location. Both actions use Clipboard to hold the text while you
move or copy it.

You can move or copy text


o Within a document


o Between Write documents


o Between Write and other Windows applications

You can also paste text and graphics from other applications into your
Write documents. For more information, see Chapter 4, Pasting from Other
Applications.

___________________________________________________________________________
Finding and Changing Text

You can easily locate text and change it with the commands in the Search
menu. You can


o Search for text up to 255 characters in length.


o Change all occurrences of the text in a document.


o Change only those occurrences you want to.


Finding Text

Use the Find command to look for a character, word, or group
of characters or words. The Find command starts at the insertion point or
at the end of the selection and goes to the end of the document. Then Find
goes back to the beginning of the document and continues searching to the
insertion point or to the end of the selection.


________________________________________
Finding text

To find text, follow these steps:


1 Select the Search menu and choose the Find command.

  You will see this dialog box:

    ______________________________












    ______________________________


2 Choose the Find Next button to start the search, or press the ENTER key.

Write searches for the text and selects the first occurrence, if there is
one. If there are no occurrences of the text in the document, you see a
dialog box that says Search text not found.

To continue the search after an occurrence is selected, use this procedure:


1 Choose the Find Next button again.

When all occurrences of the search text have been found, you see a dialog
box that says Search complete.

You can search for text using a question mark (?) to match any single
character. For example, if the search text is hea?, you might find head,
heal, heap, hear, or heat.

To search for text that includes spaces, tabs, paragraph marks, and page
breaks, type these special characters in the search text:



Type     To stand for
___________________________________________________________________________

^w       White space. Searches for any combination of spaces, tab
         characters, paragraph marks, and page breaks.

^t       Tab character.

^p       Paragraph mark.

^d       Page break.


Note You can also use the preceding characters (except for ^w) when you
find and change text with the Change command. For more information, see
Changing Text later in this chapter.

When you are finished finding text, close the Find dialog box.

To close the Find dialog box, use the following procedure:


1 Press the ESCAPE key, or select the Control menu on the Find dialog box,
  and choose the Close command.


Editing Between Finds

Often you want to edit the document after you find each occurrence of the
search text. You can either press ALT+F6 to switch between the Find (or
Change) dialog box and the Write window, or close the Find dialog box after
finding the first occurrence, and then use the Repeat Last Find command.

With the Repeat Last Find command, you can continue searching for text with
or without the Find dialog box on the screen. The Repeat Last Find command
finds the next occurrence of the search text used in the last Find command.
The shortcut key for the Repeat Last Find command is the F3 key. You can
search quickly through a document by pressing the F3 key repeatedly.


________________________________________
Editing between finds

To edit between finds, follow these steps:


1 Use the Find command to find the first occurrence of the search text.


2 Close the Find dialog box.


3 Edit the document.


4 Select the Search menu and choose the Repeat Last Find command, or press
  the F3 key.

Repeat steps 3 and 4 to continue finding and editing.

Note You can also use the Repeat Last Find command after first choosing the
Change command. For more information about the Change command, see Changing
Text.


Changing Text

Use the Change command to find text and replace it with something else, or
to change all occurrences of the text automatically.

The Change command searches forward from the insertion point, then goes to
the beginning of the document and comes back to the insertion point.
However, if you select one or more characters before choosing the Change
command, the command operates only within that selection.


________________________________________
Finding and changing text automatically

To find and change text, follow these steps:


1 Select the Search menu and choose the Change command.

  You will see this dialog box:

    ______________________________












    ______________________________



2 Choose one of the buttons to start: Find Next; Change, then Find; Change;
  or Change All.


  ______________________________
  ______________________________

If there are no occurrences of the text in the document, you see
a dialog box that says Search text not found.

When the entire document has been searched, you see the message Search
complete.

When you are finished changing text, close the Change dialog box.

To close the Change dialog box, use the following procedure:


1 Press the ESCAPE key, or select the Control menu on the Change dialog box
  and choose the Close command.

Often you want to make changes in part of a document rather than the entire
document. To do this, select part of the document before you choose the
Change command. The Change command then operates only within the selection,
and the Change All button becomes the Change Selection button.


________________________________________
Changing selected text

To change text within a selection, follow these steps:


1 Select the part of the document in which you want to find and change
  text.


2 Select the Search menu and choose the Change command.


3 Fill in the Find What and Change To text boxes.


4 Choose a button to start.

  The Change Selection button changes all occurrences of the search text
  found within the selection.


Now Try This

Open the document called PRACTICE.WRI that comes on your Write disk. Be
sure to save any open documents before you open PRACTICE.WRI. If the active
document is the real estate listing, save it with the name HOUSE.


1 Choose the Open command and open the document PRACTICE.WRI.


2 Select the Search menu, and choose the Change command.


3 Type you in the Find What box.


4 Type the seller in the Change To box.


5 Choose each of the buttons in turn to see what happens.

  Find Next: finds the first occurrence of you.

  Change, then Find: changes the first occurrence of you to the seller,
  then finds the next occurrence of you.

  Change: changes that occurrence of you to the seller.

  Change All: changes the remaining occurrences of you to the seller.


6 Press the ESCAPE key to close the Change dialog box.


___________________________________________________________________________
Undoing Your Last Action

You can use the Undo command from the Edit menu to reverse your most recent
action.

When you open the Edit menu, the Undo command names
the most recent action: Undo Typing, Undo Editing, or Undo
Formatting.


________________________________________
Undoing your last action

To undo, use the following procedure:


1 Select the Edit menu and choose the Undo command, or press ALT+BACKSPACE.

If your most recent action was undo, the Undo command reverses the undo, so
you have plenty of opportunity to change your mind. Using the Undo command,
you can switch back and forth between two versions of text to see which you
prefer.
