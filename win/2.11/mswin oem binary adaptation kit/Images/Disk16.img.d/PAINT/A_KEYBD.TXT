Appendix A
Using Paint with the Keyboard


This appendix describes how you can use the keyboard to select tools, draw
objects, scroll a drawing, edit a drawing area, and take shortcuts. It also
explains how you can use the keyboard together with the mouse to enhance
some of Paint's features.

You should already have learned how to use the keyboard to choose commands
from menus. For more information on this topic, see the Microsoft Windows
User's Guide.

If you don't have a mouse, use this Appendix as a keyboard reference while
working with Paint.
