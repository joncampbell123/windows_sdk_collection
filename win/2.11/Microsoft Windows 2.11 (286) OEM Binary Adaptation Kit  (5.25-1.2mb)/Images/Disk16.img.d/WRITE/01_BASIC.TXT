1 The Basics

This chapter introduces you to the Microsoft Windows Write window. It also
describes how to open a new or existing document, how to save a document on
the disk, and how to close the Write window.

___________________________________________________________________________
The Write Window

When you start Write, the screen looks like this:

  ______________________________























  ______________________________

Note that the Write window automatically starts on top of MS-DOS Executive.
You will probably want to adjust the placement of these windows in order to
take full advantage of the screen area, and create an organization that
suits your needs. You can adjust this screen image in three ways:


o By turning MS-DOS Executive into an icon


o By enlarging the Write window


o By moving or sizing the Write Window


To learn how to perform these procedures, see the Microsoft Windows User's
Guide.

The rest of the Write windows that appear in this guide have been enlarged
with the Maximize command.

___________________________________________________________________________
Working with Documents

You can begin working with a document by selecting the File menu and
choosing the New command or Open command. The New command creates a new
untitled document. The Open command opens a document that is already stored
on your disk.

You can also open a new or existing document from MS-DOS
Executive.

Creating a New Document

When you run WRITE.EXE from MS-DOS Executive, Write begins with a new
untitled document. While you are using Write, you can create a new document
with the New command.


________________________________________
Creating a new document

To create a new document from Write, use this procedure:


1 Select the File menu and choose the New command.


Opening an Existing Document

With the Open command, you can open a document you have saved. You can also
open different disk drives and directories to gain access to documents
stored in them.


________________________________________
Opening an existing document

To open an existing document from Write, follow these steps:


1 Select the File menu and choose the Open command.

  You will see this dialog box:

    ______________________________
















    ______________________________



2 Select the name of the document you want to open.


3 Choose the Open button to complete the command.

  Or, with the mouse, double-click the name of the document you want to
  open.

If you open a document name, Write opens the document.

If you open a disk drive or directory, Write makes it the default disk
drive or directory and displays the contents in the list box. Select again
and choose the Open button. This way, you gain access to documents that are
not on the active disk drive or in the active directory.

Opening a Document from MS-DOS Executive

You can also run Write and open a document at the same time from MS-DOS
Executive. The document must be stored in the same directory as WRITE.EXE,
unless WRITE.EXE is listed in the PATH setting in your DOS AUTOEXEC.BAT
file. For more information on placing entries in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file,
refer to your DOS manual.


________________________________________
Opening a document from MS-DOS Executive

To open an existing document from the MS-DOS Executive, use this procedure:


1 Select a Write document name and press the ENTER key.

  Or, double-click the document name with the mouse.


________________________________________
Opening non-Write documents


Opening Documents That Are Not
in Write Format

When you try to open a document that was not created in Microsoft Write
format, you will see a dialog box that asks if you want to convert the
document to Write format (the Windows ANSI character set). Windows uses an
8-bit ANSI character set. This allows you to represent up to 256 characters
(0255). If the document contains characters in the 128255 range, those
characters will probably not be displayed correctly on Windows unless you
convert the document to Write format.

Typical documents not in Write format would include the
following:


o Microsoft Word documents


o Other non-Windows documents


o Write documents saved as text only, or other Windows documents


There are a couple of things to keep in mind when you convert documents:


o Make sure you back up your work before doing a conversion.


o Do not convert any binary files. In these files, characters above 127 may
  be related to the program that created the file and therefore cannot be
  converted.


The following sections describe how to open each type of
document.

________________________________________
Opening Microsoft
Word documents


Opening a Microsoft Word Document

When you try to open a document that was formatted using Microsoft Word,
you will notice that the No Conversion option in the dialog box is grayed.
Since Word documents do not use the ANSI character set, they must be
converted.

If you have any special graphic characters in your Word-formatted document,
they will not be converted. These special graphic characters do not have an
equivalent in the ANSI character set. To avoid losing any data, make a
backup of your Word-formatted document before converting it.

For Word documents that were saved as text only, select the Convert option.
Your document will be converted to the Windows ANSI character set.

________________________________________
Opening other non-Windows documents


Opening Any Other Non-Windows Document

For all other documents that were not created using Windows, select the
Convert option. Your document will be converted to the Windows ANSI
character set.

________________________________________
Opening documents in ANSI format


Opening a Write Document Saved as Text Only
or Other Windows Documents

Documents created by a Windows application are in ANSI format. If you
convert, your document will not be displayed correctly. If your document
was created using Write and saved as text only, select No Conversion from
the dialog box. Follow this same procedure for documents created by any
other Windows application.

Note If you make a mistake in selecting the Convert/No Conversion option,
simply quit Write without saving the file. Your file will be restored to
its original status.


Opening More Than One Write Window

You can have more than one Write window open at a time.


________________________________________
Opening multiple Write windows

To open an additional Write window, follow these steps:


1 Begin with a Write window open on your screen.


2
  Expand MS-DOS Executive to share the screen with the Write window.


3 Select and run WRITE.EXE.

    ______________________________
















    ______________________________



4 Open a document in the new Write window.


Note If you have the same document open in two different
windows, you will see your changes only in the window you are working in.
The document will not be updated in the other window unless you close and
reopen it.


___________________________________________________________________________
Saving a Document

When you save a document, Write stores the latest version of the document
on the disk.

You will usually want to save your Write document before you close the
Write window or open another document. It is also a good idea to save often
while you are working with Write. Saving frequently helps Write perform
faster, and it minimizes lost work if there is a power interruption.

There are two Write commands that you can use to save a document: Save As
and Save. You use the Save As command if you want to save the changes and
modify the status of the document in some way (for example, if you wanted
to name or rename the document). You use the Save command to simply save
the changes you have made to the document on screen.

The Save As Command


________________________________________
Using the Save As command

To save a document for the first time, or modify its status, use the Save
As command, as follows:


1 Select the File menu and choose the Save As command.

  The Save As dialog box appears.

    ______________________________













    ______________________________



2 Type the name you want the document to have.

  If the document already has a name, Write proposes that
  name. See Document Names, later in this section, for more
  information.


3 Choose the OK button to carry out the command, or press
  the ENTER key.


While saving, Write briefly displays the number of characters contained in
the document. The number appears in the lower-left corner of the window,
where the page status usually appears. After saving, Write returns to the
document so you can resume working.

Note If a file of the same name already exists in the directory, Write asks
if you want to replace the existing file. Choose the Yes button only if you
want to delete that file and replace it with the document you are saving.
Otherwise, choose the No button and type a different document name.


The Save Command


________________________________________
Using the Save command

To save a document as it appears on screen, use this procedure:


1 Select the File menu and choose the Save command.

Windows saves the file to disk automatically, without displaying
a dialog box. If the document does not have a name, you will see the Save
As dialog box. Follow the steps described in the Save As command.

________________________________________
Creating document names


Document Names

Keep in mind the following guidelines when you create a name for a Write
document:


o
  The characters in a document name can be letters or numbers. You can
  enter the letters in upper or lower case, but Write always displays them
  in upper case.


o A name can have up to eight characters, plus an extension. An extension
  always begins with a period and can have up to three characters.


o Write automatically adds the extension .WRI for you. This extension is a
  good way to identify all your Write documents. If you add your own
  extension when you save the document, or if you just end the name with a
  period, Write does not add .WRI.


o If you select the Microsoft Word Format option and don't type an
  extension, Write automatically adds the extension .DOC. If you add your
  own extension when you save the document, or if you end the filename with
  a period, Write does not add .DOC.


Saving More Than One Version

If you change a document, but want to keep the old version
on the disk as well as the new version, you can use the Save As
command to give the new version a slightly different name. For
example, the new version of RESUME.WRI could be named RESUME2.WRI.


________________________________________
Saving additional versions

To save more than one version of a document, follow these steps:


1 Select the File menu and choose the Save As command.


2 Type the name for the new version of the document in the text box.


3 Choose the OK button to carry out the command.


________________________________________
Saving backup copies


Saving a Backup Copy

When you save a file in Write, the Make Backup check box is selected by
default. This ensures that you make a backup copy each time you work with
an existing document. If you converted the document to Write format when
you opened it, the backup will be the original (unconverted) document.

Note When you save a Write document as a Word document, any pictures will
disappear.


________________________________________
Making a backup of a Write document


Backing Up a Write Document

When making a backup of an existing Write document (extension .WRI), you
can choose to do any of the following:


o Save the document as a Windows Write document. The backup file has the
  extension .BKP.


o Save the document as a Microsoft Word-formatted document. The backup file
  has the extension .BKP.


o Save the document as a Microsoft Word-formatted document, but delete the
  extension proposed by the Save dialog box (.WRI). The document will be
  saved with the extension .DOC. The backup file will have the extension
  .WRI. The backup is the original Write-formatted document.


________________________________________
Making a backup of a Microsoft Word document


Backing Up a Microsoft Word Document

When making a backup of an existing Microsoft Word document (extension
.DOC), you can do one of the following.  (Since it is a Microsoft Word
document, you can assume you converted it to the Write ANSI format when you
opened it.)


o Save the document as a Microsoft Word-formatted document. The backup file
  will have the extension .BAK.


o Save the document as a Windows Write document. The backup file will have
  the extension .BAK.


o Save the document as a Windows Write-formatted document, but delete the
  extension proposed by the Save dialog box (.DOC). The document will be
  saved with the extension .WRI. The backup file will have the extension
  .DOC. The backup is the original Microsoft Word-formatted document.


________________________________________
Saving a Write document in different formats


Saving in Different Formats

You have four formatting choices when saving a Write document:


o Save the document as a Write-formatted document.

  Choose the Save button or press the ENTER key.


o Save the document as a Microsoft Word-formatted document.

  Select the Microsoft Word Format check box, then choose the Save button
  or press the ENTER key. The document will be saved as Microsoft Word-
  formatted text.

  Note When you save a Write document as a Word document, any pictures will
  disappear.



o Save the document without formatting (as a Windows ANSI text file).

  Select the Text Only check box, then choose the Save button or press the
  ENTER key.


o Save the document as a Microsoft Word text file (non-formatted).

  Select both the Text Only and Microsoft Word Format check boxes, then
  choose the Save button or press the ENTER key. Your document will not be
  saved in the Windows ANSI format.


Saving to a Different Disk Drive

Normally, Write saves documents to the active disk drive, which is the
drive containing WRITE.EXE. If you have a hard disk, you can save to a
different disk drive by preceding the document name with the drive letter
and a colon.

Note If you have a two-drive floppy disk system, do not save to a different
disk. You must always save your documents on the Write disk. If you have a
hard disk system you may save to a disk in drive A or B.


________________________________________
Saving to a different disk drive

To save to a different disk, follow these steps:


1 Select the File menu and choose the Save As command.


2 Type the name of the document preceded by a letter and colon for the
  drive you want to save to.

  For example, type b:resume.wri to save RESUME.WRI on the disk in drive B.


3 Choose the OK button to carry out the command.


Saving to a Subdirectory

Normally, Write saves documents to the active directory. You can save a
document to a subdirectory by preceding the document name with a
subdirectory name and a backslash.


________________________________________
Saving to a subdirectory

To save to a subdirectory, follow these steps:


1 Select the File menu and choose the Save As command.


2 Type the subdirectory name, a backslash, and the document name.

  For example, type jobs\resume.wri to save the document RESUME.WRI in the
  subdirectory JOBS. JOBS must be a subdirectory in the active directory.


3 Choose the OK button to carry out the command.

The subdirectory you specify must already have been created with MS-DOS.
Write will not create the subdirectory for you.

___________________________________________________________________________
Ending a Write Session

When you are finished using Write, close the Write window.


________________________________________
Closing the Write window

To close the Write window, use this procedure:


1 Choose Exit from the File menu.

  Or, double-click the Window menu box with the mouse.

If you have unsaved changes in the document, Write asks if you want to save
them before closing.

If you end the Windows session without closing the Write window, Windows
closes it for you. If you have unsaved changes in a Write document, Windows
asks if you want to save them before ending the session.
