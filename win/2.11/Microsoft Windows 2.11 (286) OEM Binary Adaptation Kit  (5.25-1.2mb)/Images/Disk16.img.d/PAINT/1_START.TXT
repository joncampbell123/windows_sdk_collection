1 Getting Started

In this chapter, you will learn how to start Paint and prepare for drawing.
You will also find instructions on how to create and use an optional work
disk. Once you've started Paint, read the section called Some Definitions
to get acquainted with the Paint screen and the terminology used in this
guide.

___________________________________________________________________________
Starting Paint

Paint is a Windows application and will therefore run only when Windows is
installed and running on your system. If you have not yet installed
Windows, see the Microsoft Windows User's Guide for information on how to
install and start it.


________________________________________
Running Paint

Here's what you do to start Paint:


1 Start Windows. If the PAINT.EXE file is not in the current directory,
  change directories to the directory that contains it. If PAINT.EXE is not
  on the current disk, change disks to the disk that contains it.


2 Select PAINT.EXE from the directory listing in the MS-DOS Executive
  window.


3 Press the ENTER key or double-click the mouse button.

The Paint window appears on your screen.


Creating a Work Disk


________________________________________
Using work disks on systems with limited space

On systems with limited disk space, you may need to create a work disk for
creating and storing your Paint drawings before you start Paint. A work
disk contains a copy of the PAINT.EXE file as well as copies of all the
drawings you have created and saved. You'll need a work disk if you don't
have enough disk space for at
least one drawing and a Paint temporary file. (For many systems, this is
about 20K, but your system may require more space.) To make a work disk,
you will need to format a blank disk and then copy the PAINT.EXE file to
it. See the Microsoft Windows User's Guide for information on how to format
a disk and copy files.

In step 1 in the preceding procedure, change disks to the work disk, and
proceed with steps 2 and 3.

Some Definitions

After you have started Paint, the Paint window will look like this:

   _________________

   _________________

If you've been using color while working in Windows, you will notice that
your screen is now in black and white. Paint is a monochrome program
designed for creating black and white drawings.

Definitions

These definitions may be helpful as you begin to use Paint:


o The drawing window frames the portion of your drawing that appears on the
  screen. All your Paint activities take place within the drawing window.

  Keep in mind that your drawings can be larger than the drawing window.
  The exact size of the drawing area depends on the maximum surface area
  that your printer can print on.


o The title bar contains the title of your drawing.


o The menu bar contains the names of Paint's command menus.


o The Tools palette contains the implements you use to draw and refine your
  artwork.


o The status box shows the tool, paint pattern, brush shape, and line width
  that Paint will use when you draw. It reflects the most recent choices
  you made from the Tools, Patterns, Brush Shapes, and Line Widths
  palettes.

o The pointer is the indicator you use to draw objects and select menus,
  commands, and palette items. The pointer changes shape in the drawing
  window whenever you select a tool.


o To drag means to press the mouse button and hold it down while you move
  the mouse on a flat surface.

Preparing to Draw


________________________________________
Choosing the display option

After you have started Paint, you need to prepare Paint for drawing by
choosing where you would like your drawings to be ultimately displayed-on
your screen or on paper. The following list explains how to make your
choice:




For            Do this
___________________________________________________________________________

Drawings that  Select the Options menu and choose the For Screen command
you will view
only on your
screen

Drawings you   Select the Options menu and choose the For Printer command
can print

Drawings you   Select the Options menu and choose the For Printer command
can paste in
other
applications

The For Screen command adjusts the drawing area so that it is the same size
as your full screen. The For Printer command adjusts the drawing area so
that it matches your printer's paper size.

Note Before selecting the For Printer command, use Control Panel to install
and set up your printer if you have not already done so or if you have
changed printers. Note that the drawings you create are printer-specific.
See the Microsoft Windows User's Guide for more information about Control
Panel and setting up a printer.

Once you choose the For Screen or For Printer command and then start
drawing, you cannot change the command unless you restart Paint or begin a
new drawing using the New command.
If you open an existing drawing file, Paint uses the options that were set
when you first created the drawing while you are making your changes.


________________________________________
Choosing the resolution

If you choose the For Printer command, you can then choose the resolution
of the drawings you will be creating. The following list explains how to
choose the resolution:




For            Do this
___________________________________________________________________________

Drawings with  Select the Options menu and choose the High Resolution
the finest     command
detail and
smoothest
curves

Drawings with  Select the Options menu and choose the Low Resolution
coarse detail  command

The High Resolution command lets you create the sharpest pos- sible
drawings on your printer by giving you access to the great- est number of
dots per inch when printing. Although drawings created with the Low
Resolution command have less detail than high-resolution drawings, they
typically print much faster.

Note that some printers do not permit high-resolution drawings. for such
printers, the High Resolution command will appear gray in the menu and will
have no effect when you choose it.


________________________________________
When circles look like ovals

If you choose the For Printer command, objects may appear a little
distorted when you draw them on the screen. For ex- ample, circles may look
like ovals. There is no need to be con- cerned about this; Paint is
adjusting for differences in aspect
ratio between your printer and the display you are using. When
you actually print your drawing, the objects you have created
will print correctly.
