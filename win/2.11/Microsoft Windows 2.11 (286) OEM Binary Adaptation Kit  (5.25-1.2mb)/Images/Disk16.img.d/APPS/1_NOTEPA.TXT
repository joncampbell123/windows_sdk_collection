1 Notepad


________________________________________

Microsoft Windows Notepad is a text editor you can use to create, modify,
and display text files. Although Notepad is primarily a place to jot down
notes or short memos, you can also use Notepad to create and edit batch
files and to edit your WIN.INI file.

___________________________________________________________________________
Starting Notepad


________________________________________
Running Notepad

Here's how you start Notepad:


1 Select and run NOTEPAD.EXE in the MS-DOS Executive window.

When you start Notepad, it automatically creates an empty, untitled window
where you can start typing text.

Typing and Formatting Text


________________________________________
Typing text

You can type in the Notepad window whenever it is active; just start
typing. The insertion point moves to the right as you type.

If your typing goes beyond the borders of the window, Notepad automatically
scrolls the text to the left so that the insertion point always remains
visible in the window.


Wrapping Text

If you don't want the text you type to go beyond the borders of the window,
you can set the Word Wrap option. This option automatically wraps text at
the right edge of the window so that you do not need to press the ENTER key
at the end of each line.


________________________________________
Setting the Word Wrap option

Here's how you set the Word Wrap option:


1 Select the Edit menu and choose the Word Wrap command.

  After you've set the Word Wrap option, a checkmark will appear by the
  Word Wrap command the next time you select the Edit menu.


Here's how you cancel the Word Wrap option:


1 Select the Edit menu and choose the Word Wrap command.



Moving the Insertion Point

When you start Notepad or open a file in the Notepad window, the insertion
point initially appears in the upper-left corner. If you work in another
window and then come back to Notepad, the insertion point reappears where
you left it. You can move the insertion point to wherever you want to
insert or edit text.

___________________________________________________________________________
Editing in Notepad

You edit text in the Notepad window using commands from the Edit menu. You
can delete text, move or copy text to a new location, and search for text
within a Notepad file. If you change your mind after editing, you can
cancel your last edit.

You can also transfer text between Notepad and other applications by using
Clipboard. When you delete or copy text using the Notepad Cut or Copy
command, Notepad puts the text on the Clipboard. The Notepad Paste command
copies information from the Clipboard to your Notepad file.

For more information about Clipboard, see the Microsoft Windows User's
Guide.

Selecting Text

Before you use a command from the Edit menu to edit text, you must first
select the text you want to affect.

1 Select the Edit menu and choose the Select All command.


Replacing Text

Once you've selected the text you want to change, you can replace it
immediately by typing the new text. The selected text is deleted as soon as
you type the first character of the replacement text.


________________________________________

later in the section Undoing an Edit.

Moving Text

You can move text from one place to another in a Notepad file by first
putting it on the Clipboard using the Cut command and then pasting it to
its new location using the Paste command.


________________________________________
Relocating text

Follow these steps to move text:


1 Select the text you want to move.

You can paste text from the Clipboard to any part of any document. Note,
however, that each time you put something on the Clipboard, it replaces
whatever was previously there.

Copying Text

If you want to use the same text more than once in a document, you don't
have to type it over each time. You can copy the text to the Clipboard with
the Copy command from the Edit menu; then you can paste the text in as many
places as you want by using the Paste command.


________________________________________
Duplicating text

  selected text to the Clipboard.

3 Move the insertion point to the area where you want the copied text to
  appear.


4 Select the Edit menu and choose the Paste command.


Undoing an Edit

You can use the Undo command to cancel the last edit you made. For example,
you may have deleted text that you wanted to keep, or you may have copied
text to the wrong place. Choosing Undo immediately after your last edit
restores the text to the way it was before you changed it.


________________________________________

Finding Text

You can find specific text in a Notepad file by using the Find commands
from the Search menu. When you use a Find command, you can start the search
at any point in a file. You can also specify whether Notepad should match
the uppercase and lowercase characters of the text you specify.


________________________________________
Searching for
specific text

Follow these steps to find text:


1 Move the insertion point to the area where you want the search to begin.


2 Select the Search menu and choose the Find command. Notepad displays the
  Search For dialog box.

     _________________






     _________________



3 In the Search For text box, type the characters or words you want Notepad
  to find.


4 Notepad is preset to ignore capitalization when it searches for text. If
  you want to find only occurrences with the same arrangement of uppercase
  and lowercase letters you typed, turn on the Match Case check box.


5
  Choose the OK button.

  Notepad searches forward from the insertion point and selects the first
  occurrence of the specified text or tells you if the text does not occur
  after the insertion point.

To find further occurrences of the specified text, select the Search menu
and choose the Find Next command.

If you choose the Find Next command, Notepad does not display the Search
For dialog box but immediately searches for the last text you typed in the
Search For text box.

___________________________________________________________________________
Working with Notepad Files

You create, open, save, and print Notepad files with commands from the File
menu in the Notepad window. You delete Notepad files with commands from the
File menu in the MS-DOS Executive window.

Determining File Size

As you work on a file, Notepad keeps track of how big it is. Notepad shows
the size of the file as the percentage of free space. When a file has less
than 10 percent free space, you should consider splitting the file and
working on it as two different files.


________________________________________
Determining free space

Here's how you find out a file's free space:


1 Select the File menu and choose the About Notepad command. Notepad
  displays an informational dialog box that includes a listing of the
  amount of free space.


2 When you have finished reading the information displayed in the dialog
  box, choose the OK button.


Opening a File

You can open a new or an existing file in the Notepad window. If you open a
file when there is another file already open, Notepad closes the current
file. If you have unsaved changes in the current file, a dialog box asks if
you want to save your changes before closing the file. Use the following
information to determine your response:



To          Choose
___________________________________________________________________________

Opening an Existing File

Although you can open any file in Notepad, opening the wrong file could
cause serious problems, including a loss of information or applications.
You should open only text (ASCII) files. Windows text files generally have
one of the following extensions: .TXT, .BAT, or .INI. You can open an
existing file either from the Note- pad window or from the MS-DOS Executive
window.


________________________________________
Opening files from Notepad

To open an existing file from the Notepad window, follow these steps:

Creating a Time Log File


________________________________________
Keeping a time log

You can use Notepad to create a log to keep track of how you spend your
time:


1 Type .LOG in capital letters as the first line in a Notepad file. Notepad
  automatically adds the current time and date to the end of the file every
  time you open it.

(Notepad uses the time and date you set when you start your computer. You
can reset the time and date using Control Panel. For details on Control
Panel, see the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.)

To add the current time and date to a file you already have open, do the
following:


1 Select the Edit menu and choose the Time/Date command.

To keep an accurate log of how you spend your day, type notes about your
daily activities after each time and date.

Viewing a File in Another Directory

The Open dialog box initially lists only drives, directories, and files
with the .TXT extension. You can view different files or groups of files as
well.


________________________________________
Viewing files in different directories

To view different files, follow these steps:


1 Select the drive, directory, or group of files you want to view from the
  list box, or type this information in the text box at the top of the Open
  dialog box. For example, you can type *.bat to see a list of all the
  files having that extension.


2
  Choose the Open button.

  The Open dialog box lists the files in the drive, directory, or group of
  files you specified.

You can view any number of directories or groups of files. The Open dialog
box remains on the screen until you open a file or choose the Cancel
button.

Saving a File

When you create a new file, or when you have finished working in a file for
the moment, you can save it and come back to it later. There are two
commands you can use to save a Notepad file: Save As and Save.

Saving a New File

Use the Save As command to name and save a new file. You can also use Save
As to save the current file under a new filename, and keep the original
copy of the file on your disk under the old filename.


________________________________________
Saving new files

Follow these steps to save a new file:


1 Select the File menu and choose the Save As command. Notepad displays the
  Save As dialog box.

     _________________





     _________________



2 Type a filename for the file in the text box. If you don't type an
  extension, Notepad automatically adds .TXT to the filename.


3 Choose the OK button.

  Notepad saves the file on your disk.

The file remains on the screen so that you can continue working in it, and
the name of the file now appears in the title bar of the Notepad window.


Note If you type the name of a file that already exists, a dialog box asks
if you want to replace the existing file with the file you are saving. If
you want to replace the existing file, choose the Yes button. Otherwise,
choose the No button and type a different filename.


Saving Changes

The Save command saves the changes you made to the current file on your
disk.


________________________________________
Saving file changes
To save changes to the current file, do the following:


1 Select the File menu and choose the Save command.

  Notepad replaces the file on your disk with the current file.

If you have connected and installed a printer, you can print your Notepad
files. See the Microsoft Windows User's Guide for information about
installing printers.


________________________________________
Printing files

To print the current file, follow this step:


1 Select the File menu and choose the Print command.
