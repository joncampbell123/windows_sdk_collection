Introduction

Microsoft(R) Windows comes with seven desktop applications that make
working at your desk more efficient and more enjoyable.

You can use these applications to jot down notes, write memos, schedule

from online information services. You can also move and copy information
from one desktop application to another.

You can even take a break with Reversi-a unique and challenging game that
you play with your computer.
