Appendix B
System Messages

This appendix describes the messages that may appear with Microsoft Windows
in the middle of your window or MS-DOS Executive screen. Messages are
divided into two sections: those that are generated by Windows and those
that are generated by MS-DOS Executive. The messages are listed
alphabetically within each section.

Many of the messages appear in dialog boxes that have an OK and a Cancel
button. Choose OK to make the dialog box and the message disappear before
you proceed. Some dialog boxes include a Retry button. Choose this if you
want to try the operation again.

MS-DOS Executive Messages


Application still active
o A standard application is still open. This message will appear if you
  attempt to end the Windows session while a standard application is still
  running.
  Quit any standard applications that may be running. Use the application's
  quit or exit command.

Cannot change directory to name
o You have specified a filename instead of a directory name.
  Select or type a directory name, then retry the Change Directory command.

Cannot copy file to itself
o You have attempted to copy a file to the same filename on the same disk
  or in the same directory. This is not allowed because it would destroy
  the file.
  Copy the file again, specifying a different filename.

Cannot copy more than one file to a single file
o You have selected more than one filename and specified a single file as
  the destination.
  Select the file you want to copy and start again. To copy multiple files,
  specify a directory to copy them into.

Cannot create directory directory name
o You tried to create a directory using a name that already exists in the
  current directory.
  Retry the command with a unique directory name.

o You tried to create a directory on a disk that is write-protected.

  Remove the write-protection tab, then retry the command.

Cannot create filename
o You tried to save your work to a read-only file.
  Specify another filename when you save your work.

Cannot delete filename
o You have tried to delete a file on a write-protected disk.
  Remove the write-protection tab and try again.

o You have tried to delete a read-only file.
  You cannot delete the file.

Cannot delete the current directory
o You have attempted to delete the current directory. This is not allowed,
  even if the directory is empty.
  Move to the parent directory and start again.

Cannot find filename
o You have chosen an action that requires a file, and MS-DOS Executive
  cannot find the file in the directory or on the disk.
  Make sure you typed the filename correctly. You may need to change
  directories to locate the file, or you may need to type
  the file's pathname. If the file is not on the disk, insert the disk that
  contains the file in the drive. Choose the command and try again.

Cannot format diskette
o The disk is probably defective or read-only.
  Replace the disk and try again.

Cannot print
o Your printer is not properly installed (this includes having proper
  settings in the WIN.INI file).
  Check the printer connections and Control Panel printer settings. Set
  your printer up properly and start again. (See Chapter 7, Using Control
  Panel, for details about printer settings.)

Cannot put DOS system on the diskette
o The disk cannot be formatted with the system files.
  Put a blank formatted disk in the drive and retry the command.

Cannot rename name
o The specified file does not exist in the current directory or on the
  disk.
  Make sure the filename exists, then retry the Rename command. You cannot
  rename a directory.

Cannot run filename
o An error has occurred while running a program.
  Retry the Run command. If the command still does not work, be sure you
  are trying to run the correct file.

Cannot run with other applications
o The program you selected is a special application that loads and stays
  resident or has the Modifies Memory option set in its PIF file.
  You must close all applications except MS-DOS Executive before you can
  start this program.

Cannot set volume name
o The disk is write-protected.
  Remove the write-protection tab.

o The disk is full.
  Check the directory to see if any files can be removed, then try again.


Cannot start this application
o The standard application you are attempting to run cannot be run because
  of an internal error.
  Try to start the application again. If unsuccessful, check to be sure the
  application runs under DOS. You may need to close Windows, restart DOS,
  then restart Windows before trying the application again.

COM1 is not available
o The application you have selected requires access to serial
  communications port 1 (COM1).
  To run the program you selected, you must close any other application
  that accesses the COM1 port.

o You do not have a serial communications card installed as COM1.
  If you don't have a serial port, you cannot run the selected program.

COM2 is not available
o The application that you selected requires access to serial
  communications port 2 (COM2).
  To run the program you selected, you must close any other application
  that accesses the COM2 port.

o You do not have a serial communications card installed as COM2.
  If you don't have a serial port, you cannot run the selected program.

COM1 or COM2 is not available
o The application that you selected requires access to serial
  communications port 1 or 2 (COM1 or COM2).
  To run the program you selected, you must close any other application
  that accesses the COM1 or COM2 port.

o You do not have a serial communications card installed as COM1 or COM2.
  If you don't have a serial port, you cannot run the selected program.

Directory is not empty
o The directory that you tried to delete still contains files.
  Delete the files from the directory, or move them to a different
  location, and start again.

directory name has no files in it
o You tried to copy files from an empty directory.
  Check to see that you used the correct directory name.

Disk is full
o You have tried to save a file, or have carried out an action that
  requires creating a new file (such as copying), and the disk is full.
  Insert another disk, or delete any unwanted files and directories from
  the disk, and try again.

Initial directory not found
o The initial directory for this program cannot be found or is invalid.
  Check the PIF file for the program and be sure that the initial directory
  setting is correct.

Multiple destinations not allowed
o You have attempted to copy a single file to more than one new file, or to
  rename a single file with more than one new name.
  Copy or rename the file to a single destination.

Multiple files not allowed
o You have specified too many filenames for a command.
  Retry the command with only one filename specified.

Need more disk space
o You attempted to load a standard application that required that Windows
  swap another application to disk. There was insufficient disk space for
  swapping.
  Close one of the other standard applications you have run-
  ning and try the command again. If there is still limited space remaining
  on the swap disk, you might consider deleting some files.

Need WINOLDAP files to run program
o The program you selected requires the Windows system files WINOLDAP.MOD
  and WINOLDAP.GRB to run.
  These files should be in the same directory as your other Windows system
  files. Check the directory to make certain that they are available, and
  then try running the program again.

Not enough memory
o You have carried out an action, such as copying a file, that requires
  more memory than Windows currently has available.
  Close one or more applications and try again.

Not enough memory to display entire directory
o MS-DOS Executive requires more memory than is currently available to
  display the directory in full.
  If you want to see the entire directory, close one or more applications.

Not enough memory to run filename
o Windows tried to run a program that requires more memory than is
  currently available.
  See the following section called Not Enough Memory to Run for a detailed
  explanation of this message.

This will end your Windows session
o You chose either the Close, Exit, or End Session command, and Windows is
  asking you to confirm that you want to end the session.
  Choose the OK button to end the session. Choose the Cancel button to
  cancel the Close, Exit, or End Session command and continue working with
  Windows.

Not Enough Memory to Run

Since standard DOS applications vary considerably from one to the next,
there may be various circumstances under which Windows will display a
message stating that there is not enough memory to run an application. This
section describes several possible situations, and gives corrective actions
you can take to make your standard application run or run better with
Windows.

Not enough memory to run filename
o Windows tried to run a standard application that requires more memory
  than is currently available.
  Close one or more applications, then try to run the application again.

o The Memory Required option in the application's PIF file is set too low.
  The application fails in its attempt to load and execute.
  Check the amount of memory used by the application and be sure the Memory
  Required option is set for at least the
  required amount.

o The Memory Required option in the application's PIF file is set too high.
  Windows attempts to allocate that amount of memory from its available
  system memory; if the amount is more than is available, the application
  will not load.
  Check the amount of memory used by the application and be sure the Memory
  Required option is not set excessively higher than the required amount.

o The swapsize setting in the [pif] section of the WIN.INI file is set too
  low. Swapsize determines how much memory is set aside to run full-screen
  standard applications. Swapsize must be set high enough to allow for the
  program size, plus space for screen exchange, screen switching, any
  temporary files, and a 2K overhead for saving information about the
  application's current state.
  Determine the amount of space in kilobytes that you think the application
  will need, based on the above requirements. Edit the WIN.INI file to set
  swapsize equal to this amount.
  You can also set swapsize=0 (default setting) and run the largest full-
  screen standard application first. Windows assigns a partition size that
  will accommodate the first full-screen standard application.

o The Memory Desired option in the application's PIF file is set too low.
  Windows gives the application the necessary memory up to the desired
  amount. Memory Desired must be set high enough to allow for the program
  size as well as data space used by the program.
  Set the Memory Desired amount higher.

o You are attempting to run a standard application that requires more
  system memory than is available.
  To check available memory, select the File menu from the MS-DOS Executive
  window and choose the About MS-DOS Executive command. You may need to
  close some applications, then try running your application again.

o There may be other applications running that do not swap to the partition
  (the amount of memory set aside to run full-screen standard applications)
  because they directly modify memory, communications ports, or the
  keyboard. (Applications that can be swapped modify the screen.) The
  system may be running out of memory.
  Close some or all of these applications and try running your application
  again.

o You may have one or more memory-resident applications loaded in your
  system that are causing problems with the application you're attempting
  to run.
  Close the memory-resident applications before trying to run your
  application again.
