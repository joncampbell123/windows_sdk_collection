5 Using MS-DOS Executive



________________________________________

MS-DOS Executive runs automatically when you start Microsoft Windows. MS-
DOS Executive gives you access to DOS commands so that you can run
applications, copy and print files, and rename and delete files and
directories. You can also use MS-DOS Executive to create directories to
organize your files into convenient groups.

________________________________________
Running MS-DOS Executive

When you start Windows, the MS-DOS Executive window appears on your screen.

   _________________



















   _________________


The MS-DOS Executive window contains the following parts:


o The title bar displays the application name.


o The menu bar contains the names of the MS-DOS Executive menus.


o The drive icons represent the disk drives of your computer. The current
  drive is selected.


o The pathname shows what directory you are working in (the current
  directory). The pathname consists of the drive letter, followed by the
  volume name (if there is one) and the directory name. If the current
  directory is a subdirectory, you will see several directory names
  separated from each other by backslashes.


o The directory listing shows the directories and files in the current
  directory.


o
  The highlighted selection is the item (for example, a file or directory)
  that will be affected by the next command you choose.

If the entire directory listing can't fit in the window, MS-DOS Executive
displays a scroll bar. See Chapter 4, Techniques, for more information on
scrolling.

For detailed information on DOS directory structure and files, see the DOS
manuals provided with your computer.

___________________________________________________________________________
Making a Selection

When you work with Windows, you must select the item that the next command
or action will affect. The selected item is high-
lighted.


Selecting a File, Directory, or Drive Icon

You use the DIRECTION keys to select a file or directory (directories are
shown in bold) in the MS-DOS Executive window. You can also select a file
or directory by typing the first letter of the filename or directory name;
for example, if you type S, you select the first filename or directory name
beginning with S. Typing S again selects the second filename or directory
name beginning with S, and so on.


________________________________________
Selecting an item

The following list describes how to make selections:



To select   Press
___________________________________________________________________________

A filename  DIRECTION keys or initial letter
or

name

A drive     CONTROL+drive letter
icon


________________________________________

Here's how to select an item with the mouse:


1 Click the drive icon, filename, or directory name you want to select.


Note You can press the SPACEBAR to cancel a filename or directory name
selection. Pressing the SPACEBAR again reselects the filename or directory
name. If you have a mouse, you can press and hold down the SHIFT key, click
the selected filename, then release the SHIFT key to cancel a selection.


Extending a Selection

Whether you use the keyboard or the mouse, you can extend a selection to
include more than one item. You can select a block of files-files that are
next to each other-or you can select files that are scattered throughout
the directory listing.


________________________________________
Selecting a block of files

To select a block of files, follow these steps:


1 Use the DIRECTION keys to select the first file in the block.


2 Press and hold down the SHIFT key and press the DIRECTION keys to select
  the rest of the files in the block.


3 Release the SHIFT key when you are finished selecting.

To select a block of files with the mouse, do the following:


1 Press and hold down the SHIFT key and click all the files you want to
  select.


2 Release the SHIFT key when you have selected the desired files.


________________________________________
Selecting scattered files

To select files that are scattered throughout the directory listing, follow
these steps:


1 Press and hold down the CONTROL key and press the DIRECTION keys until a
  dotted box surrounds a file you want to select.


2 Release the CONTROL key.


3 Press the SPACEBAR to select the file.


4 Repeat steps 1, 2, and 3 to select all desired files.

1 Press and hold down the SHIFT key and click each file you want to select.


2 Release the SHIFT key.


___________________________________________________________________________
Starting an Application

You start applications from the MS-DOS Executive window. Starting an
application loads the application file into a window that appears in front
of the MS-DOS Executive window.

An application file usually has the name of the program and a .EXE or .COM
extension as its filename. For example, the file containing the Calendar
program has the filename CALENDAR.EXE.

You can start applications that are in the current directory or in any
other Windows directory.

Starting an Application in the Current Directory


________________________________________
Starting applications in the current directory

Follow this step to start an application in the current directory:


1 Select the application filename and press the ENTER key.

  The application window is displayed in front of the MS-DOS Executive
  window.


________________________________________

Here's how to start an application in the current directory with the mouse:


1 Double-click the application filename.



Starting an Application in Another Directory

You can start an application that is not in the current directory by using
the File menu's Run command. The Run command lets you supply additional
information, such as a pathname or a command-line argument.


________________________________________
Starting applications in other directories

To start an application in a different directory, follow these steps:


1 Select the File menu and choose the Run command. A dialog box appears.

     _________________




     _________________



2 Type the application's pathname, including the .EXE or .COM filename
  extension, in the text box. Include more information (such as an
  additional filename) if you need to.


3 Choose the OK button.


Starting an Application as an Icon

You can start an application as an icon rather than running it in
a window so that the application is ready for use but takes up minimal
space on your screen.


________________________________________
Running applications as icons

Follow this step to run an application as an icon:


1 Select the filename and press SHIFT+ENTER.

  The application icon appears in the icon area.


________________________________________

To run an application as an icon with the mouse, do the
following:


1 Press and hold down the SHIFT key and double-click the application
  filename. Release the SHIFT key.


________________________________________
Loading applications to run as icons
If you want to run an application as an icon but need to supply additional
information (such as a pathname or parameters), use the File menu's Load
command:


1 Select the File menu and choose the Load command.  A dialog box appears.

     _________________



     _________________



2 Type the application filename (or pathname if necessary), including the
  .EXE or .COM extension, in the text box. Include additional information
  (such as parameters) if you need to.


3 Choose the OK button.



Starting an Application by Opening a File

Many applications supply a particular filename extension to the files you
create with them. For example, the files you create with Notepad have a
.TXT extension. With applications of this type, you can start an
application by opening one of the files you created with it.


________________________________________
Running applications by opening files

To start an application by opening one of its files, do the
following:


1 Select the name of the file you want to open in the MS-DOS Executive
  window.


2 Press the ENTER key.



________________________________________
Running applications by opening files

If you have a mouse, you can open the file and start the application by
following this step:


1 Double-click the filename.


___________________________________________________________________________
Working with Files

A file can contain an application, graphics, or lines of text. Files in
Windows use DOS filenaming conventions. See your DOS manual for information
on naming files and directories. Since many applications automatically
supply a filename extension to files you create with them, you don't have
to supply one unless you want to. When deleting files, however, you must
supply the entire filename, including any extension.

Copying a File

You can copy a file under a new name or create a copy in a different
directory or on another disk by using the File menu's Copy command.


________________________________________
Duplicating files

To copy a file, do the following:


1 Select the file you want to copy.


2 Select the File menu and choose the Copy command. A
  dialog box appears. The selected filename appears in the
  Copy text box.

     _________________







     _________________



3 Type the new filename, or the pathname of the directory you want to copy
  the file to, in the To text box.

  If you have a two-drive system and are copying the file to another disk,
  put the destination disk in drive B. (After you finish copying, reinsert
  the system disk in drive B.)


4 Choose the OK button.


Copying a Group of Files

You can copy a group of files to a directory in one procedure.


________________________________________
Duplicating a group of files

To copy several files at once, follow these steps:


1 Select all the files you want to copy.

  For details on selecting groups of files, see the section called
  Extending a Selection earlier in this chapter.


2 Select the File menu and choose the Copy command. A dialog box appears.
  You will see the selected filenames in the Copy text box. If you select
  many files, there may not be room for all the filenames to appear in the
  Copy text box; however, all the files you've selected will still be
  copied.

3 In the To text box, type the pathname of the directory that you want the
  files copied to.

  If you have a two-drive system and are copying the files to another disk,
  put the destination disk in drive B. (After you finish copying, reinsert
  the system disk in drive B.)


4 Choose the OK button.


Note You cannot copy more than one file to a single file. You can copy
multiple files to a directory only.


Printing a File

Most applications have a command that prints files you create with that
application. You should use that command whenever possible. However, if you
want to print text files from the MS-DOS Executive window, you can use the
File menu's Print command.


________________________________________
Printing files

You can print files from the MS-DOS Executive window by following these
steps:


1 Select the file you want to print.


2 Select the File menu and choose the Print command. A dialog box appears
  with the name of the selected file in the text box.

     _________________




     _________________



3 Choose the OK button.

Using the Print command creates a print-spool file that is sent to the
Spooler program. See Chapter 8, Using Spooler, for more information on
Spooler.

Note See the hardware manual for your printer for instructions on
connecting the printer to your computer. For details on setting up, adding,
or removing a printer, see Chapter 7, Using Control Panel.


Changing a Filename

If you want to change the name of a file, you can do so by using the File
menu's Rename command.


________________________________________
Renaming files

Follow these steps to rename a file:

1 Select the file you want to rename.


2 Select the File menu and choose the Rename command. A dialog box appears
  with the name of the selected file in the Rename text box.

     _________________







     _________________



3 Type the new filename in the To text box.


4 Choose the OK button.



Getting Information About a File

If you want more information about a particular file or group of files, you
can use the File menu's Get Info command. When you choose Get Info, Windows
displays a dialog box showing the filename, size in bytes, and the date and
time the file was created or last changed.


________________________________________
Getting file information

Follow these steps to get information about a file:


1 Select the files you want information about.


2 Select the File menu and choose the Get Info command. The Get Info dialog
  box appears. This dialog box has a Control menu, a title bar, and if
  necessary, a scroll bar. If you have selected many files, you may need to
  scroll to see all the information in the dialog box.

     _________________





     _________________



3 When you are finished looking at the dialog box, select the Control menu
  in the dialog box and choose the Close command, or press the ESCAPE key.


Deleting a File

When a file is no longer useful, you can delete it to make room for other
files. When you delete a file, you remove it from the disk permanently. You
delete files with the File menu's Delete command.


________________________________________
Removing files

To remove a file, do the following:


1 Select the file you want to delete.


2 Select the File menu and choose the Delete command.
  A dialog box displays the name of the selected file.


3 Choose the OK button.

To delete more than one file at a time, select all the files you want to
delete, then follow steps 2 and 3 of the preceding procedure. If you select
many files, there may not be room in the dialog box's text box for all the
filenames to appear; however, all the files you've selected will still be
deleted.

Note Do not delete temporary files while you are running Windows
applications other than MS-DOS Executive; an application may be using the
temporary files. You can recognize a temporary file by its filename: it
usually begins with a tilde (~) and ends with a .TMP extension. See the
following section, Organizing Temporary Files, for more information.


Organizing Temporary Files

Some applications that run with Windows create temporary files. The
filename of a temporary file usually begins with a tilde character (~) and
ends with a .TMP extension. If you quit Windows without using the End
Session command, some temporary files may remain in your root (\)
directory. (Using the End Session command automatically deletes temporary
files at the end of each Windows session.) You should not delete temporary
files while you are running applications other than MS-DOS Executive
because the applications may be using them. After you close all
applications except MS-DOS Executive, you can safely delete these temporary
files.

You can have Windows put all temporary files your programs create into a
special directory; then you can quickly locate and, if you want, delete
them. If you don't specify an alternate directory, Windows places the .TMP
files in your root directory.


________________________________________
Putting temporary files in a directory

Follow these steps to specify where you want Windows to place the temporary
(.TMP) files:


1 Create a directory for your temporary files. See the following section,
  Working with Directories, for information on how to create a directory.


2 Add the following line to your DOS AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

  set TEMP=pathname


For example, if you had created the directory TEMPDIR on drive C, you would
add the following line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

   _________________
   _________________

Be sure to create the directory. If you specify a directory that doesn't
exist, applications that create .TMP files will not run.

___________________________________________________________________________
Working with Directories

You can use directories to organize your files into groups. You
can also create subdirectories within a directory.

The name of the current directory (the one you are working in) is always
shown in the pathname at the top of the MS-DOS Executive window. A pathname
contains the drive letter, the volume name (if there is one), and a
sequence of directory names with backslashes separating the names.

In the directory listing, directories are listed first. These are
subdirectories of the current directory. Directory names appear in bold
letters when the listing is in short form, as shown in the following
example.

   _________________
















   _________________


Creating a Directory


________________________________________
Making directories

You must create a directory before you can put files in it:


1 Select the Special menu and choose the Create Directory command. A dialog
  box appears.


2 Type the new directory name in the text box.


3 Choose the OK button.

Once you create a directory, you can use the File menu's Copy command to
copy files into it. See the section called Copying a File earlier in this
chapter for details. You also can use an application to create new files
for the directory.

Changing the Directory-Listing Display

When you start Windows, the MS-DOS Executive directory listing is displayed
in alphabetical order with directory names listed first. However, you may
want to see the directory listing displayed in a different way. You may
want to see the files listed in order of their size, or by the date they
were created or changed. Or you may want to see only files that have the
same extension.

You can change the order in which files are listed by using commands from
the View menu.

Using the View Menu


________________________________________

The commands in the View menu are divided into three groups. One command in
each of the three groups has a checkmark beside it, indicating that the
command is in effect.

You can choose a command from each group in the View menu to list your
files in different ways. When you choose a command from the View menu, it
affects only the directory you are displaying at that time. All commands
except Partial take effect as soon as you choose them. No matter which
command you choose, directories will always be listed first.

You choose from two commands in the first group:


o The Short command displays the listing in multiple columns by filename
  only.


o The Long command displays a one-column list containing each file's name,
  extension, and size in bytes, and the date and time it was created or
  last changed. Directory names are followed by |DIR.

You choose from three commands in the second group:


o The All command lists all files in the directory.


o The Partial command lets you specify a subset of the directory to
  display. A description of the Partial command follows this list of View
  menu commands.


o The Programs command displays filenames with .EXE, .COM, or .BAT
  extensions only.

You choose from four commands in the third group:


o The By Name command displays the listing alphabetically by filename.


o The By Date command displays the listing by the date and time each file
  was created or last changed, beginning with the most recent date and
  time.


o
  The By Size command lists files according to their size in bytes, sorting
  them from largest to smallest.


o The By Kind command lists files alphabetically by filename extension.


Displaying Part of a Directory


________________________________________
Using the Partial command

You may not always want to see a listing of all the files in a directory,
preferring instead to see only a particular group of files. For example,
you may want to see only files with the .EXE extension. Use the Partial
command to specify the kind of files you want to display:


1 Select the View menu and choose the Partial command. A dialog box
  appears.

     _________________




     _________________



2 In the text box, type the filenames you want to see. Use wildcard
  characters to tell Windows which kind of file to display; for example,
  type *.EXE to display all filenames with the .EXE extension.

  Wildcard characters represent other characters in a filename. See your
  DOS manual for details on using wildcard characters to specify filenames
  or directory names.


3 Choose the OK button.


Changing Directories

You change directories when you want to see what is in another directory or
when you want to work with the files in another directory. You can move
from one directory to another with the Special menu's Change Directory
command.


________________________________________
Moving to another directory

Follow these steps to move to another directory:


1 Select the Special menu and choose the Change Directory command. A dialog
  box appears. The text box contains the name of the directory you are
  working in.

     _________________



     _________________


2 Type the directory you want to go to, including a pathname if necessary.


3 Choose the OK button.


________________________________________
Directory-changing shortcuts

Here's how to quickly change to a subdirectory of your current directory:


1 Select the name of the directory you want to move to.

     _________________






     _________________



2 Press the ENTER key.

  The MS-DOS Executive window now lists the selected directory's contents.


   _________________







   _________________

Here's another useful shortcut for changing directories:


1 No matter where you are or what you have selected in the MS-DOS Executive
  window, you can go to the next higher directory by pressing the BACKSPACE
  key.



________________________________________
Changing directories

If you're using the mouse, you can do the following to change to a
subdirectory of your current directory:


1 Double-click the name of the directory you want to move to.

You can quickly change to a higher directory with the mouse by following
these steps:


1 In the pathname at the top of the MS-DOS Executive window, click the name
  of the directory you want to move to. A dialog box appears. The pathname
  to the left of the place you clicked appears in the text box (you can
  type a different directory pathname if you want).

     _________________

















     _________________



2 Click the OK button.


________________________________________
Shortcut

You can double-click part of the pathname at the top of the MS-DOS
Executive window to go to that directory without seeing a dialog box.

Displaying Two Directories Simultaneously


________________________________________
Displaying several directories at once

To display two different directories at the same time, run a second MS-DOS
Executive window and select a different direc-
tory or disk icon in each window:


1 Select MSDOS.EXE (on a two-drive system, MS-DOS.EXE is located on the
  Windows system disk) and press the ENTER key to run MS-DOS Executive as
  another window.


2 In the new MS-DOS Executive window, display the directory that you want
  to see by using one of the previously described procedures.

Follow this step to display the contents of another disk:


1 Press and hold down the CONTROL key, press the drive letter, then release
  the CONTROL key to choose a drive icon; this displays the directory
  listing for the disk in that drive.


________________________________________

If you're using the mouse, you can display the contents of another disk by
following this step:


1 Click the desired drive icon.

Each copy of the MS-DOS Executive window acts independently of the other,
so you can display and work with different directories in each window.


________________________________________
Exiting from an MS-DOS Executive copy

To exit from a copy of MS-DOS Executive without ending your Windows
session, follow this step:


1 Select the File menu and choose the Exit command.


Printing a Directory Listing


________________________________________
Printing directory listings

You can print a subdirectory listing by following these steps:


1 Select the directory name from the current directory listing.


2 Select the File menu and choose the Print command. A dialog box appears.
  The text box contains the selected directory name.


3 Choose the OK button.

To print the current directory listing, follow these steps:


1 Cancel the selection of any files or directories.

  To cancel a selection, press the SPACEBAR. To cancel a selection with the
  mouse, press and hold down the SHIFT key, click the selected filename,
  then release the SHIFT key.


2 Select the File menu and choose the Print command. A dialog box appears.
  The text box contains the current directory name.


3 Choose the OK button.


Deleting a Directory

Before you can delete a directory, you must first delete all files in the
directory. Windows will not delete a directory that contains files. This
feature protects you from losing files should you unintentionally try to
delete a directory.


________________________________________
Removing directories

To delete a directory, do the following:


1
  Select all the files in the directory that is to be deleted.


2 Select the File menu and choose the Delete command. A dialog box appears
  with as many of the selected filenames in the text box as will fit.


3 Choose the OK button.


4 If the directory you want to delete is your current directory, move to
  the next higher directory. You can't delete your current directory.


5 Select the name of the directory you want to delete.


6 Select the File menu and choose the Delete command. A dialog box appears
  with the selected directory name in the text box.


7 Choose the OK button.


___________________________________________________________________________
Working with Disks

You can use MS-DOS Executive to format disks, make system disks, and run
certain DOS programs.

Before you can use a new disk, you must prepare the disk by formatting it.
If you format a used disk, any information already on the disk will be
erased. Once you have formatted a disk, you can use it to store data or to
make a system disk. A system disk contains the files necessary for starting
DOS. You cannot format hard disks with MS-DOS Executive.


________________________________________
Formatting a disk

Here's how to format a disk:


1 Insert the new disk in the appropriate disk drive.


2 Select the Special menu and choose the Format Data Disk command. A dialog
  box appears.

     _________________





     _________________



3 Select the option button for the drive that contains the new disk.


4 Choose the OK button.

The disk is now ready to store data.


________________________________________
Making a system disk

To make a system disk, follow these steps:


1 Format a disk using the Format Data Disk command as described in the
  previous procedure.


2 Select the Special menu and choose the Make System Disk command. A dialog
  box appears.


3 Select the option button for the drive that contains the new disk.


4 Choose the OK button. (If COMMAND.COM is not in your Windows directory or
  on your Windows system disk, a dialog box appears requesting that you
  insert your DOS system disk.)


Naming a Disk


________________________________________
Setting a volume name

To identify a disk by its contents, you can give it a volume name by using
the Special menu's Set Volume Name command:


1 Select the drive icon for the drive that contains the disk you want to
  name.


2 Select the Special menu and choose the Set Volume Name command. A dialog
  box appears.


3 Type a name in the text box.


4 Choose the OK button.

The volume name for the disk now appears after the drive letter in the
pathname.



Running DOS Utility Programs

Some DOS utility programs, such as FIND or DISKCOPY, can be run in a window
if the programs are in directories that are accessible to Windows. See
Chapter 9, Using Standard Applications, for further information.


________________________________________
Running COMMAND.COM

You can also carry out DOS commands while using Windows by running
COMMAND.COM:


1
  Insert a disk containing COMMAND.COM. (This file is on your DOS disk.)


2 Display the directories for that disk.


3 Run COMMAND.COM from the MS-DOS Executive window.


4 Type the command you want to run in the COMMAND.COM window (include any
  command-line arguments) and press the ENTER key.


5 Type exit to leave the COMMAND.COM window when you are finished. Then
  select the Control menu and choose the Close command.


Note It is recommended that you run DOS utility programs from MS-DOS
Executive rather than from COMMAND.COM.

It is also recommended that you not use the DOS program CHKDSK in Windows.
If you do run it from Windows, do not use the /F parameter. CHKDSK was not
designed to run with Windows, and using the /F parameter will close any
files your Windows applications are using (such as temporary files).
