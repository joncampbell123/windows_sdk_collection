                    INFORMATION REGARDING OLIVETTI PRINTERS
================================================================================

     You have selected one of the following printers:

             Olivetti DM 100/1         Olivetti DM 290/292
             Olivetti DM 100/2         Olivetti DM 580
             Olivetti DM 100/4         Olivetti DM 590

             Olivetti DM 286/296       Olivetti DM 600

     Your printer has been installed; however, it has not yet been
     configured properly.  To properly configure your printer, use
     the Control  Panel.   For information on how to do this,  see
     "Configuring Your System" in Chapter 7, "Using Control Panel",
     of the Microsoft Windows User's Guide. Be sure to properly set
     up your communications port.

     If you are installing an Olivetti DM100 printer, you need to
     know which kind of DM100 you have.  The following table will help:

     DM100/1 or DM100/1a        The console dialog does not tell
                                you which emulation you have
                                (it is an IBM Graphics emulation).

     DM100/2 or DM100/2a or     The console dialog gives you the
     DM100/4 or DM100/4a        choice of three emulations:
                                IBM Graphics, IBM Proprinter,
                                or Epson FX.  The /2 and /2a
                                are serial (RS232) printers;
                                the /4 and /4a are parallel
                                (Centronics).
