                             INSTALLING REMM.SYS
========================================================================

0.  INTRODUCTION

REMM.SYS is the expanded memory manager for the AST RAMpage AT and the
RAMpage 286.  This REMM.SYS is not for use with the PS/2 version of the
AST RAMpage board.  The REMM.SYS file included with Windows 2.10 is
version 4.10.

Before installing REMM.SYS, you must install the AST RAMpage board
in your computer.  When doing this you should consider altering your
memory configuration in the following two ways:

     o If you have an IBM AT or a compatible 80286 machine, you
       should configure your AST RAMpage to have 128Kb of extended
       memory.  To do this, change the SW1 switch settings as follows:

              SW1-1 = ON,  SW1-2 = ON, 
              SW1-3 = OFF, SW1-4 = OFF
       
     o If it is possible to disable some of the memory on your
       computer's motherboard, you should do so.  You should
       disable all motherboard memory beyond 256Kb (i.e., leave
       256Kb enabled).  Consult your AST RAMpage documentation
       for details on doing this.

       To disable memory on the IBM PC AT's motherboard, move the
       J18 jumper from the first two pins, to the second two pins.
       Once you have done this, change the SW2 switch settings as
       follows:

              SW2-1 = ON, SW2-2 = ON,  SW2-3 = ON, SW2-4 = ON,
              SW2-5 = ON, SW2-6 = OFF, SW2-7 = ON, SW2-8 = OFF


Once you have installed the RAMpage hardware, you must install
the REMM.SYS memory manager by either running the MEMSET program
(see the booklet, "Microsoft Windows:  Questions and Answers," for
details), or by following the steps outlined below.

1.  INSTALLATION

To install the memory manager for the AST RAMpage, insert the
Utilities 2 Disk in drive A: and copy the file, REMM.SYS, to your
Root (i.e., C:\ ) directory using the following DOS command:

COPY A:REMM.SYS C:\

Next, make a backup of your CONFIG.SYS file.  You can do this with the
following DOS command:

COPY C:\CONFIG.SYS C:\CONFIG.SAF

Next, add the following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

DEVICE=C:\REMM.SYS

To determine where to place this line in your CONFIG.SYS we suggest
the following order:

     a.  drivers for hard disk partitioning utilities or exotic disks
         such as CD-ROM's, WORM optical disks, or high performance hard
         disk controllers

     b.  ANSI.SYS

     c.  drivers for mice, light pens, digitizing pads, or other
         pointing devices

     d.  drivers for graphics cards such as EGA.SYS (supplied in the
         Windows package -- see README.TXT on the Windows Write Disk)

     e.  drivers for image scanners

     f.  DEVICE=C:\REMM.SYS

The device line for REMM.SYS should be moved as near to the end of the
CONFIG.SYS file as possible.  The only lines that should follow it are
the entries for RAMDRIVE.SYS or SMARTDRV.SYS.

This 4.10 version of REMM.SYS is auto-configuring:  REMM.SYS will exclude
upper memory ranges used by devices other than the Rampage card, thus
avoiding memory conflicts.

Previous versions of REMM.SYS required the use of a /X parameter in order
to exclude the memory used by your display adapter.  If you have a DEVICE
line for REMM.SYS already, and it looks like the following (disregarding
capitalization):

DEVICE=REMM.SYS /X=AOOO-BFFF
DEVICE=REMM.SYS /X=B000-BFFF
DEVICE=REMM.SYS /X=B800-BFFF

then you may now remove the /X parameter so that it will simply read:

DEVICE=REMM.SYS

However, if there are other /X= entries in the original REMM.SYS entry,
double check to find out their purpose.  These entries may correspond to
upper memory addresses which are excluded from EMS mapping so that other
cards such as scanners, network cards, or special hard disk controllers
may use these ranges instead.


2.  ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

While REMM.SYS will avoid assigning upper memory ranges to expanded
memory during the loading of CONFIG.SYS, it will not be aware of other
"silent" devices that use memory in the ranges above 640Kb unless those
ranges are specifically excluded in the REMM.SYS line with the /X=
entry.  Most of these devices are network cards whose software does not
make use of these upper memory regions until they are activated later in
AUTOEXEC.BAT or via the batch file used to start the network software
(thus the term "silent" device).

The user is encouraged to check with his/her dealer or hardware support
technician to determine what addresses these cards may use.  Further it
is advisable to determine if the upper memory address range used by the
device is moved out as far as possible in upper memory to allow the
Windows/Excel memory managers as large a contiguous range of memory
addresses as possible.

Each of these "silent" devices which uses upper memory addresses will
require a /X= parameter in the command line for REMM.SYS.


3.  OPTIONAL PARAMETERS FOR REMM.SYS

If the user wishes to view detailed configuration information during
startup, the parameter /N may be added to the REMM.SYS command line:

DEVICE=REMM.SYS /N

This parameter may be used in conjunction with the /X= parameter.  For
example:

DEVICE=REMM.SYS /X=COOO-CFFF /N

will exclude the upper memory in the range C000-CFFF for use with
a device other than the AST RAMpage, and detailed configuration
information will be displayed.

Technical Support at (714) 863-1333.
