                              USING PS2EMM.SYS
===============================================================================

     The expanded memory manager for the IBM PS/2 80286 Memory Expansion
     Option is named PS2EMM.SYS.  This device driver conforms to the LIM
     4.0 Expanded Memory Specification (EMS).  Prior to installing this
     driver, please consult IBM's instructions for installing IBM PS/2
     80286 Memory Expansion Option boards.


     *NOTE: This driver does NOT work with the "IBM 80286 Expanded Memory
            Adapter /A", also known as the XMA board.  If you wish to use the
            XMA board with WINDOWS 2.10, you will need to have a LIM 4.0
            compatible Expanded Memory Manager (EMM), which is not supplied
            with WINDOWS 2.10.

===============================================================================
USING THE IBM PS/2 80286 EXPANSION MEMORY OPTION BOARD WITH WINDOWS
===============================================================================

     To use your IBM PS/2 Expansion Memory Option with WINDOWS 2.10, you
     must first install the expanded memory manager called PS2EMM.SYS.
     Once installed correctly, WINDOWS can utilize memory beyond the 640Kb
     memory barrier, and applications such as EXCEL will have more memory
     in which to store data.  PS2EMM.SYS is installed by entering the
     following line of text into your CONFIG.SYS file, and then restarting
     your computer:

     DEVICE=[drive:][path]PS2EMM.SYS [/p=xxxx] [/x=mmmm-nnnn] [/e]

     The parameters in brackets ([]) are optional, but may be important
     in correctly installing PS2EMM.SYS.

          /p=xxxx        (Page Frame Address Location)

               This parameter allows you to specify directly where the EMM
               page frame should be located in memory.  This 4 digit number
               (hexadecimal) represents the segment address where four 16Kb
               pages (also called banks) can reside.  The page frame can be
               located anywhere between segments A000 and E000.

               Once the segment address is specified, it will occupy the next
               64Kb of contiguous memory.  For example, "/p=C200" will locate
               the page frame between C200-D1FF.  The page frame address must
               be an even multiple of 512 Bytes (C000, C200, C400 ...).

          /x=mmmm-nnnn   (Memory Exclusion Range)

               This parameter allows you to specify a range of memory which
               will not be used for mapping expanded memory pages.  This is
               most likely to be used if other Expansion Option Board(s) are
               installed.  If other devices utilize memory between A000 and
               E000, then there is a possibility of conflict with the EMM and
               that device.

               For Example, the IBM Token-Ring Network Adapter utilizes memory
               between A000-E000 for its RAM/ROM usage.  If these addresses are
               not excluded, then there could be some contention between the
               EMM and the Token-Ring.  See the AUTOMATIC DETECTION section
               for further details.

          /e   (Small Frame EMM Option)

               This switch specifies that SMALL FRAME EMM is to be used.
               The default is LARGE FRAME EMM.

               By specifying this switch, you are in effect leaving the
               motherboard memory ENABLED (memory below 640Kb).  When enabled,
               that memory below 640Kb will not be made mappable for the EMM.
               This will conserve conventional memory used by WINDOWS under
               certain circumstances.

               By excluding this switch you are telling the driver to DISABLE
               the motherboard memory and make that memory mappable.  This
               maximizes the amount of memory available for mapping.

               The criteria you should use in determining whether to use the
               switch or not depends on the amount of memory installed in
               your machine.  If you have 3MB of memory or above, then LARGE
               FRAME EMM is best; if you have less than 3MB installed, then
               SMALL FRAME EMM is best.



     *NOTE: If you use Microsoft Excel, you must add the following line below
            the [Microsoft Excel] header in the WIN.INI file.  For information
            on modifying your WIN.INI file, see Appendix A, "Customizing Your
            WIN.INI File," in the Microsoft WINDOWS User's Guide.

               [Microsoft Excel]
                    ExtendedMemory=0

            Only add this line if you use the /e parameter on the PS2EMM.SYS
            line in your config.sys file.


           Examples:

               1.  device=c:\PS2EMM.SYS /p=C000
                   * This will force the page frame to be loaded at the C000
                     segment, thus occupying the ranges C000-CFFF.

               2.  device=c:\PS2EMM.SYS /x=D200-D7FF
                   * This will exclude the segments between D200 and D7FF from
                     being mapped by the expanded memory manager.  This option
                     is most likely to be used to exclude memory being used
                     by other cards (such as network cards) which need a
                     particular range of memory for their own use.  The
                     memory that these cards use must not be mappable.

               3.  device=c:\PS2EMM.SYS /p=D000 /x=C200-CBFF
                   * This specifies the pageframe to be loaded at the address
                     D000 and to occupy the next 64Kb (D000-DFFF).  The range
                     C200-CBFF will not be used for mapping by the EMM.

               4.  device=c:\PS2EMM.SYS /e
                   * The EMM will be installed using the small frame manager.
                     This will load the pageframe at the first four 16Kb
                     contiguous pages of memory.  The mother board will be
                     left enabled and therefore, not be used for mapping.

               5.  device=c:\PS2EMM.SYS
                   * Pageframe is loaded at first available memory.  Large
                     frame EMS is used, therefore the mother board memory
                     is disabled and used for mapping.  No memory is excluded.

===============================================================================
AUTOMATIC DETECTION
===============================================================================

     The PS2EMM.SYS driver detects the following boards which utilize memory
     between A000-E000:

          o  IBM Token-Ring Network Adapter.
          o  IBM 3270 Emulation Adapter.
          o  Ungermann-Bass Network Adapter.

     To save you the trouble of determing what memory addresses to
     exclude, or where to load the page frame, PS2EMM.SYS searches
     between A000 and E000 to find addresses used by these adapters.
     It then excludes these addresses, making them non-mappable.  Once
     it finds a contiguous block of memory, it loads the page frame
     segment.


     Example:  You have the IBM Token-Ring Adapter, using address range
               C800-CFFF, installed in your machine, and the following
               line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

               DEVICE=C:\PS2EMM.SYS

               * When PS2EMM.SYS installs, it searches for non-mappable
                 segments which are occupied by other devices.  In this
                 case C800-CFFF.  The page frame would then be loaded
                 at D000 to avoid conflict with the other device.  The
                 addresses C800-CFFF would be excluded.  This is the
                 same as having typed the following in the CONFIG.SYS

                 DEVICE=C:\PS2EMM.SYS /p=D000 /x=C800-CFFF



     *NOTE: Take care in setting up the Expansion Option Board's
            memory ranges.  The board can occupy memory ranges which
            would inhibit the PS2EMM.SYS driver from finding four
            contiguous 16Kb pages for the page frame.  If you are not
            getting a full 64Kb page-frame, then follow IBM's instructions
            on installing/configuring Memory Expansion Option Boards.  To
            solve these problems, you may need to relocate the address
            ranges of your board to accomodate the page frame.

ERROR MESSAGES
===============================================================================


    Message:  The system memory was disabled by someone before us.
              Driver will not be installed.

Explanation:  Motherboard memory was disabled before an attempt was made
              to load PS2EMM.SYS.

     Result:  Since the driver must use the motherboard memory, installation
              of PS2EMM.SYS was abandoned.

   Solution:  Determine what disabled the motherboard memory.  Re-enable
              the motherboard memory before attempting to load PS2EMM.SYS.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Message:  Not enough pages of expanded memory available for this driver.

Explanation:  PS2EMM.SYS needs at least 41 pages (656K) if /E option is not
              specified.  The expanded memory board has less than this.

     Result:  PS2EMM.SYS was not loaded.

   Solution:  Try installing with the /E option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Message:  There is not enough RAM to initialize this driver.

Explanation:  Too little memory was available to load PS2EMM.SYS into the
              lower 640Kb of RAM.

     Result:  PS2EMM.SYS was not installed.

   Solution:  Free some memory in the lower 640Kb.  Check your CONFIG.SYS
              file for unnecessary device drivers.  Reduce the number of
              buffers specified by the "buffers=" command line in CONFIG.SYS.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Message:  ERROR: Bad command line.

Explanation:  Parameters specified for PS2EMM.SYS in the CONFIG.SYS command
              line are incorrect.

     Result:  PS2EMM.SYS was not installed.

   Solution:  Change the parameters to conform to the usage described above.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Message:  No memory boards found.  Driver will not be installed.

Explanation:  No IBM Personal System/2 Expanded Memory Option board is
              installed, or the board is incorrectly installed.
              
     Result:  PS2EMM.SYS was not installed.

   Solution:  Check the installation of your IBM Personal System/2
              Expanded Memory Option board(s).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Message:  Not enough memory is mappable.  Driver will not be installed.

Explanation:  PS2EMM.SYS found no mappable memory banks below 1 Megabyte
              with which it can access your expanded memory.

     Result:  PS2EMM.SYS was not installed.

   Solution:  Free some memory below 1 Megabyte by disabling some
              hardware or software devices.  Check your CONFIG.SYS
              file for unnecessary device drivers.  Remove other
              hardware boards which may be taking up memory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Message:  WARNING: Your page frame is smaller than 64K.
              Some programs that require expanded memory may not be usable.

Explanation:  The page frame found above 640K is less than 4 banks long.

     Result:  Programs written for LIM 3.2 assumed a page frame 4 banks
              long and hence will not run in this configuration.  Since
              the LIM 4.0 specification does not require a 4 bank long
              page frame the driver was still installed.

   Solution:  Free enough memory between 640K and 1 Megabyte to have a
              page frame of 4 banks.  Do this by disabling some hardware
              or software devices.  Check your CONFIG.SYS file for
              unnecessary device drivers.  Remove other hardware boards
              which may be taking up memory.
