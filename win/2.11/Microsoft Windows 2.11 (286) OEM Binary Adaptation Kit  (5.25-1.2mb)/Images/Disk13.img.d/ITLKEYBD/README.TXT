        This directory contains the international language keyboards which
build the keyboard drivers supplied with Windows/286 Version 2.10.  You
should note that the U.S./Canadian English and Standard German keyboards
in addition to .LIB and common files necesary to build the keyboard drivers 
are located on another disk in the Device Driver/OEM Kit disk set.  
You should combine the directories from that disk with this one in order 
to create a full keyboard driver source library.

        If you are building the Latin American Spanish driver, please read 
the README.TXT file in that directory.


Thanks
