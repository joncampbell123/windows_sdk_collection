        There are two documents included in this directory for use by
programmers wishing to understand the HIMEM functionality.  The first
(HIMEM.WRI) is a document which will soon appear in an issue of the Microsoft 
Systems Journal This document is a .WRI file and can be loaded into 
Microsoft WRITE (included in the retail Windows 2.1 kits).

The second (PROGREF.TXT) describes the programmer's interface for writing 
to the HIMEM device driver.  It is a standard ASCII text file.
