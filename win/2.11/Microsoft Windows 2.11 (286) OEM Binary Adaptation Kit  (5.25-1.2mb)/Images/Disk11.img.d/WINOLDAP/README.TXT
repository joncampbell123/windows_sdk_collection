        IMPORTANT!!!! You must use a custom version of LINK4.EXE when
building the WINOLDAP.GRB module.  This is found on the custom C compiler
tools diskette for the OEM kit.  You must use this LINK4.EXE ONLY for
the creation of WINOLDAP.MOD.  It should not be used for any other purpose!
The version number printed out by the custom version of LINK4.EXE is
Version 5.00.12.  The version number printed out by the "general purpose"
LINK4.EXE is Version 5.01.17.
