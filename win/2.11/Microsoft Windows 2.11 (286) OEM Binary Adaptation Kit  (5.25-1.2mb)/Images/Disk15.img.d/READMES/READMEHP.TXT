You have selected one of the following printers:

   HP LaserJet              Epson GQ-3500             Tegra Genisis
   HP LaserJet Plus         Kyocera F-1010 Laser      Wang LDP8
   HP LaserJet 500+         NEC SilentWriter LC860    Olivetti PG 208 M2
   HP LaserJet Series II    Okidata LaserLine 6       Olivetti LP 5000
   HP LaserJet 2000         QuadLaser I               Toshiba PageLaser 12
   Apricot Laser            Tandy LP-1000             

These printers are known as "PCL" printers.  Your PCL printer has
been installed; however, it has not yet been configured properly.  To
properly configure your PCL printer, use the Control Panel.  For more
information on how to do this, see "Configuring Your System" in
Chapter 7, "Using Control Panel", of the Microsoft Windows User's
Guide.  Be sure to select the proper font cartridge for your printer;
if you do not, your font options may be limited by some applications.
Also, be sure to properly set up your communications port.



Using Soft Fonts With Hewlett Packard Laser Printers:

The following describes how to use soft fonts with Hewlett
Packard Laser Printers.  To use soft fonts, your printer must
have the proper hardware.  The HP LaserJet will not support soft
fonts.  The HP LaserJet+, HP LaserJet II, and HP LaserJet 2000
all support soft fonts.  If you have a printer which emulates an
HP Laser Printer and wish to use soft fonts, you should contact
your printer dealer or manufacturer to determine if your printer
supports soft fonts.  

Soft fonts that you copy onto your computer and download
to your printer.  Many soft font installation programs, such as
PCLPAK from Hewlett-Packard and Fontware from Bitstream, include
installation programs of their own.  If you plan to use one of these
installation programs, make sure that you install the font as Windows
compatible fonts.  In general, three types of files can be included
in a soft font package:

  - Printer Font File

    Printer fonts are what actually get installed on your printer.

  - Printer Font Metrics File (PFM)

    Printer font metrics are an optional file that are either
    included by the soft font vendor or generated by Soft Font
    installer that is part of the Windows PCL printer driver.

  - Screen Font File

    These are screen equivalents of your printer fonts.  They should
    be installed using the "Add fonts..." command in the Windows
    Control Panel.

You can download fonts to your printer two ways; as "Permanent" fonts
or as "Temporary" fonts.  Permanent fonts are copied to your printer's
memory before you print.  Consult your soft font manual for instructions
on downloading "Permanent" fonts.  These fonts are kept in your printer's
memory until you turn off the printer.  "Permanent" fonts print faster,
but take up much more of your printer's memory than "Temporary" fonts.
"Temporary" fonts are automatically downloaded to your printer as you
print.  After your printing has finished, they are removed from your
printer's memory.  This conserves on your printer's memory, but means
that fonts will be downloaded every time you print.

You can use the Soft Font Installer to add temporary or permanent fonts, 
move fonts between printer ports, and remove fonts from your printer.
To use the Soft Font Installer that is part of your PCL printer driver,
bring up the printer specific dialog by selecting the "Printer..."
command in the Windows Control Panel and choosing the PCL / HP LaserJet
selection.  Clicking the "Fonts" button in the printer specific dialog will
bring up the Soft Font Installer.

If you want to install soft fonts on your system, insert the soft fonts
disk in drive a:, bring up the printer specific dialog, click on the
Fonts button, and then click on the "Add Fonts ..." button.  The installer
copies the printer fonts and PFM files to your hard disk.  If there are
no PFM files, the installer will create them for you.

If you want to move or copy the soft fonts to another PCL printer on
another port, bring up the printer specific dialog, click the Fonts
button, and then click the Copy button after selecting the fonts you
want moved or copied.

If you want to remove the soft fonts, bring up the printer specific 
dialog, click the Fonts button, and then click the Remove button after 
selecting the fonts you want removed.


Steps for Installing Additional Font Cartridge Support:

1. To add new font cartridge support, you need to first obtain a 
.PCM file for your cartridge from your font cartridge vendor.

2. Run the Control Panel to set up the PCL / HP LaserJet printer.  
From the printer dialog box, select the "Fonts" button to bring up 
the Soft Font Installer.  Select "Add Fonts" and type in the drive/directory 
containing the font cartridge PCM file.

You should now see the title of your cartridge in the add fonts 
listbox.  There will be a "(c)" next to the name, indicating it is a 
font cartridge (PCM).  Select this as you would a soft font, and select 
"Add" (see instructions above for more on Soft Font Installation).  
Once the cartridge is installed, select "Exit". 

3. You should now be in the HPPCL main dialog box.  Scroll to the 
end of the "Cartridges" listbox.  Your font cartridge will be listed 
at the end.  Select your cartridge, and choose "OK".

You do not need to repeat the cartridge installation in step 2, unless 
you remove it through the soft font installer.
