MDDK MCICORE Test Case Descriptions
===================================

The following document lists each of the Test Cases in the mcicore.exe
Test Application.

Each Test Case will be identified by Test Case Number, a one-line
description (which appears in the Test Shell's list box in the
Select Tests Dialog), and a short outline of the code executed in the
test case.  

Each test case refers to a driver, element and a path to elements.
Each test case is invoked using the mciSendString command.
The driver and element are entered in the "Parameters!" dialog box.
The compound tests use the element extension also specified in the 
"Parameters!" dialog box along with the input path specified in the
input and output paths dialog box (see test shell description for 
more details).
