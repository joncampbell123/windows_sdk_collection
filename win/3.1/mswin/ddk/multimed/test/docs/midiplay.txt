DDK midiPlay Test Case Descriptions
===================================

This document lists the Test Cases in the midiPlay.exe MIDI Driver
Output Test Application.

The "Options" menu has a menuitem called "Play File..." which allows
other Standard MIDI Files to be played and also allows the included
files to be played without first selecting them with the "Test"
menuitem "Select Tests..."

Therefore, there are no real differences between the 32 test cases
other than the file which is played.

Most of these files' contents are described by the Test Case name. 
You will find that cases 13 through 22 and 24 through 32 are
musical enough to listen to the output on a MIDI synthesizer and
expect them to sound reasonable.  The other test cases (1 - 12 &
23) are more oriented towards testing transmission of specific
types of MIDI data, are are therefore not very 'listenable'
