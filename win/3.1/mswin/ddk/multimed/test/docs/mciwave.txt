MDDK MCIWAVE Test Case Descriptions
===================================

The following document lists each of the Test Cases in the mciwave.exe
Test Application.

Each Test Case will be identified by Test Case Number, a one-line
description (which appears in the Test Shell's list box in the

input and output paths dialog box (see test shell description for 
more details).
