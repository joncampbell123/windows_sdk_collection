RASTER TEST (BitBlt Test)

TEST
     This tests the correctness of the Ternary Raster Operations
     (ROP3s) when outputting to a page.  All selected brushes are
     tested exhaustively as Source and Destination bitmaps, and
     each permutation is tested with the 15 names ROP3 codes (as
     defined in the SDK Documentation).  The pattern brush is
     maintained as a constant BS_FDIAGONAL to reduce the amount
     of generated output.  Given the output and an understanding
     of ROP3 codes, the printer's BitBlt code can be verified.
 
ASSUMPTIONS
     Brushes are assumes to align on 8 pixel boundaries.

EXPECTED RESULTS
     For each permutation of brushes, you should expect 15 squares
     being output (One for each named ROP3).  The format is:

     RopName
     -------------
     |   |   |   |
     | S | D | P |
     |   |   |   |
     -------------
     |           |
     |Combination|
     |           |
     -------------

     Where:
       RopName     = Name of Ternary Raster Operation
       S           = Sample of Source Bitmap
       D           = Sample of Destination Bitmap
       P           = Sample of Pattern Brush (BS_FDIAGONAL)
       Combination = Result of BitBlt
