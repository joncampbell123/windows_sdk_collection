CURVES TEST (Ellipse)

TEST
     This tests the drawing of ellipse objects using the pens,
     brushes and background modes the printer driver is capable
     of implementing.  The basic strategy is as follows:

          a) Set the background mode (either OPAQUE or TRANSPARENT).
          b) Set the brush to one of the enumerated device brushes.
          c) Draw the ellipse for all the enumerated pens.

     This is done for all combinations of pens, brushes, and 
     backgrounds. The ellipses are 1 inch in diameter, spaced 1/4
     inch apart.  The rectangle is the same height as the ellipse,
     but only half the width.

ASSUMPTIONS
     To verify the different colors of pens and brushes, the ellipse
     is printed over a grayed rectangle.  This will show the effects
     of using a WHITE pen as well as a BLACK pen.  It will also show
     the different effects of using different background modes.

EXPECTED RESULTS
     If the background mode is OPAQUE, then you should expect to see
     the ellipse cover the rectangle with the selected brush.  If a
     NULL brush is selected, then you will see the rectangle.

     If the background mode is TRANSPARENT, then you should expect to
     see the grayed rectangle showing through the different hatched
     brushes.  If a solid brush is selected (ie BLACK or WHITE), then
     the rectangle will be overwritten by that color.
