TEXT TEST
This section tests the Text Capabilities of the printer driver. It
utilizes the features of the ExtTextOut function associated with GDI
and the printer driver. In testing the text capabilities of the
driver, the font objects which the driver supports are also tested.

TESTS
1) Text Clipping to a rectangle.
This tests the output of a string onto a clipping rectangle.

This section uses GDI's ExtTextOut function, as described in the
Windows SDK. Three parameters are varied--whether the text is
output as ETO_OPAQUE or ETO_CLIPPED, the portions of the test
string that lie within the specified clipping rectangle, and
the extra spacing introduced when printing.

The test consists of  outputting a test string at the nine
cardinal positions of a rectangle (see below), so different
portions of the text sample are excluded from the clipping
rectangle. If the rectangle is opaque, the text should not
be clipped to the rectangle. If the rectangle is clipped,
then no characters that lie entirely outside the clipping
should be printed. Characters that lie partially inside the
clipping rectangle may or may not be clipped, depending on
the clipping capabilities indicated in the GDIINFO structure.
