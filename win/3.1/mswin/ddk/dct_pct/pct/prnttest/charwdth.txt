CHARACTER WIDTHS/ANSI CONFORMITY TEST
This section tests the accuracy of the values returned from the
GetCharWidth function, as well as the ANSI conformity of the
character set of the specified font.  Both of these tests limit
themselves to the font's supported character set.

TESTS
1) Character Width.
For each character supported by the font, a test string is built.
The string consists the character repeated ten times, plus a right
bracket (]).  Based on the character width information, the test
string is then positioned so it is right justified.  Multiple columns
are used where font size and page size allow.  Since the positioning
is based solely on character width information, any misaligned
characters represent an error in the values returned from
GetCharWidth().

2) ANSI Conformity
For each supported character, the ANSI glyph of the same value
is printed to the right of the justification string.  Where possible,
a TrueType font (Arial) is used.  If Arial is unavailable, the
Windows stock ANSI_VAR_FONT is used instead.  This allows easy
visual verification of character mapping for non-ANSI fonts.
The numeric value of the glyph is also printed, to facilitate
error reporting if one or more characters are incorrectly mapped.
Note that Arial uses the enhanced ANSI specification, and that
characters for values 127-159 were not supported in Windows 3.0.
An updated table of the ANSI glyphs (including the enhanced
specification) can be found in the Windows 3.1 User's Guide.
The ANSI conformity portion of the test is not available if the
character width portion of the test will exceed the available
page width.
