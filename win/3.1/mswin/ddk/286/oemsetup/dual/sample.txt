Microsoft Windows 3.1 Device Development Kit
Sample Dual Version Driver Distribution Disk

--------------------------------------------

The \DUAL directory demonstrates what a display driver distribution
diskette would look like to support both Windows 3.0 and Windows 3.1.
Note that a driver distribution disk does not have a "\dual" directory.
The contents of the dual version distribution disk are as follows:

Directory or File	Description
-----------------	-----------
.			This is the main directory of the driver 
			distribution disk.  Only documentation files,
			such as README.TXT, should be included in this
			directory.

README.TXT		This file should instruct the user to
			run the Windows Setup program to install
			the correct display driver.  They should
			specify either \win30drv or \win31drv when
			Setup prompts for the driver disk.  See the
			sample README.TXT.

\win30drv		This directory contains 3.0 versions for
			OEMSETUP.INF and other driver, font, and
			logo files.

\win31drv		This directory contains 3.1 versions for
			OEMSETUP.INF and other driver, font, and
			logo files.

\shared			This directory contains files that can be
			used in either version of Windows 3.x.
			This includes some fonts, driver files, etc.
