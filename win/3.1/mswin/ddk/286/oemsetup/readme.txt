Sample Display Driver Distribution Disks
Copyright 1992 Microsoft Corporation
--------------------------------------------
This directory contains sample display driver distribution
disks, but without the actual files.  Sample OEMSETUP.INF
files are supplied in both examples, with in-line documentation.
You can use these OEMSETUP.INF files to create your own.

\DUAL:	This demonstrates how to build a dual Windows 3.0/3.1
	driver distribution diskette.  See SAMPLE.TXT in this
	directory for more information.  Note that dual version
	driver diskettes should not contain an actual \DUAL directory.

\WIN31:	This demonstrates how to build a Windows 3.1 only driver
	distribution diskette.  See the OEMSETUP.INF file for
	more information.  Note that Windows 3.1 driver distribution
	diskettes should not contain an actual \WIN31 directory.
