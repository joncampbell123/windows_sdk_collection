;   2-24-89     jimmat  Converted from a resource to a table in the
;			            _REALIZE code segement to speed up the
;			            aliasFace() routine.  Also, this cuts out a lot
;			            of code that used to load/lock/unlock the table.
;
;   1-07-91     dtk     Added entries for Univers in the helv table so helv
;                       will map Univers and not Univers Condensed in the 
;                       IIIsi.  Also added MS fonts and moved helv up in
;                       the list to reduce search time.
