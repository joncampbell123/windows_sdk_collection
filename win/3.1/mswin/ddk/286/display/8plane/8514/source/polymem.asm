;  Given a set of points, draws a set of polylines connecting adjoining points;
;  This routine handles output to EGA as well as to BITMAPS (small or huge)   ;
;								              ;
;  Breshenham's Run Length Slice algorithm is used to draw the lines. Though  ;
;  the algorithm is not derived here, the steps necessary in implementation   ;
;  are explained later.					                      ;
;							                      ;
;  The way the algorithm works can be summarised below:			      ;
;									      ;
;               . To draw any line we have to set on a set of  pixels which   ;
;                 fall on the line or are closest to it.In cases where a line ;
;                 passes exactly between two pixels, we resolve the tie by    ;
;                 setting on the lower pixel			              ;
;								              ;
;               . As a result of the above approximation, a line will actually;
;                 be drawn as a series of steps.			      ;
;								              ;
;               . At any particular pixel position, the next pixel to set on  ;
;                 depends on the direction of progress and the slope of the   ;
;                 line, but because of the discrete movements, it can be the  ;
;                 next pixel in one of the following 8 directions:            ;
;							                      ;
;		              . Positive X / Negative X			      ;
;                             . Positive Y / Negative Y		              ;
;                             . Along one of the 4 diagonals in 1st, 2nd, 3rd ;
;                               or 4th quadrants.		              ;
;							                      ;
;               . Depending upon the slope of the line we will actually have  ;
;                 a series of pixels set on in one of the 8 directions, then  ;
;                 a move of 1 pixel in a second direction (one of above 8)    ;
;                 followed by another run of pixels in the first direction    ;
;                 , a move 1 pixel in the second direction and so on ...      ;
;							                      ;
;		. A line thus will have an AXIAL direction, along which most  ;
;                 of the pixels are set on and a DIAGONAL (to the axial) dir  ;
;                 which separates one run of pixel on the AXIAL direction     ;
;                 from the other				              ;
;								              ;
;               . The AXIAL and DIAGONAL directions can be one of the above   ;
;                 8 directions, the exact directions can be calculated from   ;
;                 slope of the line and the direction of progress.            ;
;									      ;
;               . To facilitate the calculation of the run lengths along the  ;
;                 AXIAL direction, we can rotate the line till the AXIAL dir  ;
;                 becomes the POSITIVE X axis and the DIAGONAL direction beco-;
;                 -mes the diagonal in the first quadrant.                    ;
;						                              ;
;               . The steps to do the above rotation are:		      ;
;						                              ;
;		              . Translate to origin. Let the other end point  ;
;                               be at (Xf,Yf)				      ;
;	                      . Get the line into the first quadrant. So the  ;
;                               end point will now be (|Xf|,|Yf|)             ;
;                             . Get it below the slope=1 line. That is, inter-;
;                               -change the abscissa and ordinate of the end  ;
;                               point to ensure that the abscissa is >= the   ;
;                               ordinate. Let end point now be at (X,Y)       ;
;                             . If the line is above the slope=1/2 line, get  ;
;                               it below by making the end point to be (X,X-Y);
;               							      ;
;               . The line thus constructed will be in the same relative posi-;
;                 -tion wrt the +X axis and the 1st. quadrant diagonal, as the;
;                 original line was wrt it's AXIAL and DIAGONAL directions.   ;
;			                                                      ;
;               . If the pseudo line runs from (0,0) to (X,Y), we have to cal-;
;                 -culate the number of pixels to set on, on each of the hori-;
;                 -zontal scan lines at y=0,1,2,...,Y 			      ;
;                							      ;
;               . Consider scan line at y=i 0<i<Y.                            ;
;                 If the line intersects the scan line at y=i-1/2 at x, then  ;
;                 the first pixel to set on, on the ith scan line is at       ;
;                 floor(x)+1 and the last is at floor(x + s) where s is the   ;
;                 inverse slope.			                      ;
;							                      ;
;               . The run length on the ith scan line is thus:		      ;
;                             floor(x+s) - floor(x)		              ;
;								              ;
;               . The idea behind the algorithm is to calculate these run len-;
;                 -gths and does so by using the run length on the previous   ;
;                 line and an error term.			              ;
;					                                      ;
;               . We finally get a series of run lengths, H0 on i=0, scan line;
;                 HY on the last scan line, and Hi on the intermediate ones.  ;
;						                              ;
;		. The pseudo line was just used to calculate the run lengths. ;
;                 While drawing the line, we start at the original starting   ;
;                 point (not at origin) the first run of H0 is in the actual  ;
;                 AXIAL direction, a move of 1 pixel in the DIAGONAL dir,and  ;
;                 so on, till the last run of HY pixel on the AXIAL direction ;
;                 takes us to the actual end point of the line.               ;
;							                      ;
;									      ;
;  Certain manipulations are made with the end points to make the code simpler;
;  These are:							              ;
;									      ;
;               . All lines will be drawn towards positive X axis, to do this ;
;                 we will swap the initial and final coordinates if necessary ;
;                 This will elliminate three directions of movement which inv-;
;                 -olve the negative X axis, leaving us with 5 directions.    ;
;    						                              ;
;               . The code for drawing/moving along the diagonal or vertical  ;
;                 directions require the distance in bytes between one scan   ;
;                 line and the next. If we call the routine which draws in a  ;
;                 direction involving the positive Y axis, with the negative  ;
;                 of the scan line offset, it would actually draw in a the    ;
;                 corresponding direction involving negative Y                ;
;				                                              ;
;               . With the above two manipulations, we need to implement rout-;
;		  -ines to draw in 3 basic directions, Positive X, Positive Y ;
;                 and the diagonal in the first quadrant.		      ;
;							                      ;
;               . Routines to move 1 pixel in the DIAGONAL direction are made ;
;                 separate as we will not set on any pixel during these moves.;
;                 We will thus have 3 move routines too, as the DIAGONAL dire-;
;                 -ction of the line could agagin be one of the 5 basic ones. ;
;								              ;
;		. There are 4 sets of draw routines depending on the device & ;
;                 the type of the line. These are:			      ;
;		              . Solid Lines to EGA		              ;
;                             . Styled Lines to EGA                           ;

;                             . Styled Lines to BITMAPS (huge and small)      ;
;                 Routines are made separate as the organization of memory and;
;                 the method used to process the pixels are different.        ;
;				                                              ;
;	        . There are two sets of MOVE routines, one for EGA and the ot-;
;                 -her for BITMAPS.		                              ;
;					                                      ;
;	        . Styled lines are drawn in two passes, the second pass is to ;
;                 draw the gaps for OPAQUE background modes.                  ;

;									      ;
;  For lines which are originally below the X axis, the metric of rounding    ;

;  To take care of this the metric for the above flipped psudo-lines should   ;

;  cases by a minute amount to the left, so as to bias the ties infavour of   ;
;  required pixel but small enough so as to not affect the non-tie cases.     ;
;  The amount of shift can be shown to be (1/2Y) where the Y is the ordinate  ;

                       Programing the EGA REGISTERS:
	               -----------------------------

 12 of the 16 ROPs can be completed in one pass. Let us represent the existing
 pixel value of a piexl to be operated on by D and the value of the pen as P.
 The ROPs which invert D and then combines it with P (or inverted P) cannot be
 completed in one pass. 

	                   EGA ONE PASS ROPs
                           -----------------

 12 of the ROP codes actually combine D with P or !P or a constant 0 or 1.These
 can all be done in one pass. The combination function can be one of four:
                             AND,XOR,OR or SET
 one of the operands of these function is D which is the value already existing
 to get the other operand it is enough that we mask P with PenANDFlag and then
 XOR it with PenXORFlag. These two flags are chosen appropriately so that it   
 gives us one of the following four values:
              
                             P   ----  ie, PenANDFlag = 0fh, PenXORFlag = 00h
                            !P   ----                 = 0fh             = 0fh
                          0000   ----                 = 00h             = 00h
                          1111   ----                 = 00h             = 0fh

  Thus for one pass ROPs, the EGA is programmed as follows:

                      . SET BIT MASK REGISTER to enable required bit
                      . SET ENABLE SET/RESET REGISTER to enable all S/R bits
                      . SET S/R register to P combined with AND & XOR as above
                      . SET DATA ROTATE REGISTER to proper combine function

  Note that with the above setting, the CPU value in a write does not affect\
  the final pixel value (as the S/R register value combines with D)

                          EGA TWO PASS ROPs
                          -----------------

  4 of the ROPs actually operate as follows:

                      . some of the bits in the pixel value are set to either
                        0 or 1. In some cases these are the bits where the 
                        Pen color has a 0, and in other cases these bits in
                        the Pen color have a 1.
                      . For the remaining bits, the existing color is inverted

  Conviniently the two passes over the EGA that are required will do precisely
  the above steps one after the other. We now require to enable some of the
  planes depending on the color value and set the S/R register to 0 or 1, 
  depending upon the value that is to be set. In the second pass the remaining
  planes are enabled and the S/R register is set to 1 and combine function
  set to XOR (to invert the existing bit values in the enabled planes). Note
  in the first pass the combine function is always set to SET.

         First Pass:
                      . XOR P with PenXORFlag use this to write to the
                        ENABLE S/R REGISTER and SEQUENCER MAP MASK REGISTER
                        (the PenXORFlag is chosen appropriately to ensure that
                         the planes that are enabled now are the ones that
                         have to be set to 0 or 1)
                      . Set the S/R REGISTER to value of PenANDFlag , this will
                        be 0 or 1 depending on whether bits are to be set on
                        or off.
                      . DATA ROTATE REGISTER is set to DataROTFlag (which is 
                        always = SET in the first pass)
                      . The drawing routines enable required pixels

         Second Pass:
                      . P is XORed with PenXORFlag and the result is then 
                        Inverted to select the planes that were disabled in
                        the first pass.
                        The above value programs the SEQUENCER MAP MASK REG 
                      . DATA ROTATE REGISTER is set to XOR combine mode
                      . Note that the ENABLE S/R resgieter is not touched,
                        but it has the complement of the value in the SEQ
                        MAP MASK REGISTER and hence the S/R register actually
                        does not participate in the second pass, but the CPU
                        used to write will be 0ffh and hence with the XOR    
                        function this will invert the required bits.

        Note that in the second pass the ENABLE S/R register is not touched
        but the SEQUENCER MAP MASK register is inverted this effectively 
        disables the S/R register and in the second pass the value CPU
        data register will be used to alter the pixel values. 

  Actually the address of the BIT MASK REGISTER will be left in the GRAPHICS
  controller ADDRESS register, and the the draw routines will mask the required
  bits.

;	The function below will perform private stack checking. In order for
;       the checking to occur, two symbols must be defined prior to the inclu- 
;       -sion of CMACROS.INC. ?CHKSTK must be defined if the CMACROS are to
;       perform stack checking on procedures with local parameters. ?CHKSTKPROC
;       must be defined if private stack checking will be used.
;								
;	The actual body of ?CHKSTKPROC is included in MACROS.MAC
;
;	Since the stack-checking code is designed to work quickly
;	as a near subroutine, and normally resides in segment Code, a
;	duplicate is included in the segment _LINES.  To reach this,
;	the macro ?CHKSTKNAME is defined.

; us by how much we rotate the current bit and cStep (either 0,NextScan or     ;
; -NextScan) tell us by how much the current byte has to be stepped. CL will be;
; the temporary storage for rotation flag and CH will tell us whether we need  ;
; step to next scan or not. We start with CL = 1 and CH = 1, ie, we need to do ;
; rotation and step in positive Y direction. We will test the transformations  ;
