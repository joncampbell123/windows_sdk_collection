; GetInfo - return GrabInfo structure
;
;	GetInfo fills a buffer pointed to by es:di on entry with data in
;	GrabInfo format.  Note that we just copy our InfoContext structure
;	since it is a superset of the GrabInfo structure (although InfoContext
;	is not as big as GrabInfo due to reserved fields in the latter).
;
;	While Winoldap knows nothing about the reserved fields, we end up
;	filling some of them with the extra data in InfoContext because it is
;	convenient for debugging purposes.  As these fields are still
;	reserved, THEY MAY CHANGE AT ANY TIME.
;
;	For historical reasons, Winoldap insists that the return value from
;	this call also indicate whether the display is in graphics or text
;	mode.  Essentially, this provides an easy way for Windoldap to
;	determine whether or not it should attempt menuing operations, since
;	the Get/Mark/PutBlock functions are not currently supported in their
;	full generality for graphics modes.  If they should ever become
;	completely functional for graphics modes, this call must return a 1 in
;	order for Winoldap to even attempt the menu operation.
;
;	Note that the block functions themselves will also check the current
;	mode and return ERR_UNSUPPORTED to indicate non-support for the
;	request, which is the prefered way to determine support for a given
;	mode.
