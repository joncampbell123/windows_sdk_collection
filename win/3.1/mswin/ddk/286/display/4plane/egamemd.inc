;	The cursor save area and screen buffer will be allocated in
;	unused screen RAM.  This will allow the EGA's special hardware
;	to be used for moving all planes of a byte with a single movsb
;	instruction.  It will also allow the EGA's drawing modes to
;	be used for writing to all planes with a single mov instruction.
;	Besides, it also saves a lot of space!
;
;	Special EGA locations will be made public by this routine since
;	it knows exactly what must be where better than anybody else.
