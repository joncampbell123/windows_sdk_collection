Breshenham's algorithm requires moves in one of the eight basic directions,
which are:

        Positive_X              : towards increasing X value, horizontally
        Negative_X              : horizontally towards decreasing X value
        Positive_Y              : vertically towards top of display memory
        Negative_Y              : vertically towards end of display memory
        Diagonal_1Q		: diagonally in first quadrant
	Diagonal_2Q		: disgonally in second quadrant
        Diagonal_3Q		: diagonnaly in third quadrant
	Diagonal_4Q		: diagonnaly in fourth quadrant

We modify the end coordinates to ensure that lines never move to the left. This
manipulation allows us to dispense of with three of the 8 directions that    
involve movement along negative X direction.

Furthermore, the routine for Positive_Y will exactly be similar to the one for
Negative_Y, if we negate the BYTES_PER_LINE parameter and hence move towards
lower EGA DISPLAY MEMORY address with the same ADD instruction. This is also
true for Diagonal_1Q routine, which with the same manipulation can jmp off
to the Diagonal_4Q routine. The offset to the next scan line will actually be 
neagated before the draw routines, so we can dispense of with Positive_Y and
Diagonal_1Q. This is also true for the move routines.


The routines share a common set of parameters and return values

Inputs:

	DS:DI			: points to current byte in display memory
	BL			: bit position in current byte
	CX			: no of bits to set on in the specific dir.    
	DX			: address of the GRAPHICS CONTROLLER DATA reg.
	

Outputs:
	
	DS:DI			: points to the current byte after drawing line
	BL			: bit position after line drawing
	DX,SI			: unchanged
	AX,CX,BH		: destroyed

Assumptions on EGA register values:

	. WRITE MODE 0   has been programmed
        . SET/RESET registers disabled
	. COMBINE function set to REPLACE, SHIFT function to NULL
	. GRAPHICS CONTROLLER ADDRESS REGISTER contains index of BIT MASK
	  REGISTER
	. PALLETE REGISTER 0 and 15 set to the desired background and
          fore ground colours
        . SEQUENCER bit map mak register enables write to all planes

The code for each direction has carefully been planned out to save on cycles
(at the expense of bytes)

Negative_Y:

                 1. A small loop in the routine is used to draw 8 bits at a 
                    time. However the loop is opened up to output each bit
                    separately and the code for each bit takes 4 BYTES.

                 2. The last bit is always set on after the loop, so CX
                    is decremented by 1 to start with.
                  
                 3. CX is then divided by 8 to get a quotient and a remainder
                    The quotient would actually give the number of times the
                    SET_8_PIXELS loop is to be traversed. The Remainder gives
                    the last few bits (<8) to set on.
                  
                 4. To avoid having to write code to set on the last few bits
                    the following trick was done:

                        CX in step 3 is decremented by 1 before the divide
                        and the remainder incremented after the divide, this
                        ensures that the remainder will never be 0 but may
                        be 8.

                        Remember the SET_8_PIXEL loop has 8 different points
                        ,each of 4 bytes, to set on each of the 8 bits.

                        The entry point into the loop is modified so that the
                        first pass actually draws the partial bits. To do this
                        simply multiply the remainder by 4 (4 bytes for each
                        bit to be set on) and enter at that offset from the 
                        end of the loop.

                        Since the loop is also being used to draw the partial
                        bits, the quotient of the division is incremented by
                        one to account for the extra pass.

Positive_X

If CX has the no of bits to set on, dec CX to get the bits to move in the 
specified direction.

Divide CX by 8 to get a quotient and a remainder. The quotient gives the
number of bytes to move and the strting bit position shifted in the specified
direction by the remainder gives the ending bit position.

All bits between the starting bit position and the ending bit position have
to be set on. Hence,

        if bh has the starting bit position and bl the ending bit

        MASK FOR FIRST BYTE = 2 * BL - 1  (set all bits to the right and incl-
                                           uding the starting bit to 1)
        MASK FOR LAST BYTE  = neg BH      (sets all bits to the left of and
                                           including the original bit to 1)

        MASK FOR ALL INTERVENING BYTES = 0ffh

Incase the starting and ending bits fall on the same byte, AND the initial
and final FILTERs.      

Note, that if the position in a byte of the final bit is to the left of
the position of the initial byte, the quotient above has to be incremented
by 1. The quotient after this update gives one less the number of bytes
affected.

A simple loop outputs the bits, each time going a bit to the right and a
bit down. The current bit position is used as a FILTER to set up the bits.
