;	text (B0000h-B7000h) address area or leave it alone, allowing
;	other devices to use the address space.  Note that the
;	VGAMONOTEXT entry is new for 3.1.  It provides for the case
;	where there is no secondary display or secondary display
;	device but the user still does not want VGA mono support.
;	Also note that for 3.1 it is not an error if we attempt to
;	provide VGA mono support but some other device has grabbed
;	the address space already (we just won't support VGA mono).
;	Following is a description of the logic followed:
;
;   IF
;	1) Secondary VDD does not exist (it will reserve it)
;	    AND
;	2) "DUALDISPLAY=YES" OR Secondary display is detected
;	    AND
;	3) Other VxD (e.g. Upper Memory Blocks) has not reserved pages B0-B7
;
;   THEN Reserve and map pages B0-B7 physical for secondary display.
;	    The memory is address space is not available for any use other
;	    than accessing the physical memory at pages B0-B7.
;
;   ELSE IF
;	1) Secondary VDD does not exist (it will reserve it)

;	3) NOT ("VGAMONOTEXT=NO")
;	    AND
;	4) "VGAMONOTEXT=YES" OR Windows started when video in mono mode
;	    AND
;	5) Other VxD (e.g. Upper Memory Blocks) has not reserved pages B0-B7
;
;   THEN Reserve and hook pages B0-B7 for VGA mono support.
;
;   ELSE VGA Mono not supported, pages B0-B7 not handled.  The address space
;	    is available for any use.  This may be by a 2nd VDD or by a
;	    DOS UMB or by translation buffers from protected mode to virtual
;	    mode.
;
; If user sets "DUALDISPLAY=NO" with monochrome adapter attached the results
;	are undefined.	In this case we may provide VGA mono support which
;	will conflict with the existing secondary monochrome display.

;   Some VGA adapters have ROM at C6 and C7 but do not put a ROM signature
;   in the ROM, so the V86MMGR determines that it is free address space and
;   uses it for buffers.  If this is set TRUE, or the VDD detects one of these
;   ROMs, we will exclude the memory from C6000h to C7FFFh from other usage
;   and the memory will always be addressable.	If this is set FALSE, we will
;   not do anything and the address space may be reused by the system or used
;   for any other reason.

;
; INI entry for disabling automatic save/restore of other display API aware
;   applications.
;   Default is TRUE, so that automatic save/restore is enabled.  Setting this
;   switch to FALSE, avoids allocating save memory for applications which
;   notify enhanced mode Windows that they know how to restore/repaint their
;   screen themselves.	By setting this switch to FALSE, switching to some
;   applications may be somewhat slower, because the application will be
;   responsible for repainting its screen which usually takes more time than
;   if Windows handles the screen restore automatically.

;******************************************************************************
;
; INI entry for changing when the automatic save/restore background
; notification is sent.  For displays that don't have special display
; hardware (e.g. blitters), it is possible to hold off sending a
; background notification into a VM until it actually page faults.
; The VDD will then send the notification and map NULL memory so the
; VM can proceed, but doesn't access actual video memory.  For displays
; that do have special display hardware, waiting until a page fault
; may be to late, because it may be trying to access video memory
; directly on the adapter, so there may not even be a page fault!  On
; these displays it is necessary to send the background notification
; as early as possible.
;
; Setting this switch to FALSE forces the early notification, setting it
; to TRUE specifies that the notification can wait until page fault time.
;
; The default setting for VGA is TRUE, and for 8514 it is FALSE.

; INI entry for disabling the use of the soft font stored in the video ROM for
; the message mode font (the font used in full screen message text and in the
; switcher screen displayed when switching away from a DOS VM.)  Set this
; switch to FALSE to disable.  This switch would be used on machines where a
; different soft font is programmed by a TSR or device driver, etc. or where
; the video ROM is banked so that the font isn't always addressable.  The
; first possibility would be identified by seeing that the font in message
; mode is different from the normally used font.  The second possibility would
; be identified by seeing random dots and weird shapes that appear in rows and
; columns like text, but aren't readable; this condition indicates that the
; font is not programmed correctly.

;******************************************************************************

; INI entry for disabling the option of running the Windows VM in the 2nd bank
; of video memory.  Many super VGA adapters have 512Kb or more of video memory.
; On some of these it is possible for the VDD to run the Windows VM in the 2nd
; bank of 256Kb when using the standard VGA.DRV or SUPERVGA.DRV.  This allows
; switching from DOS VM's back to the Windows VM without repainting all of the
; Windows apps.  Setting this switch to FALSE disables this feature.

IFDEF IBMXGA
;******************************************************************************
;
; INI entry for enabling the software fix for a compatibility difference
; between standard VGA and some IBM implementations of VGA.  This switch
; needs to be set to TRUE on machines that have XGA hardware enabled, but
; Windows is installed with the VGA driver.  And it should also be set to
; TRUE on other IBM machines, such as the Model 75 portable, where the user
; experiences problems with windowed text mode VM's.  Usually the problem
; shows as missing every other character in the windowed VM, and if the VM
; is switched to full screen the display is total trash, because the font
; is no longer programmed correctly.  Currently we only know of this being
; a problem on IBM PS/2 machines, and we don't know which models actually
; have this problem.
