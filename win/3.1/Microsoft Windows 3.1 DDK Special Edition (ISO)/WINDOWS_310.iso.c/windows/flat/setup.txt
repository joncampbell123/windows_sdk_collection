SETUP.TXT
=========

This file contains information about problems that may occur 
while running Windows Setup and describes problems that can
occur when using terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs
or drivers with Windows or Windows Setup. If you are using 
a TSR or if you encounter problems setting up Windows version 
3.1, read this document BEFORE running Setup again.


General Setup Notes
====================
This section includes notes on specific system configurations 
that may prevent Setup from installing Windows successfully.
A solution to each problem is provided.

If you are using a hardware or software product listed here,
follow the proposed recommendations before running Setup.


MS-DOS Screen Savers
---------------------
If you are using an MS-DOS screen saver, you should disable 
it before running Setup. These screen savers can cause problems
when running Setup.


COMPAQ Computer with MS-DOS Version 5.0 and EGA or VGA 
---------------------------------------------------------
If you are using the upgrade version of Microsoft MS-DOS 
5.0, check your CONFIG.SYS file to make sure the following
drivers appear in this order:

    HIMEM.SYS 
    EMM386.EXE
    ANSI.SYS

Note: If you are using the COMPAQ version of MS-DOS 5.0,     
      HIMEM.EXE is used in place of HIMEM.SYS and CEMM.EXE
      is used in place of EMM386.EXE.

If ANSI.SYS is loaded before HIMEM.SYS or EMM386.EXE (or if
you are using COMPAQ MS-DOS 5.0 before HIMEM.EXE or CEMM.EXE),
Setup may restart your system before Windows is installed. 
Also, if you are using the DOS=HIGH,UMB command line to load 
MS-DOS into upper memory, loading EMM386.EXE (or CEMM.EXE)
before loading ANSI.SYS will create the maximum amount of
upper memory space on a COMPAQ computer.


AT&T Safari Computer
--------------------
If you have an AT&T Safari computer, you cannot maintain two
versions of Windows (version 3.0 and version 3.1) on your 
system. You must upgrade over version 3.0. If you set up 
Windows 3.1 in its own directory, Windows will not use the 
special drivers required for it to run on the Safari computer.


Using the TIGA Display Driver
-------------------------------
If you are using the TIGA display driver, you must load the 
TIGACD.EXE MS-DOS driver manually before running Setup 
to upgrade Windows. Otherwise, Windows will not upgrade 
your system properly. 

After successfully setting up Windows, you can increase the 
amount of conventional memory available to non-Windows 
applications when Windows is running in 386 enhanced mode 
by loading TIGACD.EXE from the WINSTART.BAT file. The 
WINSTART.BAT file runs only in 386 enhanced mode. If you 
want to run Windows in standard mode, you must load 
TIGACD.EXE manually. For more information, see the README.WRI 
online document.


Displays That Are Incompatible with Windows Version 3.1
-------------------------------------------------------
Certain display adapters can cause problems with Windows 
version 3.1. The most serious problem is a system 
failure while running Windows Setup. If you encounter this 
problem, run Custom Setup, and then select one of the standard 
display types, such as VGA, provided with Windows version 3.1. 

With other display drivers, Windows may be set up successfully 
but TrueType fonts may not appear correctly on your screen. 
An updated driver may be available in the Windows Driver 
Library or from your display vendor or manufacturer. For 
information about obtaining the Windows Driver Library, 
see "Getting Started with Microsoft Windows." 

The following display adapters may cause problems:

-  ATI Graphics Ultra and Vantage

   NOTE: These adapters are 8514/a-compatible and run well 
         with the 8514/a driver provided with Windows 3.1.

- All DGIS display adapters (Direct Graphics Interface Standard) 
  from Graphic Software Systems, including the following:
        NEC MultiSynch Graphics Engine (MGE)
        Zenith Z-649             
        HP IGC-10, IGC-20
        GSS 1000 Series 

   NOTE: Some DGIS-based adapters are TIGA-compatible and
         run well when used with the appropriate TIGACD.EXE
         MS-DOS driver and with the TIGA driver provided with 
         Windows 3.1.

- HP Ultra VGA
- IBM Image Adapter/A  
- Matrox MG Series/M-WIN Series
- Palettized VGA 640x480, 16-color (provided with Windows
  Multimedia Extensions version 1.0)
- Radius SVGA MultiView

- All RGDI (Renaissance Graphics Device Interface) display
  adapters from Appian, Inc., including the following:
       Appian Rendition II, IIe, II/XE, and III
       Appian GV1024
       Decpc 433

- All S3 adapters, including the following:
      Orchid Fahrenheit 1280
      STB WIND/X
      Diamond Stealth VRAM


Using Stacker
-------------
If you are using Stacker to compress your hard disk, there are 
certain steps you need to take before setting up Windows. 

*  If you want to use a swap file with Windows, you must
   set up the swap file on the uncompressed drive. When 
   setting up Stacker, you can leave at least 1 megabyte (MB)
   of disk space uncompressed for storing system files. To 
   leave enough space for the swap file, it is recommended 
   that the amount of uncompressed disk space equal at least 
   twice the amount of system memory. For example, if your 
   system has 4 MB of memory, you should leave at least 8 MB 
   of disk space uncompressed. 

   If Stacker is already set up on your system and there is not 
   enough uncompressed disk space for a swap file, you can run 
   the STAC utility provided with Stacker to increase the amount 
   of uncompressed disk space. For more information, see your 
   Stacker documentation.

*  If you are using Stacker version 2.0 or later, Windows Setup
   modifies your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. When Setup
   is finished making the modifications, it displays a message
   at the end of the Windows portion of Setup notifying you of
   the modifications. If you have used Stacker to swap your 
   startup drive, when you restart your system Stacker will
   ask whether you want to update to the new version of the 
   CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file. It is recommended that you
   update.

   If you are using a version of Stacker earlier than 2.0, you
   may need to modify your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files 
   yourself. For more information, see "Modifying Your CONFIG.SYS
   and AUTOEXEC.BAT Files Yourself," following this topic.

*  For best performance, do not use SMARTDrive to cache the
   compressed drive. You only need to cache the uncompressed 
   drive. You can include options on the SMARTDRV.EXE line of
   the CONFIG.SYS file to specify which drives to cache. 

   For example, if the Stacker swap utility swaps drives C and
   D so that C is compressed and D is uncompressed, you would 
   include the following line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

        device=\windows\smartdrv.exe C- D+
 
For more information about swap files and using SMARTDrive, see
Chapter 14, "Optimizing Windows," in the "Microsoft Windows User's 
Guide."


Modifying Your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT Files Yourself
---------------------------------------------------------
When you set up Windows, Setup usually places the HIMEM.SYS, 
SMARTDRV.EXE, and EMM386.EXE files in the Windows directory. 
If the Windows directory is on a disk that is not available 
when you start your computer, such as a removable or nonlocal 
disk, or if Setup detects one of the following conditions,
Setup does not modify the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

- Your boot drive has been modified by a disk-compression 
  utility.

- Your CONFIG.SYS file contains references to block device 
  drivers.

- There is not enough available space on your hard disk to 
  copy the files.

- The files are already installed on your system and Setup
  cannot overwrite them (they are read-only).

Instead, Setup writes proposed changes to the CONFIG.WIN and 
AUTOEXEC.WIN or the CONFIG.00x and AUTOEXEC.00x files. 
In this case, you must either move the HIMEM.SYS, SMARTDRV.EXE, 
and EMM386.EXE files to a drive that is available when you start 
your computer, or use a text editor to modify your CONFIG.SYS or
AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that any references to HIMEM.SYS, 
SMARTDRV.EXE, and EMM386.EXE appear after the device= 
command line used to load the drivers for your disk drives. Refer 
to the CONFIG.WIN and AUTOEXEC.WIN or the CONFIG.00x and 
AUTOEXEC.00x files for the proposed changes.


Setting Up XGA on a PS/2 Model 75 or 90
-----------------------------------------------------
If you have a PS/2 model 75 or 90 with an XGA, Windows 
Setup will configure the display adapter for 16-color, 
640x480 resolution. Do not change this configuration 
during Setup. Specifying a different XGA configuration 
while setting up Windows may cause Setup to fail.

After you have successfully installed Windows, you can 
configure your XGA to use a different resolution or 256 colors, 
if your monitor supports it. For more information on how to do 
this, see the topic "IBM XGA" in the README.WRI online 
document.  

If you are using the plasma screen on the PS/2 model 75, use 
ONLY the 640x480, 16-color configuration. If you change this
configuration, you will be returned to the MS-DOS prompt when 
you try to start Windows. 


Correcting the "Out of Environment Space" Error Message
-------------------------------------------------------
If you receive an "out of environment space" message when 
starting Windows, you can either:

*  Increase the size of your environment by adding the SHELL= 
   command line to your CONFIG.SYS file. See your MS-DOS 
   documentation for more information about the SHELL command
   and modifying your CONFIG.SYS file.

*  Move the SET commands in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file 
   to the beginning of the file so that they run before the
   commands that load terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)
   programs or drivers, such as SMARTDrive.


If Windows Setup Does Not Detect Your Network
---------------------------------------------
If you have a network installed and Setup specifies "No
Network" in the System-Information screen, Setup is not
able to detect your network. For Setup to detect certain 
networks, the directory that contains the network program 
files must be included in your path. 

This is a known problem with these networks: 3Share, 3Open, 
LAN Manager, and MSNet. If your path does not include the
directory where the network files are located, you can either:

*  Add the directory to the PATH line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT 
   file. 

*  Run Custom Setup and specify the full path for your
   network in the System-Information screen.


Using Terminate-and-Stay-Resident (TSR) Programs and Drivers
with Windows Version 3.1
=============================================================

The Program Listing section of this document lists several 
terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs and drivers that
are known to cause problems when running with Windows version 
3.1. Some of the problems you may encounter include system 
failures or an incorrect display of information on your screen. 
In some cases, special steps are provided to solve the problems.

While setting up Windows version 3.1, Windows Setup searches 
the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files for references to TSR 
programs and drivers, in addition to scanning memory for TSRs 
that are currently running. If Setup detects a TSR that is 
known to cause problems when running with Windows version 3.1, 
a message appears, asking whether you want to continue or quit 
Setup.

If you receive such a message, do the following:

1. Locate your TSR in the Program Listing section of this document 
   and use the information to determine if the situation encountered
   prevents Windows Setup from successfully installing Windows 3.1.

2. If the situation does not affect Windows Setup, you can continue 
   setting up Windows 3.1 by following the instructions on your 
   screen.
   
   If the situation does affect Windows Setup and prevents it from 
   installing Windows on your computer, follow the instructions 
   on the screen to quit Setup, and then complete the following 
   steps.

3. Quit the TSR and remove all references to it from your 
   AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files. For more information, 
   see the documentation for your TSR.

4. Restart your computer.

5. Run Windows Setup again.

After Windows is successfully set up, you may want to restore 
your TSRs. 

Not all TSRs or drivers included in the Program Listing section
are detected by Setup. The TSRs and drivers that Setup detects
are in the SETUP.INF file, listed under the names "incomptsr1" 
and "incomptsr2".


Program Listing
===============
This section describes some problems, discovered during testing,
that you might encounter while using a TSR with Windows version 3.1. 
It does not include all possible problems that can occur.

386MAX 
------
The documentation for 386MAX recommends against setting the 
EXT parameter below 64. If you set this parameter to 0, Windows 
Setup and Windows running in standard mode will fail.  

See the README.WRI online document for more information 
about running 386MAX with Windows 3.1.

386MAX Disk-Cache Utility (QCACHE.EXE)
--------------------------------------
Do not use this disk-cache utility simultaneously with SMARTDrive. 
There is no reason to use two disk-cache utilities with Windows. 
It is recommended that you use SMARTDrive, which is installed 
with Windows 3.1, instead.

All Charge 386 Version 3.1 
-------------------------- 
ALLEMM4.SYS is a memory manager that causes problems with
Setup and Windows 3.1. If you encounter problems running 
this program with Windows, it is recommended that you use 
EMM386.EXE and HIMEM.SYS, provided with Windows 3.1, to 
manage memory instead.  

Anarkey Version 4.00
--------------------
With some memory configurations, Anarkey version 4.00 running
with Windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode may cause unpredictable 
system failures. In rare cases, this program can also corrupt
hard-disk data. In addition, Windows 3.1 might not start when
this program is running.

Do not run Windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode when Anarkey version 
4.00 is running. Version 4.01 may correct these problems. Contact
Moderne Software for a free upgrade of Anarkey 4.01.

Anarkey Version 4.01
--------------------
If Anarkey version 4.01 is loaded before starting Windows in 
standard mode, it is not available in any MS-DOS Prompt that 
you start from Windows. In this case, it is recommended that 
you load Anarkey from each MS-DOS Prompt, as needed.  

Do not load Anarkey HIGH before starting Windows in 386
enhanced mode. If you load Anarkey HIGH, your system may 
fail when you try to start an application. 

APPEND (MS-DOS)
---------------
Do not use the APPEND utility with Windows 3.1. It prevents
Windows and Windows applications from creating valid 
Well-Formed-Path (WFP) names for the files they are using.  
(A WFP is the complete name of a file, including the drive 
letter and full path specification, starting from the root 
directory.)

ASP Integrity Toolkit Version 3.7
---------------------------------
This product is a virus-protection program that can cause 
problems when running Windows Setup, including system 
failure, automatic restarting of the system, and the inability 
to use the keyboard. You should turn off protection in the
toolkit before setting up Windows 3.1. For information about
how to do this, see your ASP Integrity documentation.

NOTE: Setting up Windows is considered a system-administration 
      task. The ASP Integrity Toolkit documentation instructs 
      you to turn off protection when performing these types 
      of tasks. 

Autocon Version 2.0e 
--------------------
Autocon enables you to select up to fifty different configurations 
when starting your system. To do this, it modifies the CONFIG.SYS 
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files, based on information in its database 
(AUTOCON.DAT), when you restart your system from within 
AUTOCON. 

Windows Setup modifies only the first section in the CONFIG.SYS
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. If you want to use specific configurations 
with Windows, you must run Autocon and then manually edit the 
configurations in the database that you want to use. You must do
this after setting up Windows. For your changes to take effect,
you must restart your system from within Autocon. For more 
information, see your Autocon documentation.

Bootcon Version 1.60
--------------------
Using Bootcon, you can maintain different system-configuration
information in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. You can
then select the configuration you want to use from a menu when 
starting your system. 

Windows Setup modifies only the first section in the CONFIG.SYS 
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. You must edit the sections of those files 
that contain the configurations you want to use after you set up 
Windows. For more information, see your Bootcon documentation.

BOOT.SYS
---------
Using BOOT.SYS, you can maintain different system-configuration
information in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. You can
then select the configuration you want to use from a menu when 
starting your system. 

Windows Setup modifies only the first section in the CONFIG.SYS 
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. You must edit the sections of those files
that contain the configurations you want to use after you set 
up Windows. For more information, see your BOOT.SYS documentation.


CACHE.EXE Disk-Cache Utility
----------------------------
Do not use two disk-cache utilities with Windows 3.1. It is 
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows 3.1, 
and remove all references to other disk-cache utilities from 
your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If CACHE.EXE is detected, 
Setup removes it from the CONFIG.SYS file for you.)

CACHE.SYS Disk-Cache Utility
----------------------------
This disk-cache utility will not work properly with SMARTDrive. 
It is recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with 
Windows 3.1, and remove all references to other disk-cache 
utilities from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If 
CACHE.SYS is detected, Setup removes it from the CONFIG.SYS file 
for you.)

CED Version 1.0e
----------------
Using CED with Windows 3.1 may cause problems, including 
system failure. It is recommended that you do not use CED 
with Windows 3.1.

Central Point Anti-Virus Version 1.1 (VSAFE.COM/VSAFE.SYS)
----------------------------------------------------------
VSAFE.COM/VSAFE.SYS should not be loaded when you set up
Windows 3.1. Otherwise, Setup may not run properly. After 
you set up Windows 3.1, you can load VSAFE.  

Because Windows uses the disk for memory swapping, you should
turn off the VSAFE write-protection option when running Windows. 
For more information, see the Central Point Anti-Virus 
documentation.

CMDEDIT.COM Version 2.0 (Date 12-6-91)
--------------------------------------
If this command-line editor is loaded before starting Windows,
it may cause a General Protection Fault when running multiple MS-
DOS Prompts in 386 enhanced mode. Also, it cannot be loaded 
from an MS-DOS Prompt within Windows when Windows is
running in standard mode. 
 
Cubit Version 3.01
------------------
When using Cubit with Windows 3.1, do not compress the 
Windows SYSTEM directory or any file that is loaded from 
the CONFIG.SYS file. Compressing these files could cause 
problems.  

Before upgrading to Windows 3.1, make sure that the earlier 
version of Windows is uncompressed on your hard disk. You 
may recompress the files after you have successfully set up 
Windows 3.1.

Data Physician Plus Version 2.0 (VirALERT)
------------------------------------------
It is recommended that you do not set up Windows while
VirALERT is running. If you do, VirALERT will display a 
warning message every few seconds while Setup is running.

After you have set up Windows, you can run VirALERT. Press
ALT+V to display the VirALERT menu. You can use the commands 
on this menu to disable and enable VirALERT.

DOSCUE.COM Command-Line Editor
------------------------------
The DOSCUE command-line editor produces unexpected results
when used with Windows version 3.1. It is recommended that you 
do not use this editor with Windows 3.1.

Doubledisk Version 2.5
----------------------
Windows 3.1 may try to access "phantom" disk drives if you use
Doubledisk with Windows 3.1. Phantom drives occur when you 
use Doubledisk to create a compressed drive. For example, if you 
have drives A, B, and C on your computer and you use Doubledisk 
to create drive F, Windows 3.1 (and MS-DOS) recognize drives D 
and E as valid drives, even though they do not actually exist. You 
can use the DRVOFF utility to prevent Windows from recognizing 
phantom drives. Contact Vertisoft to order a copy of the DRVOFF
utility.

FASTOPEN (MS-DOS)
-----------------
FASTOPEN is a RAM resident utility. Problems involving the
file allocation table (FAT) may occur if FASTOPEN is used
together with disk de-fragmenting utilities. In low-memory 
situations, you may need to remove FASTOPEN for Windows 
3.1 to run properly.

Flash Disk-Cache Utility (FLASH.EXE)
-------------------------------------
Do not use this disk-cache utility simultaneously with SMARTDrive. 
There is no reason to use two disk-cache utilities with Windows. 
It is recommended that you use SMARTDrive, which is installed with 
Windows 3.1, instead.

Graphics (MS-DOS)
-----------------
Loading Graphics from an MS-DOS Prompt within Windows can cause 
unexpected results when printing. The active MS-DOS Prompt will 
send its output to the printer. Switching between MS-DOS Prompts
may result in mixed printing jobs.  

HPEMM386.SYS and HPEMM486.SYS
-----------------------------
These expanded-memory managers are incompatible with Windows 
when it is running in 386 enhanced mode. If you plan on running 
Windows in 386 enhanced mode, it is recommended that you use 
EMM386.EXE to manage memory instead.

HPMM.SYS - HP Memory Manager
----------------------------
When HPMM.SYS is running, you cannot set up Windows 3.1 or
run it in standard mode. You should remove all references to
HPMM.SYS from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files before
setting up Windows 3.1.

Hyperdisk Disk-Cache Utility 
----------------------------
Do not use this disk-cache utility simultaneously with SMARTDrive. 
There is no reason to use two disk-cache utilities with Windows. 
It is recommended that you use SMARTDrive, which is installed with 
Windows 3.1, instead.

IBM VDISK.SYS (RAM Disk Utility)
--------------------------------
VDISK.SYS is incompatible with Windows because it occupies
extended memory required to run Windows. This utility prevents
any XMS-compatible memory manager from loading.

IEMM.SYS Memory Manager
-----------------------
The IEMM.SYS memory manager is incompatible with Windows.
It is recommended that you remove all references to IEMM.SYS 
from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files and use
EMM386.EXE, provided with Windows 3.1, to manage memory
instead.

ICACHE.SYS Disk-Cache Utility
-----------------------------
Do not use two disk-cache utilities with Windows version
3.1. It is recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with 
Windows 3.1, and remove all references to other disk-cache 
utilities from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If 
ICACHE.SYS is detected, Setup removes it from the CONFIG.SYS 
file for you.)

IBMCACHE.SYS Disk-Cache Utility
-------------------------------
Do not use two disk-cache utilities with Windows version
3.1. It is recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with 
Windows 3.1, and remove all references to other disk-cache 
utilities from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If 
IBMCACHE.SYS is detected, Setup removes it from the CONFIG.SYS 
file for you.)

Intel Expanded-Memory Emulator (ILIM386.SYS)
--------------------------------------------
The ILIM386.SYS expanded-memory emulator, provided with the 
Intel Inboard/386 product, is incompatible with Windows 3.1.  
It is recommended that you remove all references to this emulator 
from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files before setting 
up Windows 3.1.

JOIN (MS-DOS)
-------------
Do not add or remove "joined" drives while running Windows 3.1.  
If you use the JOIN command before starting Windows 3.1 and 
do not change the state of the joined drives from an MS-DOS 
Prompt within Windows, Windows 3.1 will work properly.  
It is recommended that you do not use joined drives at all if 
you plan on running Windows.

KBFLOW TSR by Artisoft
----------------------
If you load the KBFLOW TSR utility provided by Artisoft
before starting Windows 3.1, your system may fail when 
starting or using an MS-DOS Prompt from within Windows.

KEYB.COM (MS-DOS)
-----------------
If you use command-line options to load KEYB.COM, it is 
recommended that you load it before starting Windows. 
After it is loaded, you can change the keyboard configuration 
from an MS-DOS Prompt within Windows any time. If you do not 
load KEYB.COM before starting windows, you may encounter 
problems using a KEYB command that includes an option in an 
MS-DOS Prompt. However, you can use the KEYB command without
options at any time to display code-page information.

Lansight Version 2.0
--------------------
Lansight is a utility that you can use to control and monitor
other workstations attached to a Novell network. In some cases, 
version 2.0 of Lansight may cause the workstation running 
Windows 3.1 to fail.

Lasertool Control Panel Version 2.2
------------------------------------
If you load version 2.2 of the Lasertool Control Panel 
program (PCPANEL.EXE) from Windows 3.1, your system may fail. 
This program works properly if you load it before starting 
Windows.
 
Le Menu Version 1.0
-------------------
When using Le Menu version 1.0 with Windows 3.1, environment 
information such as PATH, PROMPT and WINDIR may be lost 
if you start an MS-DOS Prompt from within Windows. If you 
want to start Windows 3.1 by using a Le Menu menu command, 
it is recommended that you set up Windows 3.1 as a Batch-File 
menu command so that COMMAND.COM will load before starting 
Windows 3.1. For more information, see your Le Menu documentation.

LOCKIT Version 3.3 (PC Vault, Secure It)
----------------------------------------
Version 3.3 of these programs strip out spaces from the load= 
command line in the WIN.INI file. Later versions may correct 
this problem.

Logitech Mouse Software Version 5.0/6.0 (CLICK, LOGIMENU)
----------------------------------------------------------
If you want to use CLICK and LOGIMENU from an MS-DOS 
Prompt within Windows, you must load the TSRs from that 
MS-DOS Prompt, even if you loaded the TSRs before starting 
Windows. When you quit Windows, you must reload the TSRs 
for them to work properly from the MS-DOS prompt outside of 
Windows, even if you loaded them from an MS-DOS Prompt within 
Windows.

Mace Disk-Cache Utility (MCACHE.SYS)
------------------------------------
This disk-cache utility will not work properly with SMARTDrive.
It is recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows 3.1, 
and remove all references to other disk-cache utilities from your 
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If Mace is detected, Setup 
removes it from the CONFIG.SYS file for you.)


Maximizer Memory Manager (MAXIMIZE.COM)
---------------------------------------
If you are using the Maximizer memory manager, you may not be able
to set up or start Windows. Make sure that you are using only one
memory manager with Windows 3.1. It is recommended that you use 
HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE, which are installed with Windows 3.1, 
to manage memory instead.  

MIRROR (MS-DOS)
-----------------
If MIRROR is loaded from Windows 3.1 by using the Run command in
standard mode, you cannot remove it from memory by using the 
MIRROR /U command. This will cause an error message to appear.

NDOSEDIT.COM (Date 1-1-84)
--------------------------
You may have problems loading this command-line editor. Also,
it may cause unexpected results when running with Windows 3.1.   

NetRoom Memory Manager (RM386.SYS)
-------------------------------------------
With some older versions of NetRoom, you may encounter 
problems setting up Windows. In this case, contact Helix 
Software for a newer version of NetRoom.

Newspace Version 1.07
---------------------
This disk-compression utility is incompatible with Windows
3.1 and may cause several problems.

Norton Anti-Virus Version 1.0
-----------------------------
If you load version 1.0 of Anti-Virus before setting up Windows,
Setup may fail. It is recommended that you contact Symantec for 
the most current version of this program.

Norton Desktop for Windows (EP.EXE)
-----------------------------------
If the data-recovery program Erase Protect (EP.EXE) is loaded 
from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, you need to disable it when setting
up Windows 3.1, especially if you are upgrading over a previous 
version of Windows. Erase Protect tries to save copies of all 
deleted files, which can cause you to run out of disk space 
while running Setup.

It is recommended that you run Erase Protect with a permanent 
swap file, not a temporary swap file. If you are using a 
temporary swap file, you need to exclude files with a .TMP 
or .SWP extension from erase protection.

Norton Utilities Version 5.0 (DISKREET, NCACHE)
-----------------------------------------------
This program is incompatible with Windows 3.1 and may cause 
your system to fail. It is recommended that you upgrade to 
the most recent version of Norton Utilities to correct problems.

Norton Utilities Version. 6.01 (NCACHE)
---------------------------------------
Some versions of NCACHE may prevent you from setting up or 
starting Windows 3.1. When Windows is running in standard 
mode, your system may fail, especially if NCACHE is set up 
as an EMS cache. Setting up NCACHE as an EMS cache is not
recommended. Setting up NCACHE as an XMS cache may solve
the problem.

You may also encounter additional problems using NCACHE.
New versions may correct these problems. For an updated version
of NCACHE, contact Symantec Corporation. In the meantime, you 
can use SMARTDrive, which is provided with Windows 3.1.

--------------------------------------
It is recommended that you do not use DISKMON version 6.01
with Windows 3.1. 

PCED Version 2.00
-----------------
Do not load the PCED command-line editor HIGH. Loading it 
HIGH may cause unexpected results, such as system failures, 
when Windows is running in 386 enhanced mode. If you load 
this program before starting Windows, it may be unavailable
when Windows is running in standard mode.

PCKEY.EXE (MultiSoft Keyboard Enhancer and Command-Line Stack)
--------------------------------------------------------------

3.1, instead.

PC-Kwik Version. 1.59 (PCK.EXE, PSKSCRN.EXE, PCKEY.COM)
-------------------------------------------------------
If version 1.59 of PC-KWIK is loaded before setting up Windows,
Setup may fail. PC-KWIK Version 2.0 may correct this problem.

PCSXMAEM.SYS Utility
--------------------
This utility is incompatible with Windows. You should remove 
all references to it from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
files before setting up or starting Windows 3.1. PCSXMAEM.SYS
is similar to XMAEM.SYS. It has been renamed and slightly
modified. It is provided with current versions of the IBM PC/3270 
emulator.

PCSX2EMS.SYS
-------------
Windows will run correctly with PCSX2EMS.SYS if it is loaded 
on a computer that has an XMA board installed. Otherwise, this 
program is incompatible with Windows. PCSX2EMS.SYS is
provided with the IBM PC/3270 emulator.  

PC Tools Deluxe Version 7.1 (DATAMON)
------------------------------------
If you load PC Tools DATAMON using the \SENTRY+ option,
Setup may fail if you are low on disk space. Do not use the
\SENTRY+ option when loading DATAMON.

is loaded after SMARTDrive, your system may fail. See the
PC Tools documentation for information about how to unload 
DATAMON.

PC Tools Deluxe Version 6.0 (DESKTOP)
------------------------------------
If you try to start PC Tools from an MS-DOS Prompt within 
Windows in standard mode, your system may fail. In enhanced 
mode, your system may restart itself. These problems also occur 
if you use MS-DOS commands from an MS-DOS Prompt within
Windows.

Version 7.0 of PC Tools may correct these problems.  However, 
do not load DESKTOP from an MS-DOS Prompt if it was loaded 
before starting Windows 3.1. If you do, your system may fail
when you quit Windows. It is recommended that you run DESKTOP
from its PIF, provided with Windows 3.1.

PC Tools Deluxe Version 7.1 (VDEFEND)
-------------------------------------
Setup may not work properly if VDEFEND is loaded before running
Setup. You may load VDEFEND after setting up Windows 3.1.

PC Tools Disk-Cache Utility (PC-CACHE.COM)
-----------------------------------------
Do not use this disk-cache utility simultaneously with SMARTDrive. 
There is no reason to use two disk-cache utilities with Windows.
It is recommended that you use SMARTDrive, which is installed with 
Windows 3.1, instead.

PRINT (MS-DOS)
--------------
If you are printing several large documents on a network printer 
and run Windows Setup from the network, your system may 
fail while Setup is creating Program Manager groups.

Printer Assist Version 4.20
---------------------------
Printer Assist is a TSR that you can use to share a
workstation printer with other workstations on Netware 286
and 386 systems. Some Windows applications (such as Microsoft
Word for Windows) print extended characters, mixed with correct 
output when this program is loaded.  

PYRO! Version 1.0
-----------------
If this screen saver is loaded before starting Windows 3.1, you may 
not be able to restore the Windows 3.1 screen after this screen saver
appears. 

QMAPS Memory Manager Version 5.16
---------------------------------
If you are using the QMAPS memory manager, you may not be able
to set up or start Windows. New versions may correct these problems.
For an updated version of QMAPS, contact Quadtel. In the meantime, you
may use HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE, provided with Windows 3.1, to manage
memory instead.  

RAMTYPE.SYS - AST RAMpage! Boards
---------------------------------
The RAMTYPE.SYS driver is incompatible with Windows. It is 
recommended that you remove this driver before setting up
Windows 3.1. If you load the driver from your CONFIG.SYS 
file, comment out the command line for the driver as follows:

   rem RAMTYPE.SYS 

Windows 3.1 will run correctly without RAMTYPE.SYS. However,
other drivers that rely on RAMTYPE.SYS will not load and 
applications will not be able to use the expanded memory on 
your system. 

After setting up Windows, you can use version 1.2 and later of 
RAMTYPE.SYS with Windows. If you are using an earlier version
on an IBM PS/2 or micro-channel architecture computer and 
your RAMpage! board is configured for expanded and extended 
memory, you need to upgrade your AST RAMTYPE.SYS driver after 
setting up Windows. You will also need to remove the "rem" 
command from your CONFIG.SYS file so that RAMTYPE.SYS will 
load properly.

Secretdisk II Disk-Cache Utility (FAST512.SYS)
----------------------------------------------
This disk-cache utility will not work properly with SMARTDrive.
It is recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows
3.1, and remove all references to other disk-cache utilities from
your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If this utility is detected, 
Setup removes it from the CONFIG.SYS file for you).


SideKick Versions 1.0 and 2.0 and SideKick Plus
-----------------------------------------------
Miscellaneous problems may occur when running SideKick as a TSR
with Windows 3.1. It is recommended that you use a PIF to run  
SideKick as a non-Windows application, instead of loading it
as a TSR.

SoftIce Debugger
----------------
If SoftIce is loaded, Setup will fail when starting the Windows
portion of the program. It is recommended that you unload SoftIce
before setting up Windows 3.1.

SpeedFXR
--------
This program is incompatible with Windows 3.1 when running as a 
TSR. It tries to increase the speed of the floppy disk drives,
but slows them down instead. To get the best results, use the 
-X option when loading SpeedFXR. This will prevent SpeedFXR from 
remaining in memory and affecting the speed of the floppy disk
drives.

SUBST (MS-DOS)
--------------
Do not add or remove "substituted" drives while running Windows 3.1.  
If you use the SUBST command before starting Windows and do not 
change the state of the substituted drives from an MS-DOS Prompt within
Windows, Windows 3.1 will work properly.  

Super PC-Kwik Disk-Cache Utility (SUPERPCK.EXE)
-----------------------------------------------
Do not use this disk-cache utility simultaneously with SMARTDrive. 
There is no reason to use two disk-cache utilities with Windows.
It is recommended that you use SMARTDrive, which is installed with 
Windows 3.1, instead.

Trantor T100 Host Adapter Driver (TSCSI.SYS)
--------------------------------------------
(For SCSI hard disk drives) - If you use the Trantor T100 
driver (TSCSI.SYS), you must use version 4.33d or higher.  
Earlier versions identify the SCSI hard disk drive as a 
removable drive. This may cause problems when using File 
Manager, such as a system failure while formatting the drive 
and unexpected results when deleting files. To get an updated 
driver, contact Trantor Systems, Ltd. 

UMB PRO Version 1.07
--------------------
If you are running UMB PRO, you may experience problems
running Windows in standard mode. In some cases, your system
may fail. Make sure that you are using only one memory manager 
with Windows 3.1. It is recommended that you use HIMEM.SYS 
and EMM386.EXE, which are installed with Windows 3.1, to 
manage memory instead.  

Vaccine
-------
If Vaccine is loaded, Setup fails when trying to modify the 
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. You should unload Vaccine 
before setting up Windows 3.1. You may also encounter problems,
such as beeping, while running Windows when Vaccine is loaded.

VIREX-PC Version 1.11
---------------------
If VIREXPC.COM is loaded, Windows Setup and Windows 3.1
will fail when KRNL386.EXE performs a write operation. Also,
the first time Windows 3.1 is loaded, you may be returned
to the MS-DOS prompt.  

Virus Prevention Plus Version 5.0
---------------------------------
If Virus Prevention Plus is loaded, you may not be able to 
successfully set up Windows 3.1. You may also encounter 
problems when running Windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode. 
The Keyboard Lock program may cause Windows to fail.

Virusafe Version 4.0
--------------------
If this program is loaded as a TSR, Setup may fail while setting 
up Windows 3.1. It is recommended that you load Virusafe by using
the /C- option. This option turns off the memory-change detection
provided with Virusafe. Version 4.5 may correct this problem.  
For more information, see your Virusafe documentation.

XGAAIDOS.SYS
------------
With XGAAIDOS.SYS loaded, Windows 3.1 will fail at the opening
logo if you use the WIN /s option to start Windows in standard mode.

XMAEM.SYS
---------
XMAEM.SYS is a device which causes extended memory to act like
XMA. This utility is incompatible with Windows 3.1. It is recommended
that you remove all references to it from your CONFIG.SYS and
AUTOEXEC.BAT files before setting up or running Windows 3.1.
XMAEM.SYS is provided with IBM DOS version 4.0.

XMA2EMS.SYS
-----------
Windows will run correctly with XMA2EMS.SYS if it is loaded 
on a computer that has an XMA board installed. Otherwise, this
