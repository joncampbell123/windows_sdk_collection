Installation of Driver - The Easy Way -

    Use control panel, drivers. Add an unlisted driver from floppy.
    Choose either the DOS-Windows, or NT-Windows version.
    Choose the communications port the vcr(s) are on.
    Choose "detect" to automatically determine and configure all
       vcr(s) on the selected communications port.
    If "detect" indicates 0 VCRs then there is something wrong
        with either the VCR or the connection.  Please recheck
        all cables and then retry "detect".

    You should now be able to start mplayer.exe and find your 
    VCR in the list of available devices.


Installation of Driver - The Hard Way -

        1) Copy the files, vcr.mci and mcivisca.drv, which are on the
           floppy to your windows system directory, e.g., \win\system.
        2) Add the following line to your system.ini under the [mci] section:
           VCR=mcivisca.drv comport deviceid

    Where:
        comport  = the communications port the serial cable is in.
        deviceid = the number of the device (usually 1)

    Example:
        [mci]
        VCR=mcivisca com1 1
        VCR1=mcivisca com1 2

        The first entry indicates that "VCR" is the name used for device 
        number 1 on communications port number 1.

        The second entry indicates that "VCR1" is the name used for
        device 2 on communications port number 1.


Usage notes:
        1) Be sure to reset your camcorder hms counter at beginning of the tape;
           you will not be able to search into negative counter values.
           (either externally or with the mci-string "set vcr counter 0")

        2) Timecode may not be detectable, even though it is present,
           on some decks at the very beginning or the very end of a
           tape. If you are using mplayer, play the vcr for a few 
           seconds and then close and reopen the driver, or issue
           the "time mode detect" command.

        3) Index marking is highly hardware specific. Please refer to
           your video deck/cameras operation manual.

        4) Some vcrs cannot independently select RECORD
           tracks, e.g. video and afm track must both be off or on.
           (setvideo record, setaudio record, settimecode record).
           In order to fix this a special error is returned when
           independent record track selection is attempted with
           vcrs that cannot.  The track selection request is then 
           re-applied with the next record track selection command.

           Status commands always return the true record state of the
           track.

        5) The millisecond time format assumes 30fps (as opposed to
           29.97).  This is done for compatibility reasons.  SMPTE
           time formats use the native time format on the tape, and 
           should be used whenever possible to avoid rounding errors.

        6) Freeze compatibility with VFW 1.0 (Only with VFW 1.0)
           If you will be using a deck capable of freezing,(EVO-9650)
           and wish to do step capture with VidCap from VFW version 1.0, 
           then you should set the following flag in win.ini:

           [MCIVCR]
           FreezeOnStep=1

      f i n a l    Compilation Notes    f i n a l    

======================================================================

        This code will compile in both DOS-Windows and NT-Windows.
        
        The makefile "makefile" is used for DOS compiling.
        The makefile "makefile.nt" is used for NT compiling.

        DOS-Windows version
              This code was compiled using the Microsoft C8 compiler.

        NT-Windows verions
              This code was compiled using the Microsoft C8 compiler.

        You also must have "mmddk.h", which is included in the 
        Microsoft Device Driver Kit (DDK) for Windows and in the 
        Microsoft Device Driver Kit (NTDDK) for Windows-NT.
        
        However, for your convenience we have provided these files 
        along with the source code. You must first copy either the
        Windows or the Windows NT version of "mmddk.h" to somewhere in
        your include path before compiling.
