This sample program demonstrates writing an AVI file.  When executed, it will
create a file called OUTPUT.AVI that contains a short movie of a clock with
rotating hands and the numbers 1-15 counting on the face of the clock.  That's
all this program does.  It doesn't even have a user-interface.

WRITEAVI.C - This file is the high-level application that uses the routines
provided by AVIFILE.DLL to create the file.
