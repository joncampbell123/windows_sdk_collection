The files in this directory are used to create capture drivers 
based on the Chips and Technologies PC9001A chipset.  These include:

Truevision Bravado
Creative Labs Video Blaster


========== Modifying this sample driver ===================

1. If you avoid modifying the core message processing
   files (DRVPROC.C, VMSG.C) and isolate your changes to
   CTDEV.C, integration with future updates will be
   easier.

2. Update the VERSION, REVISION, RELEASE fields
   in SAMPLE.RCV, as appropriate, with each build.
   This will ensure our installation utilities are
   able to automatically load the newest version of your
   driver.

3. Change the VERSIONDESCRIPTION field in BRAVADO.RC
   to an appropriate name.  Also change the module 
   name in the .DEF file.

4. In addition to support for the standard DIB formats,
   the sample driver demonstrates how to save data
   in a custom format, in this case the native 
   scaled YUV format found on boards using the 
   PCVIDEO-Phillips encoder chipsets.  This capability will 
   be removed from the final shipping driver and is only 
   provided here as a demonstration.


============= Setting up drivers ===========================

The Drivers applet in the control panel cannot install
more than one driver of type MSVIDEO.  Either deinstall
an existing driver, or manually edit SYSTEM.INI. 
If you choose to manually edit SYSTEM.INI, you can 
select between any available driver at run time.

[Drivers]
msvideo=targa16.drv
msvideo1=bravado.drv
msvideo2=vblaster.drv
msvideo3=MYDRVR.DRV

Vidcap takes a command line parameter specifying the
index of the driver to use:

VIDCAP -d0         (uses targa16.drv)
VIDCAP -d1         (uses bravado.drv)
VIDCAP -d2         (uses vblaster.drv)
VIDCAP -d3         (uses MYDRVR.drv)

============== Other DLLs required ========================

Some of the MSVIDEO drivers use a vendor supplied DLL
to provide low level device control.
The appropriate DLL must be present on the path 
prior to installing or using the driver.

Driver                     Support DLL
--------                --------------------
Targa16.drv                none
Bravado.drv                VW.DLL
VBlaster.drv               PCVIDEO.DLL


====== Vidcap drivers and Installable Compressors ===========

When writing an AVI file, Vidcap honors the VIDEOHDR.dwBytesUsed 
field, and writes a RIFF chunk of this size.  The FOURCC
biCompression field of the BITMAPINFOHEADER returned
by the driver in response to a DVM_FORMAT message
is written to the AVIStreamHeader.fccHandler field in the file.

To display a compressed stream, the installable
compressor interface searches for a codec which can support
the format specified in the AVIStreamHeader.fccHandler.
Depending on the request, the codec either
just decompresses the frame, or can take responsibility
for rendering also.  This allows codecs to be written
which send the compressed image to a hardware decompressor
if one is present, and perform software conversion to a DIB
if hardware is unavailable.

Note that the APIs and Messages for Installable Compressors
and Vidcap drivers have been designed so that a single
driver can perform both capture and codec functions.
The VIDEO_OPEN_PARMS.fccType field passed when the driver is
opened contains 'vcap' if a capture channel is requested, and
contains 'vidc' when a codec is opened.
