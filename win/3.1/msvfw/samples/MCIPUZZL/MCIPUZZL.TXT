Using MCIPuzzle:

Open an AVI file using File.Open.

Choose Puzzle.Hook to install the custom draw procedure which
implements the "15" puzzle.

Click on the window to move the pieces of the puzzle around.

Puzzle.Scramble scrambles the puzzle, Puzzle.Solve solves it.





What's being demonstrated:

The program uses a new MCIAVI custom command to install a drawing
procedure.  This procedure is called by MCIAVI whenever a
decompressed frame of video needs to be drawn.

puzzproc.c contains the drawing procedure, and mciplay.c has the
commands required to install it.

puzzle.c contains the code that actually implements the "puzzle"
part, but doesn't have a whole lot to do with VfW.  The MixPuzzle()
function is, however, an example of how to arbitrarily munge DIBs.





Bugs:

Essentially, the program doesn't work right with more than one window
open: There's only one arrangement of the pieces for all open windows.
Other windows don't repaint automatically when another window is
clicked like they should.

Clicking on a window will affect the puzzle, even if that window
isn't hooked up to the draw procedure.
