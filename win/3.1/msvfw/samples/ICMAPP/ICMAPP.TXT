
ICMAPP: Sample code to compress and decompress DIBs using COMPMAN, the
	Compression Manager.

	ICM.C is not part of this application, but rather part of the source
	code for COMPMAN that demonstrates how the helper functions were
	written and how to use the ICCompress and ICDecompress functions.
