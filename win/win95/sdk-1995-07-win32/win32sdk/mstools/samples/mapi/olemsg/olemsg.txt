USER QUESTIONNAIRE
==================
Please take a moment to answer the following questions and return
your answers to "dougw@microsoft.com" or to: Microsoft OLE Messaging
Program Management, c/o Doug Wood, Microsoft Corporation,
One Microsoft Way, Redmond WA, 98052.

1.  How will you use OLE Messaging?
2.  Are you programming primarily with Visual Basic/VBA or with C/C++?
3.  Do you plan to use OLE Messaging to create custom forms?

INSTALLATION
============
Microsoft OLE Messaging Library version 1.0 is installed as part of the
Microsoft Windows 32 SDK MAPI Setup procedure. For complete information,
see your MAPI Setup documentation.

SAMPLE CODE
===========
An Excel 5.0 spreadsheet is available that contains Visual Basic
sample code for many of the OLE Messaging objects, methods, and
properties. The spreadsheet is called OLEMSG.XLS.

You should install the MAPI subsystem before you try to use the
OLE Messaging sample spreadsheet OLEMSG.XLS. The Windows 32 SDK
contains the OLE Messaging Library and other supporting files.

When you attempt to use the spreadsheet macro Session_Logon in the
Microsoft Windows 3.x environment, Microsoft Excel may display the
message, "File Error: Cannot find COMMDLG."  When you see this message,
select "Close".  This message can be ignored.

KNOWN SOFTWARE ERRORS IN MICROSOFT OLE MESSAGING LIBRARY VERSION 1.0
====================================================================
The following topics discuss known software errors:

* Item Property Required To Access Attachment From Collection

Item Property Required To Access Attachment From Collection
-----------------------------------------------------------
When you access an individual attachment from within the Attachments 
collection, you must use its Item property. When you attempt to access 
an Attachment object using the VB/VBA construct "Attachments(index)", 
you obtain the Attachments collection rather than the Attachment object. 
As a workaround, use the VB/VBA statement, "Attachments.Item(index)".

DOCUMENTATION ERRATA
====================
ConversationIndex property (Message object)
-------------------------------------------
The sample code uses the incorrect object name "objFirstMessage" rather
than "objFirstMsg" in a comment and in a statement following the comment.
This error is corrected in the Excel spreadsheet OLEMSG.XLS that
contains all sample code that appears in the documentation.

OTHER NOTES
===========
The following topics discuss other issues related to Microsoft
OLE Messaging Library version 1.0:

* Viewing Enumeration Constants
* Attempts To Access Empty Conversation Property Cause Exceptions

Viewing Enumeration Constants
-----------------------------
The 32-bit version of the type library browser OLE2VIEW.EXE 
does not display the correct values for enumeration constants. 
To view the enumeration constants for the OLE Messaging Library,
use the 16-bit version of the type library browser or use
the browser that is built into Microsoft Excel or Visual Basic.

Attempts To Access Empty Conversation Property Cause Exceptions
-----------------------------------------------------------------
When your code tries to read the Message object property 
ConversationTopic when this property is not defined for the object,
OLE Messaging raises an exception. You should add error handling
code to your VB/VBA application for this case.
