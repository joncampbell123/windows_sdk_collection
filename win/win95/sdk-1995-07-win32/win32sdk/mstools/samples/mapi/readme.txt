
In order to use these MAPI samples on Windows 95, you must install
"Microsoft Exchange" from the Windows 95 Setup program.  Note that
"Microsoft Exchange" is not installed or selected by default, so
users will have to select these components via the Custom Setup
option at the beginning of Windows 95 setup.  It can be added later
to Windows 95 by activating the "Inbox" icon on your desktop
following Windows 95 installation.

In order to use these MAPI samples on Windows NT, you must install
the MAPI subsystem for Windows NT 3.51.  This should be done by
running the setup program found in the MSTOOLS\MAPI\WINNTRT directory
on the Win32 SDK CD.

For more information on MAPI, please see MSTOOLS\MAPI\README.WRI on
the Win32 SDK CD.
