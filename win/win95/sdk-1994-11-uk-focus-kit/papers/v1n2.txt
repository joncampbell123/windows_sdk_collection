
Microsoft WinNews Electronic Newsletter, 
Vol. 1, #2, September 8, 1994
****************************************

Today at 10 AM PDT, Microsoft announced the new name for
Chicago.  Chicago will be called Windows 95. The "Designed
for Windows 95" logo program was also unveiled this morning.
The press release for this announcement is at the end of
this newsletter.

This issue highlights corporate adoption of Windows 95.  The
recent set of technical bulletins from the Gartner Group
highlighting corporate adoption strategies and costs
associated with moving to Windows 95is a MUST READ if 
you are contemplating a large scale roll-out of Windows 95.
We present highlights from those bulletins, as well as an
overview of the Windows 95 Desktop Management Interfaces.

What does it mean to be a "Designed for Windows 95" app?
A short summary is included here, and more details are
available on WinNews.

It seems that there is no end to which people will go to 
proclaim their operating systems choice.  If you are on our
WinNews servers anytime in the near future, check out the 
file WINTAT.ZIP to see what one enthusiastic 
customer did. Look for a listing of other new files on 
WinNews later in this issue as well.

GARTNER GROUP SAYS WINDOWS SHOPS SHOULD PLAN TO MIGRATE TO
WINDOWS 95.

Two new research reports from the Gartner Group highlight IS
migration to Windows 95, and the real cost of ownership of 
Windows 95.

In "GUI Operating System Migration: How Sticky Will It Be" 
the author presents a plan to minimize the cost
of migration using Just-In-Time-Training (JITT) and automated
installation and distribution.  Gartner highlights that
substantial cost reductions are possible with advanced planning
and estimates that it is possible to reduce the cost of
migration to just $205.99 per seat.

In "Personal Computing Costs: A Chicago Model"
Gartner estimates that a typical organization will pay back
the cost of migrating to Windows 95 in three to six months.
The author cites factors such as the Windows 95 Registry, Plug 
and Play, DMI and SNMP agents in estimating that Windows 95 asset
management costs will be as much as 19% lower than Windows
3.x.  Gartner also estimates technical support costs at 12%
lower than Windows 3.x,  and end user operations at 18% lower
than Windows 3.x.

Windows 95 Desktop Management

The largest cost associated with corporate PC ownership is not
the cost of acquiring the hardware and software.  Rather, it is
the cost of ongoing maintenance, and management of these assets
once they're in place.  Windows 95 Desktop Management capabilities
are an effective way to reduce that expense.

The key to desktop management with Windows 95 is the registry. The
desktop management components of the registry are two binary, hidden
files, called SYSTEM.DAT and USER.DAT.  As the names imply, these
files separate the management of the PC into basically two areas:
user-specific settings and system-specific settings.

User Profiles allow roaming users to get their own PC system settings
wherever they log in on the network.  And multiple users who use
the same machine get their own settings when they log on as well.

Each user profile is stored in a hidden subdirectory on the PC,
and maintained automatically by Windows 95.  User profiles can also
be stored on the network and automatically synched with the local
profile at login time.

System Policies, in contrast to user profiles, allow the system
administrator to centrally mandate user and machine specific
settings.  For instance, particular users might be prevented from
accessing the command line prompt, or the administrator might
mandate that user level security be used on machines with sensitive
data rather than share level security.

Systems policies are editable using the Windows 95 System Policy
Editor.  Policies can be specified by user and/or machine, and
default policies can be set so that the administrator need not
supply policies explicitly for every user.

Windows 95 also contains several admin tools which can be used by the
system administrator either locally or remotely:

	* a systems performance monitor
	* a net-watcher applet to monitor peer sharing
	* a remote file system administration tool
	* an SNMP agent to allow SNMP consoles to monitor
	  Chicago systems
	* a DMI (Desktop Management Interface) service layer

More information on systems management using Windows 95 is available
on WinNews in the Chi_MGMT.ZIP file.

So what is a "Designed for Windows 95" App?

Microsoft has a Windows logo program that has evolved over time 
to keep in step with new technology. Applications meeting certain 
requirements can currently qualify to display the "Windows Compatible" 
mark on their product and in advertisements.

The Windows Compatible logo is used to show not only a product's 
compatibility with Windows, but also to indicate that it has been 
developed specifically to take advantage of the Windows family of 
operating systems.

When vendors use the Windows logo, they help make it easier for 
customers to spot and buy products developed and built for both 
the Windows and Windows NT operating systems.

As you might expect, when a new version of Windows ships, a new
logoing program is introduced. 

So what will qualify an application as "Designed for Windows 95"?
To qualify for the new Windows logo an application must meet seven 
requirements. The first four requirements 
apply to all applications.

1.	An application must be a Win32 executable.
2.	An app needs UI/shell support, following the User Interface 
	Design Guide. Among other things this means it must:
	*	Use the Chicago "look," as described in the UI 
		Design Guide 4.0. Using system-supplied common 
		dialogs and controls is also highly recommended.
	*	Use the right mouse button for context menus (and not 
		use the right mouse button for anything else). This is 
		recommended, but not required.
	*	Follow Chicago application setup guidelines to make the
		app properly visible in the shell. At a minimum, this 
		means that the application must use the registry, not 
		add information to WIN.INI or SYSTEM.INI, and provide 
		complete uninstall capability.
3.	It must run successfully on Windows NT 3.5. If it uses 
	Chicago-only application programming interfaces (APIs), the 
	Chicago-only functionality must degrade gracefully on Windows 
	NT 3.5.
4.	It must use long filenames.

The next three requirements apply to those applications that deal 
with files (those that provide Open and Close options on the File menu). 
For example, a multimedia title such as Microsoft Encarta or a game 
such as Microsoft Golf or Doom would not need to follow these three 
requirements.

5.	It must support universal naming convention (UNC) path names.
6.	It must have OLE 2.0 container and/or object support and 
	OLE 2.0 drag-and-drop support. 
7.	It needs to support simple mail enabling. That is, it must 
        include a Send or Send Mail command on the File menu.

For Release 10 a.m. PDT
Sept. 8, 1994

Windows 95 Announced As Official Name 
For Microsoft Windows "Chicago" 

New Windows 95 Logo Program Represents Software, 
Peripherals and PCs Designed for Windows 95

	REDMOND, Wash. -- Sept. 8, 1994 -- Microsoft 
Corporation today announced Windows(tm) 95 as the official 
name for the next major release of the Microsoft(r) 
Windows(tm) operating system, previously known by its code 
name, "Chicago."  The name Windows 95 was chosen to 
make it easier for consumers to identify the most current 
version of Microsoft Windows.  Windows 95 was designed 
for a wide range of users, from the novice to the expert, to 
help make everyday personal computing even easier than 
before.  The name Windows 95 represents the broad scope 
of today's users of Windows and the new generation of 
software and hardware it enables.

	 "We're seeing a new kind of consumer for personal 
computer products," said Doug Schutt, senior vice 
president at Price Costco.  "No longer is it just the power 
user who shops for software, hardware or even multimedia 
CDs, but rather a variety of customers:  families, kids, 
students and power users.  Windows 95 will make it easier 
for our consumers to identify the most current version of 
Windows."

	"More than 60 million copies of Windows have been 
shipped to date," said Paul Maritz, senior vice president, 
systems and technology division at Microsoft.  "From 
extensive research worldwide, we have found that most 
users find our existing version numbering confusing and 
can't identify the latest version of Windows.  Our customers 
want products that simplify their everyday computing, and 
our goal is to have both the technology and the name meet 
that requirement."

	Windows 95, targeted for release in the first half of 
1995, is designed to make PCs even easier to use while 
delivering more performance.  Windows 95 is a fully 
integrated 32-bit operating system, replacing Windows 
3.11, Windows(tm) for Workgroups 3.11 and the MS-DOS(r) 
operating system as the mainstream desktop operating 
system.  Windows 95 supports features such as long file 
names and a revised user-interface design based on 
extensive customer usability studies.  Windows 95 will run 
multiple applications faster, more effectively, and with 
greater safety than it can today.  It is completely compatible 
with the products people use today and an even better 
platform for the next generation of applications, games, PCs 
and peripherals that Windows 95 enables. 

	Windows 95 is targeted for users performing a 
variety of tasks, from customers who have home computers 
for running recreational and education applications to those 
who want to run business and productivity applications and 
those who want to work remotely from home.
Windows 95 Logo Program

	Microsoft also officially announced today the 
Windows 95 logo program, including the new "Designed 
for Microsoft Windows 95" logo.  The logo is intended to 
help users easily identify software, hardware and peripherals 
that exploit the rich capabilities of the new operating 
system.  Examples of these new capabilities are Plug and 
Play and support for 32-bit applications.  While the logo 
denotes products specifically designed for Windows 95,  it 
is optional.  Existing products for Windows or new 
products that are not designed specifically for Windows 95 
can still be designated as "Windows compatible."

	"Much of the industry is working very hard and very 
creatively to develop products that are not just compatible 
with Windows but are designed for Windows 95," said Brad 
Chase, general manager of the personal systems division at 
Microsoft.  "Our mission is to help users identify these great 
new products and understand these products will be a step 
beyond what they are familiar with today."  

	"With the new Microsoft Windows 95 logo 
program, our customers will be able quickly and easily to 
identify hardware such as peripherals, and desktop PCs and 
mobile PCs that we've designed specifically for Windows 
95," said Richard C. Watts, vice president and general 
manager of the personal information products group at 
Hewlett-Packard Company.  "Our customers want products 
that are designed and tested for Windows 95."

	"The Windows 95 logo will signal to customers that 
our products take full advantage of Windows 95," said 
Bruce Brereton, vice president of development at the Novell 
applications group at WordPerfect Corporation.  "We 
expect the logo to be an important way to emphasize our 
new products designed specifically for Windows 95."

	"We have been working with Microsoft throughout 
the design and development of our new series of ATAPI 
Interface CD-ROM drives that will display the Windows 95 
logo," said Patty Kim, senior marketing manager of data 
storage products/CD-ROM at Sony.  "Our goal is to drive 
cutting-edge technology through standards required to 
deliver Plug and Play solutions to the end-user market.  
Plug and Play ensures seamless integration of computer 
peripherals into AT(r) architectures, in addition to higher 
performance enabled by Windows 95."

	The new Windows 95 logo will represent a single, 
unified program that is intended to replace the current 
Windows logo programs.  Licensing of the new logo is 
scheduled to begin at the end of 1994.  Developers can 
obtain more information on the new logo program by 
contacting the Microsoft Developer Solutions phone and 
fax service at (206) 635-2222.

	Founded in 1975, Microsoft (NASDAQ "MSFT") is 
the worldwide leader in software for personal computers.  
The company offers a wide range of products and services 
for business and personal use, each designed with the 
mission of making it easier and more enjoyable for people to 
take advantage of the full power of personal computing 
every day.
