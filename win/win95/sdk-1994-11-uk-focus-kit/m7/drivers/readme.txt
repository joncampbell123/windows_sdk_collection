The \Drivers directory contains additional device 
drivers for use with Chicago.  

Some of these files are preliminary, and have not yet 
received as much testing as the files in the \Retail 
directory.  They are provided now for early beta testing.  

Some of the drivers, e.g. 8514, will become a part of the 
Windows Driver Library (WDL), rather than be included in 
the final retail release.

See the README.TXT files in the various directories for
explanations of their contents and instructions for
installation.

Microsoft appreciates your assistance testing these files.
Please submit bug reports about them using the usual
reporting procedures.  However, please note in your reports
when you are beta testing using any of the files contained
in the \Drivers directory.

Thanks!
The Chicago Team
