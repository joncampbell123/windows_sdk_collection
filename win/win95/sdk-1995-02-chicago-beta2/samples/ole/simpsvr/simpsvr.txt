file simpsvr.txt -this file is zipped in with simpsvr.zip. This is the
simpsvr/Simple Server OLE2 SDK sample program ported to work with
Chicago ANSI-only functions, and OLE2 UNICODE-only functions. All the files
used by the build are here, even the ones I didn't change. It builds under
Daytona 585, DEBUG=1 and DEBUG=0 without errors or warnings.

Due to a bug in OLE2UI, you must delete the
SIMPSVR\protocol\StdfileEditing\server entry from the Reg DB to make
simpsvr's user-class-name appear in the Insert Object dialog of Simpcntr or 
Simpdnd.
 
Build instructions:

You must have the Daytona 585 includes and libs first in your include and lib
environment variables, and preferably nothing else. 

To build from the command prompt, cd to the simpsvr directory.
To do a WIN32 debug build,     nmake /a 
To do a WIN32 non-debug build, nmake /a DEBUG=0
