These are samples which use some basic Win32 API.  To build each
of the samples follow these steps.

1) Make sure your environment points to the 32bit targetting libs,
includes, and tools binaries (this can be done by running the
sdkenv.bat generated by install.bat).

2) cd to <project dir >

3) nmake -f <projectdir>.mak  some of the samples make use of
DLLs.  In these cases it may be necessary to build the DLL first,
which will produce an import library. (e.g. mltithrd - first
build tlsdll).


4) To build .sym files for 32 bit exe's, use mapsympe.  This has
not been integrated into the makefile process.

5) To build "release" version of samples (change in optimization
and no debug info) use DEBUG=0 on the nmake command line.  For
example:

    nmake DEBUG=0 notepad.mak

6) Currently, this release of the samples includes kernel32.lib
on the LFLAGS line.  This is not necessary for your own makefiles
since the C runtime libs have directives for including KERNEL32.LIB
