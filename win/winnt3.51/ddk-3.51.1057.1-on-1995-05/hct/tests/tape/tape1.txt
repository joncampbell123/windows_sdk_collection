Uses the Windows NT Tape Backup applicaton in an
automated fashion to test the tape adapter and
driver combination.

The following parameters are required:

Data Drive\Path  [default c:]

MB To Use on Data Drive [default 50]

Optional Parameters:

Addit. Backup DrvX [default c:]

In the default case, the test will create data on
the Data Drive\Path that fills up 50 MB on the Data
Drive. The Path is limited to one level deep.  The
test will then backup the data, restore, and compare
using checksums.

'MB to use on the data drive' refers to the SIZE of
the tree that will be created/backed up/restored and
verified.

'Addit. Backup DrvX' allows Backup with Verify of up 
to three additional drives without Restore.
