Resview test automation.
1) To start the test type:
	srt
2) 2 different log files are created:
	rt.log  
        temp?.scn

3)Pass/Fail Detection.
	If there is no substring of "FAIL" in the whole log file (rt.log).

4) What to do if test fails.
  This test creates a temporary screen file which contains every screen tested. This file
is named  temp?.scn , where '?' is a number.   The highest number is the last test run. 
  You can view these screen files with 'vtscreen.exe'. 

NOTE: 
a:If you are calling this test manually with srt.bat the temp?.scn files are never deleted and the test will 
create a new one with the next highest available number. If this is done many times , the files must be manually
deleted. If you schedule this test with svt.bat (video testing) they are all deleted automatically.

b: This test compares the current screens to the screens stored in rt.scn to determine if the current screen 
is correct. If , for any reason, this file needs to be created again  , use a /c switch with srt.bat. 
Then look at all the screens in that file with 'vtscreen.exe' to determine that they are all okay. Then run the 
test again without the /c switch.
