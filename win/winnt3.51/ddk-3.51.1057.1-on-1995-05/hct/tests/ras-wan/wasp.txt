WASP -- Winsock Asynchronous Stress Program, Version 540
Usage:
	wasp -<tcp|udp|spx|ipx|tp4> -<c|s> [-d] [-a srv addr] [options]
		   Must specify a single transport.

		-c -- Client test
		-s -- Server test
		   Must specify one and only one of c or s

		-a <server Address> (for client tests only!)
		   Give in dotted decimal notation for TCP/UDP, 
		   default 127.0.0.1.
		   Give card address for IPX/SPX, no default.
		   Give nsap string for ISO/TP4, no default.
		
		-al <Local Address> -- local address string.
		   Required only for transports (e.g. ISO) that 
		   require local address to bind.  Optional on 
	           other transports.
		
		-an <server Network Address> -- server network 
		   address string. Optionally specify non-local 
	           network address, on transports (e.g. IPX) that 
		   have a separate network address.
		
		-m -- Message based sockets
		   Only for stream protocols which support message sockets

		-ol<logfile> -- write output to Logfile
		-od -- Debug output
		-op -- Popup errors
		-os -- output to Screen (instead of status line)
		-on -- No log output

		-select -- Test using select() call

		-t <number> -- Number of threads to run
		   Defaults:
		      - STREAM server - 4
		      - STREAM client - 2
		      - DGRAM server - 4
		      - DGRAM client - 2

		-ps <number> -- Server Ports (server only)
		   - stream server
		       Number of ports to stress.  Default 4.
		   - dgram server
		       Unused, each UDP server thread, takes a port.
		       Specify number of ports by selecting number of threads.
		   - clients
		       If unspecified client assumes server is default 
		       number of ports
		       If server is running on more ports -- whether 
		       from addtitional threads or additional processes, 
		       specify the total.
		       Note, incorrect values are not fatal, the client 
		       will merely try to connect to server ports that 
		       are inactive.

		-pf <port> -- First server Port
		   - servers - Use when dispatching the same test multiple 
		       times If, clients are going to bang on ports from 
		       several server processes, choose this value on 
		       multiple server instances so that range of ports 
		       is contiguous.
		   - clients - Use when want to stress an instance of 
		       server, not on default port (perhaps because first 
		       server instance hung).

		-v -- MS DOS clients (server option only)
\n		-r -- Rubber test (STREAM only), accept/connect, but send 
		       no data

		-e -- Echo test (DGRAM only), server just echoes client 
		       dgrams
		-er<number> -- Echo Retry limit, before ignoring writes.

		-b -- cancel-Blocking call test
		      Run cancel blocking call along with regular test

		-fb<number> -- total fast Bytes sent262144
		      WARNING:  must be the same in server and clients or 
		      test gags
		-fs<number> -- fixed send length in fast send (default is 
		      variable length)
		-fr<number> -- fixed recv length in fast recv (default is 
		      variable length)
		      NOTE:  no space between option flag and number

		-hr<number> -- cHat Retry limit, before ignoring writes.
		-hb -- use Big cHat buffers

		-i 000d[:00h[:00m]] -- test run tIme

		-z -- start with minimiZed window.

		-l -- sLeep when clients don't get response from server
		-lm <number> -- set sleep Magnitude
		-lx <number> -- set eXponent on max sleep backoff
		    Control the exp backoff time on re-connectivity from 
		    client to server. The formulas is (time()+socket_id);  
		    (exp(number)*60+rand())*1000;.

		-q <number> -- listen Queue length limit (STREAM only), 
		    default 5
