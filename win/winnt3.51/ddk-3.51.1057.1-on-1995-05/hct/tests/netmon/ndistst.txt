				 Network Monitor
        	                  IMPORTANT !!
                	  THESE ARE RECOMMENDATION뭆 ONLY
*******************************************************************************

The files in the \BHTEST directory are designed to do two things. 
1. Ensure that your driver is compatible with Netmon running.
2. Make available to you  a good troubleshooting tool.



Recommended hardware
 1 486/66, EISA/ISA/MCA, 16meg, running Daytona.
 1 486/66 or better, EISA/ISA/MCA, 32meg, running Daytona.
 1 386/33 or better, must be capable of running a server and have two net cards.
Note that we might want the test control machine to be an NT box so that it can do the debug setup.
 2 microhubs
 1 token ring (and all hardware)
 1 FDDI ring (and all hardware)
 enough microhub cabling to populate 6+ connections

Loop on Bloodhound machine:
	check test control for a stop
	setup Bloodhound (capture filters, buffers, close all views etc.)
	start capturing
	tell test control to start the test
	capture packets until test control says that the transmit is done.
	count packets
	log results (number of packets, number dropped, bandwidth, etc...)
	loop

Loop on Traffic Generator machine:
	check test control for a stop
	Loop looking for test control to start test
	setup test parameters (packet size, inter-packet gap etc...)
	start traffic generator
	wait for traffic generator to finish
	notify test control that the test is complete.
	Loop.

Running the tests

*******************************************************************************
1. This test were written in MSTest Ver. 3.0 ( this version will run on all platforms. ie x86, Mips, Alpha)
2. This test also assumes that you have the NT DDK installed (TPCTL IS USED)
3. Since there is such a wide varity of machines that this test can run on EACH test bed MUST be Calibrated !
4. The machine names refered to coincide with NET.BMP




A)	BHCTL.TXT:
*******************************************************************************

BHPath=c:\nm\netmon.exe
	This is where NetMon is located on BH MASTER

TestControl=bh_server
	This is the Name of the SERVER	

ControlShare=BHTest
	This is the SHAREPOINT on the SERVER

TestShare=BHTest
	This is the SHAREPOINT where the Sync file will be written

LogDir=BHTest.log
	This is the log fiel will be written on the \\SERVER\SHAREPOINT! BHTEST\Logname.csv

Media=Token Ring 16Mbps
	This is your Media Discription

Card=Compaq Netflex
	This will end up in the LogFile

Logname=Netflext.CSV
	This is the LogFile Name

*******************************************************************************







B)	BHCTL.MST
*******************************************************************************

This file is a MSTest Script that controls BH MASTER
This machine MUST HAVE NetMon installed AND have the card being test as LANA 0
You can edit part if this file to customize it for you. it is fairly well commented
and can be opened with just about any editor ( notepad can be used ) 




C)	BHSLV.MST
*******************************************************************************

This file is the MSTest Script that runs on BH SLAVE
This machine MUST have th DDK installed and TPCTL installed and working.
You can edit part if this file to customize it for you. it is fairly well commented
and can be opened with just about any editor ( notepad can be used ) 




D)	TABLEGEN.BAT
*******************************************************************************

This File is the Calibration File and should be on the BH SLAVE machine.
This is where you calibrate TPCTL (The Send time Delta between frames).
You can use a Sniffer or you can us NetMon to calibrate the traffic on the wire.
