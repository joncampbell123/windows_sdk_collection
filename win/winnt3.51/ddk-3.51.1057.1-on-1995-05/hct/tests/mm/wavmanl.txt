; This data file is meant to act as a sanity check for the MCI WaveAudio
; driver. It attempts to run a representative set of commands on known
; audio files, and asks the user whether or not the results were as expected.
; It is IMPERATIVE that all questions be phrased in a manner such as 'Yes'
; indicates the correct behaviour, and 'No' indicates an error.
;
; Rules for construction of this data file can be found in MCI\MCIGen\TestLoop.
