This is a little more interesting than HELLO.  This program uses a
menu and GDI, and not only that, it sets the mapping mode and some
other DC facts to nondefault values.

Mention the use of menus, and the use of the shapes.h file to use the
same symbolic names in the C file and the RC file that is used to
create the menu.

Mention the use of Anisotropic mapping mode, which is the key to this
hack and the drawing part of TRACK.

The other interesting variety in this is the several ways in which the
shapes are specified.  The triangle uses MoveTo and LineTo, while the
Star is specified with a static array of points that is passed to a
Polyline call.  The Rectangle and the Ellipse are done through GDI
simulations.

The other important thing about this is that it illustrates the use
of the paint request mechanism--the InvalidateRect call at the end of
the ShapesCommand routine.  The the NULL second parameter, which is
normally an LPRECT that indicates the area to be repainted indicates
the entire client rect should be repainted, and the TRUE third
parameter indicate that the rect should be painted with the
background brush before the appropriate paint proc is called.  The
ValidateRect call at the end of the ShapesPaint proc uses a similar
NULL LPRECT to indicate that the entire client area is painted.
