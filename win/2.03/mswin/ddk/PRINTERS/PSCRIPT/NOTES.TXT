The following changes were made to the source after we recieved
them from Aldus:


1. The entire ColorInfo routine in graph.c was changed so that
   it maps input color values into black or white.


2. The code which handles PatBlts in bitblt.c was fixed so that
   it no longer subtracted 1 from the rectangle's coordinates.

   There is also a corresponding fix that went into the
   psprep.txt which converts the user space coordinates of the
   rectangle into device space, subtracts one and then
   converts back to user space.

3. Updated the memory allocation flags in windows.h

4. Changed the allocation flags on the font dictionary to
   allocate it below the line, fixed, and sharable.

5. Added the -e flag to the rc compiler line so that allocations
   are done above the line by default.

6. Changed etmUppercaseDecent to etmLowerCaseDescent in pscript.h

7. Added a definition for DEFAULTRESOLUTION in printers.h so that
   when you first install the PostScript driver the dialog will
   come up with the resolution set to 300 dpi.

8. In profile.c DEFRES was changed to DEFAULTRESOLUTION so that
   the first time the driver is used, it will default to 300 dpi.

9. Added accelerators to the printer setup dialog.

10. Fixed the opaqueing box code so that it allowed room
    for the accent marks.

11. Fixed enum.c so that the font scaling code scales the width
    for the average character width instead of the max character
    width.


12. Changed bitblt.c so that the parameters to the PostScript
    "Box" macro are now Box(x, y, width, height).


13. Changed psprep.txt so that the Box macro aligns itself with
    a pixel boundary and changed its parameters so that the
    box is specified by the TopLeft coordinates and the width
    and height.

    This change was put in so that the box width would not vary
    due to roundoff errors related to the box's position on the
    page.



14. Fixed the underline and stroke macros so that they did a
    newpath before drawing the line.  This prevented them
    from drawing the clipping box that was left over in the
    path.

15. BitBlt.c used to fail to deallocate memory in the case that
    dmBitBlt failed and the code did an early return before
    reaching the end of the function.  This problem has been
    fixed.


16. Fixed GDIPolyLine in psprep.txt so that it offsets the
    pen location by 0.5 to account for the pen hang.


17. Fixed a problem where the GETEXTENTTABLE escape returned
    the scaled average character width for fixed pitch fonts
    instead of correctly returning the unscaled average character
    width.  This was done by adding an extra field to the
    FX structure in pscript.h, copying the dfAvgCharWidth into
    it when the font was loaded in enum.c and using this field
    in exttext.c
