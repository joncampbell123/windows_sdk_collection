Steps to building non-display device drivers and winoldapp grabbers.

1.  Xcopy the diskettes to the hard disk (disk1, disk2 ... disk8
subdirectories).

2.  Set the path environment variable to point to the DDK tools directory
(\disk1\utils\buildbin) first.	Alternatively copy all the files in
\disk1\utils\buildbin to the first search directory in the existing path.

3. Set the include environment variable to point to \disk6\grabbers\grabinc
first or copy all the files from \disk6\grabbers\grabinc to the existing
include directory.

4.  Set the lib environment variable to point to \disk1\lib then
\disk7\printers\lib or copy all the files from \disk1\lib and
\disk7\printers\lib to the existing lib directory.

5.  Make the various grabbers by changing to the respective directories and
running the make file or batch file.

     5.1  In the case of the cga and hercules run the appropriate batch file
     then delete all the obj's (del *.obj) and run then other batchfile.

6.  Make the keyboard, plotter, sound, mouse and comm drivers by changing to
the appropriate directory and running the resident make file.  As a rule make
files do not have a file name extension so they are easy to identify by doing
a "dir *." command.

7.  Build the printer drivers.

    7.1  Build the Epson and Laserjet drivers by changing to the appropriate
    directory and running the makefile found there.

    7.2  Build the PostScript driver by changing to \disk8\printers\pscript
    directory, copying all the files from \disk7\printers\pscript and running
    the batch file, makeit.bat.


8.  Notes:

    8.1  There are "readme" files throughout the kit and further
    documentation in the various make files and batch files.  Whenever you
    have a problem building a driver refer to these files for build details.

    8.2  You must be sure that the tools, include and library files in the
    kit have priority when you set up the "path", "include" and "lib"
    enviroment variables.
