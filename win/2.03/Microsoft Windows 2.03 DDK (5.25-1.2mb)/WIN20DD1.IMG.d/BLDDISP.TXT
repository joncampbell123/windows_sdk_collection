Steps to building display device drivers:

1.  Xcopy the diskettes to the hard disk (disk1, disk2 ... disk8
subdirectories).

2.  Set the path environment variable to point to the DDK tools directory
(disk1\utils\buildbin) first. Alternatively copy all the files in
disk1\utils\ buildbin to the first search directory in the existing path.

3. Set the include environment variable to point to disk1\masmincl first or
copy all the files from disk1\ masmincl to the existing include directory.

4.  Set the lib environment variable to point to disk1\lib first or copy all
the files from disk1\lib to the existing lib directory.

5.  Make the resource files for the various drivers.

    5.1  Make the 1024x768 resource file, 1024x767.res.

	5.1.1  Cd \disk2\resource\1024x768.
	5.1.2  Make 1024x768.

    5.2  Make the cga resource file, cga.res and the hercules resource file
	 hercules.res
	 4.2.1	Cd disk2\resource\cga
	 4.2.2	Make cga.

    4.3  Make the ega, hercules and vga resource file similarly.

6.  Build the cga and hercules drivers (cga.drv and hercules.drv).

    6.1  Cd \disk3\driver.
    6.2  Copy \disk2\resource\cga\cga.res.
    6.3  Copy \disk2\resource\hercules\hercules.res
    6.4  Makecga (This is a batch file which produces the file cga.drv)
    6.5  Del *.obj (You must delete the object files from that were created
    by the previous step).
    6.6  Makeherc (This is a batch file which produces the file hercules.drv).


7.  Build the ega mono driver (egahibw.drv).

    7.1  Cd \disk4\driver.
    7.2  Copy \disk2\resource\ega\egahibw.res.
    7.3  Make egamono.

8.  Build the ega and vga high resolution color drivers.

    8.1  Cd \disk5\driver
    8.2  Copy \disk2\resource\ega\egahires.res.
    8.2  Copy \disk2\resource\vga\vgahires.res.
    8.3  Make egahivga (produces both drivers, egahires.drv and vga.drv).

9.  Notes:

    9.1  There are "readme" files throughout the kit and further
    documentation in the various make files and batch files.  Whenever you
    have a problem building a driver refer to these files for build details.

    9.2  You must be sure that the tools, include and library files in the
    kit have priority when you set up the "path", "include" and "lib"
    enviroment variables.
