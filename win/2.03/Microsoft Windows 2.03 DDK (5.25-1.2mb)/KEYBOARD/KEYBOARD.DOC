 Differences between original and Windows keyboard drivers
----------------------------------------------------------
  We will describe here the differences between the standard DOS
keyboard device driver used in the different countries and the
Windows keyboard driver used in the same country.

1). Any country
---------------
  The Windows keyboard driver is returning ANSI 8 bits codes instead
of IBM character set code. That makes no difference for the 1rst half
of the character set (from 0 to 128 decimal) but the 2nd half is
totally different. Control codes are also get differently, whatever
is the key position on the keyboard you will get the code by hitting
simultaneously Ctrl and the corresponding sign or letter (ie Ctrl+ 'M' =
13, Ctrl+ '_' = 31).

2). U.S.A., U.K. keyboard drivers
---------------------------------
  Except the items above no known differences.

3). Italy keyboard driver
-------------------------
  The Control+ Alt+ Shift is supported allowing access to the shifted
keys of the U.S. keyboard, so we can get these additionnal signs: {}|
that are the shifted keys corresponding to: []\.
  The Ctrl+ Alt+ F1 and Ctrl+ Alt+ F2 are not supported.

4). France, Spain keyboard drivers
----------------------------------
  The Ctrl+ Alt+ Shift is also supported allowing access to the shifted
keys of the U.S. keyboard, so we can get these additionnal signs: {}|
that are the shifted keys corresponding to: []\. This combination give
the same result than Ctrl+ Alt when there is only one sign on the keycap,
eg: number + sign.
  The Ctrl+ Alt+ F1 and Ctrl+ Alt+ F2 are not supported.
  The dead keys function allows more characters, as the Ansi 8 bits is
more extended than the IBM character set. For example we support E grave
uppercase that doesn't exist in the IBM character set.
  As any accentuated character exits also in uppercase in Ansi, the Caps
Lock function is extended.
  The dead keys followed by Space bar give the accent alone, whatever this
accent is. The reason is: in Ansi character set every accent has is own
code, including the umlaut. It means also that the close quote is different
from the acute accent.

5). German keyboard driver
--------------------------
  Same as 3.3 except:
   As in the german keyboard driver the only way to get the close quote is
to enter dead key and Space bar we keep this facility and the acute accent
can be got by hitting the sequence:
  Dead key, any character, Backspace.

6). Sweden/Finland, Norway, Denmark keyboard drivers
----------------------------------------------------
  The Alt and Alt+ Shift functions have been replaced by Ctrl+ Alt and
 Ctrl+ Alt+ Shift functions. By else same as 3.3.

7). RT keyboards
----------------
  There is no known deviations for these keyboards. It should be noticed
than their Ctrl+Alt feature are more extended and French and German RT
keyboards work in ShiftLock Mode rather than CapsLock.
