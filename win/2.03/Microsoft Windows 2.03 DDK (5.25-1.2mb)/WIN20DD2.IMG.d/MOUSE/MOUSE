#   Microsoft Mouse Driver
#
#   Requirements:
#
#       MASM 5.00 or greater with the environment variable INCLUDE set to
#       the directories containing CMACROS.INC, and WINDEFS.INC etc.

#   Options:
#
#	The command line may define options to MASM by defining the OPT
#	macro.	By defining the OPT parameter in the make file, any
#	possible interaction with an environment definition is avoided.

    OPT =				    #NOP the options feature


#   Define the default assemble command.  This command could actually
#   be overridden from the command line, but shouldn't be.

    ASM = masm -z-t-n-b63 -ML  $(OPT)


#   Define the default inference rules
