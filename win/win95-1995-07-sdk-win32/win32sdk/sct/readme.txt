NOTE: This directory contains the Software Compatibility Tests for
16-bit applications on Windows NT.  For the Windows 95 System 
Compatibility tests, please see the Windows 95 DDK.
*****************

Two batch files are included to help you manage the 16-bit debugging
utilities:

remdebug.bat - removes the debug, or checked, version of the 16-bit
subsystems.  You should run this before doing any performance 
measurements.

setdebug.bat - installs the debug version of the 16-bit subsystems.

See the Software Compatibility Test documentation for more details.
