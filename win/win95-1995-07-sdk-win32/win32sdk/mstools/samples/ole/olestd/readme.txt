                         OLE Standard Utility Library

The code found in this directory builds a sample library of utility functions
which you may find helpful to use as a model for writing your own code.

Most of this code was once part of the OLE2UI sample library that used to make
up part of the OLE SDK samples.  Since OLEDLG.DLL was added to the set of
system-supported OLE libraries, much of the old OLE2UI code has become
obsolete.  This library contains most of the remaining functionality from that
DLL.

THIS LIBRARY IS NOT AN OFFICIAL PART OF THE OLE SPECIFICATION.  It is intended
only to demonstrate techniques and methods; it is not intended to be used as a
professional development library.  Microsoft cannot guarantee that all of this
code is completely correct or fully operational.

You may feel free to incorporate some of this code in your applications but
please be aware that it has undergone limited testing and may not be entirely
bug free.
