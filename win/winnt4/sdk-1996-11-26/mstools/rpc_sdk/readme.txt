1. In order to use the Mac SDK components you need the following:
    a. Microsoft Visual C++ with the Mac cross development toolkit.
    b. Win32 SDK.
2. By default, the RPC_SDK setup also installs the win16 and DOS SDK files.
   These files are not needed for you to do Mac RPC development.
3. Please refer to the section titled "Writing Macintosh Client Applications"
   in the RPC help file for more information.
