Routine Description:
   This function sets binary values (buttons) in the report.  Given an
   initialized packet of correct length, it modifies the report packet so that
   each element in the given list of usages has been set in the report packet.
   For example, in an output report with 5 LED뭩, each with a given usage,
   an application could turn on any subset of these lights by placing their
   usages in any order into the byte array (usageList).  HidP_SetUsage would,
   in turn, set the appropriate bit or add the corresponding byte into the
   HID Main Array Item.

   A properly initialized Report packet is one of the correct byte length,
   and all zeros.

Parameters:
   ReportType One of HidP_Output or HidP_Feature.

   UsagePage  All of the usages in the usage array, which HidP_SetUsage will
              set in the report, refer to this same usage page.
              If the client wishes to set usages in a packet for multiple
              usage pages then that client needs to make subsequent SetUsages
              calls.

   UsageList  A byte array containing the usages that HidP_SetUsage will set in
              the report packet.

   UsageLength The length of the given byte array.
               The parser sets this value to position in the usage array at
               which it stoped processing.  In the successful case UsageList
               will be the same as the value passed in.  In any error condition
               this field reflect how many of the usages in the usage list have
               actually been set by the parser.  This is useful for finding
               the usage in the list which caused the error.  However, in
               the event of an error condition, the report packet itself is in
               an unknown state.

   PreparsedData the preparsed data recevied from the HidClass device object.

   Report      The report packet.

   ReportLength   Length of the given report packet.


Return Value
HidP_SetUsage returns the following error codes.  Upon an error the report
packet is in an unknown state.

 STATUS_SUCCESS upon successful insertion of usages into the report packet.
 STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER_1 if reportType is not valid.
 STATUS_COULD_NOT_INTERPRET if there exists a byte in the usage list for which
                             there is no corresponding control.
 STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER_7 if the length of the report packet is not the
                             size expected.
 STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL if there are not enough entries in a given Main Array
                          Item to list all of the given usages.  The user needs
                          to split his request to set usages up.

Routine Description:
This function returns the binary values (buttons) in a HID report.

   ReportType One of HidP_Output or HidP_Feature.

   UsagePage  All of the usages in the usage array, which HidP_SetUsage will
              retrieve in the report, refer to this same usage page.

              usage pages then that client needs to make subsequent getUsages

   UsageList  A byte array containing the usages that HidP_GetUsage found in
              the report packet.

   UsageLength The length of the given byte array.
               This value initially describes the length of the usage list,
               but HidP_GetUsage sets this value to the length of found usages.

Return Value
HidpGetUsage returns the following error codes:
 STATUS_SUCCESS.
 STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER_1 if reportType is not valid.
 STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER_2 if no control for this device matches the given
                             usagePage.
 STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL if the given usageList is not long enough to hold the
                          usages found in the given report packet.
