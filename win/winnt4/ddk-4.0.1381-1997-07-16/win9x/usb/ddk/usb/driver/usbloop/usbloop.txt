What is USBLOOP?
----------------
USBLOOP is a PnP USB client driver that will load automatically
if the Intel 82930 eval board is connected to the bus. 

Using USBLOOP
-------------
It is possible to use USBLOOP with your USB device. Look at
the inf file c:\windows\inf\nodriver.inf, and add the class\subclass
value for your device from the Interface Descriptor and reboot.

There is also an app, called WinUTB.exe which will allow
you to open a device instance for your device, get the device and 
config descriptors for it, and do loopback for it. The 82930
has loopback capabilities. The app will prompt you for data
to do loopback and the spew data to the screen.
