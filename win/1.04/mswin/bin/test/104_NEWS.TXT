
Almost no differences exist between version 1.03 and version 1.04
of the Software Development Kit.  Version 1.04 was created almost
solely for  the  purpose  of supporting the IBM Personal System/2
hardware which uses 3 1/2" diskettes and requires modified screen
drivers.  The small list of 1.03 to 1.04 changes which effect the
Software Development Kit is as follows:

     - The files font.asm and font.obj were added to the Software
Development  Kit  in  order  to facilitate font development.  The
file, fonts.asm, is the "dummy code module" referred to in step 1
of section B.4 of the  B  Appendix in the Programming Guide.  The
file,  fonts.obj, is  simply the compilation of fonts.asm.  These
two new files are found on the Utilities Disk 2.

     - A  problem  in  Windows' handling  of  local  area network
failures  has  been  fixed.  Previously, Windows would crash if a
server on a LAN  went  down  and Windows had an file open on that
server.

     - Windows now properly restores interrupt zero upon exiting;
this was not previously the case.

     - The interface between Windows  and  the printer  has  been
changed  to  allow for faster printing.  Both the Spooler and GDI
have been changed to use larger packets to facilitate better data
flow.

     - Using a  high resolution screen  with Windows 1.03, it was
sometimes  possible to move an icon off the screen where it would
be  inaccessible.   This  problem  has  been  fixed  in  the 1.04
release.

     - The  USA  keyboard  driver has  been changed to more fully
support the enhanced format of the IBM keyboard.

     - The communications port driver has been changed:  in order
to facilitate the IBM 3812 printer, we now leave DTR set "high."
